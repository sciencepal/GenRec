You're reviewing the whole show here,not individual seasons or episodes. Don't give a low rating just because you didn't like Miley or the 5th series. Keep everything in context and just rate on your overall impression of Black Mirror. Carry on. Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: "...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now â€“ and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy."<br/><br/>The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/ -1 because of that Season 5 that I wished I never knew existed. This is truly an amazing show. The issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. The stories are mostly set in a dystopian world that is dominated or badly influenced by modern technology. What makes "Black mirror" so great is the attention to detail and inter/intrapersonal relationships and how the main character would feel and experience its brave new world.
Well thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. It asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing! Treat yourself and watch this. 9/10 Brilliant.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>This is NOT anti-utopian, it is an actual mirror of a utopian idea gone terribly wrong.<br/><br/>I've only watched 3 episodes so far and each one has made me think, made me go back and look again, made me ask myself why this had never occurred to me before.<br/><br/>I would call this sci-fi in the richest sense of the genre.... it is not about science, but how science affects human beings. The one thing that never seems to change is us. Technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.<br/><br/>I love this show. I hope you will love it too. And I hope you will think. ...season five was bad (episode 1), mildly acceptable (episode 2) and are you kidding me? (episode 3). Miley Cyrus? This series started out as an inventive, original and disturbing show. When it became "Americanized", it went downhill fast. Please, either return to the original premise, or don't put out more trash. The double entendre that is Black Mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.<br/><br/>Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.<br/><br/>Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen. It not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll. I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. <br/><br/>I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. <br/><br/>Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. <br/><br/>There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. <br/><br/>Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us. This is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. This series is one of the best i've seen. Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards? I loved this series. The new season is entertaining occasionally, but it's not Black Mirror.<br/><br/>Please bring it back. I found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling "disturbed". Ermm.... I think that's the intention....<br/><br/>As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent.<br/><br/>This isn't reality TV. This picks out the darkest aspects of how are future in this this modern age could end up, in extremis....<br/><br/>Personally, I think it's a Facebook/Twitter/Flickr/Android/iPhone/Tab/internet horror story and whilst I think it's probably too brutal for most people, it is a reflection of how we give up and of ourselves to the digital, overwhelmingly public way that the world now wants us to be.<br/><br/>I love the show. Will it change my FB or other behavior? No but, truth be told, I might be watching out of the corner of my eye.... I loved Black Mirror from the very first episode when I saw it on Channel 4 years ago. The first three seasons were everything I wanted in an edgy sci-fi show, it was satirical and insightful. It had something to say about society and the human condition.<br/><br/>Then it jumped to Netflix and season four was largely OK. Not everything worked but some of the episodes were classic Black Mirror. Then came Bandersnatch which was good but more of a gimmick than anything else.<br/><br/>Then came season 5. My God, how the mighty have fallen. I got a sense that these episodes were knocked out quickly as the dialogue was awful, the themes had all been touched on before and there were only three episodes. Out of the three only Smithereens was any good but, in comparison to earlier episodes, it was only a shadow of what came before.<br/><br/>Black Mirror used to have bite but Series 5 just sucks, which is all you can do when you've lost your teeth. Watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time. <br/><br/>Depressive in a way, but also genius and defying! The way it makes you question and think about reality and our modern technological ages it's brilliant!<br/><br/>And although being fictional and mostly sci-fi, it's so realistic in the scariest way! <br/><br/>It's not about tech... it's about us and our "human nature", the good and the bad, our best and worst as humans and that is definitely the most disturbing aspect of it all. <br/><br/>Worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical TV series done recently!! <br/><br/>Thank you Mr Brooker and all the team!<br/><br/>P.S.: the first two episodes are probably the most disturbing ones and it's curious that all the bad reviews focus only in the first one... Reading those bad reviews only make more sense to the all series idea... Shocking uh? But wouldn't we be all in the pub watching it? Even the "weak" episodes are better than most of the stuff that Hollyweird is putting out. It's just that good! I really like how it is an anthology series so the episodes are completely unrelated. You can literally watch the last episode and not spoil anything! Just pop it on netflix read the synopsis and choose the one you want to watch depending on the mood you are in. Extremely good show! Very addicting and very well thought out! The actors all do a terrific job! The directing is on-par. The cinematography, breath-taking, the color palette... Everything. This show is extremely DARK, I can not stress this enough, you never know what you are in for... It takes you on one hell of a ride and doesn't let up! I can not believe I slept on it. Possibly the best show on Netflix, highly addicting and Highly recommended! 5 stars + Literally don't even try to binge watch all episodes in a day or two really u will get a kind-of shock and unsettle feeling,some people say its very dark i say watch Dora the explorer instead.Literally whole series has like 22 episodes or so every episode is very unique and brilliantly crafted each and every aspects in it is literally mind-blowingly great,Music was phenomenal.the intro was like unsettle and dark indicating whats all this about,the song of "who knows what love is" is amazing and kind-of thing to tie all episodes in same universe it was a awesome song.the acting in each episode it iconic,the best episode in whole series is The white Christmas it was pure brilliant and shocking episode.the weak not worst episode is waldo moment as per me,the detailed and pure shocking episode would be Black museum,the tech's and gadgets thing and the unsettling way human brain uses it and all it was literally awesome from start,the starting episode is enough to grab the interest,Overall this series is Dark as hell it was philosophically,mentally/psychologically challenging it was thought provoking and self questioning,sometimes it was lite minded and good with nostalgia and sometimes it was ground-breaking,brain-teasing,mind-blowing,shocking,surprising and great,literally words can't describe such TV show it is Pure Art it was DARK,challenging and literally A Masterpiece,The greatest Anthology series about tech in future period!A Must watch! The show does a good job with slow buildup and engaging the audience. They move their audience to a different world and makes them understand the power and admire the capabilities of technology. A good show that makes you question technology and human beings. To sum up this series for me is quite easy, It's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature. <br/><br/>The cast and set are different every time, but one theme I found recurring was that each episode was extremely haunting, and it definitely gets the viewer thinking about what could be if the world was just a little bit different. I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me. <br/><br/>I don't want to write any spoilers, but what I will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely Original make it Black Mirror. I rated 10 this serie. But last season is below average. Everyone loves using big words when talking about Black Mirror. Black Mirror is made up of big words- the show is very flashy and it uses shock value to grab eyes. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed almost every episode I watched. It seems like everything that goes into making the show is done with passion which leaves the viewer satisfied. But it was interesting to learn that one of the least liked episodes among fans is "Hated in the Nation" which is about a vengeful hacker that manipulates government controlled insects to kill people with the contribution of many mindless social media users. It is constructed as a murder mystery with the typical foil duo of detectives. It places a lot of different issues that are of most important right now into the plot: government surveillance, climate change, cyberbullying and mob mentality. It's not as futuristic and flashy- the topics at hand are not of the future but more present. There is no crazy technology the episode is built on. Maybe that is why it's not so popular but it's fascinating to me for the same reason. I don't think I have to make any remarks on season 1-4, they were brilliant and would deserve 9/10 or 10/10.<br/><br/>But season five was just... utter garbage. Episode 2 is a beacon of light in the fog of millennial trash that is episodes 1 and 3. Can't help feeling Charlie brooker sold his soul when he signed up with you know who. Black Mirror is one of the most original and best Mini-Series ever created! Each episode tells a different story and most of them are fascinating. There are a few that are not so good when compared to the others but most of them are fantastic! It's hard to explain how incredible this show is so just go watch it! Season 3 is my favorite. All the episodes in session 3 was great. But in all other seasons , few episodes we're good , few we're bad. It's worth giving a try, if you are a technology, innovation lover. Few episodes we're absolutely brilliant. Black Mirror is still discussing the current problems, over entertainment, over dissemination and over memory, but the writers put their background on the future of advanced technology to increase the effect, which is very good-looking and worth pondering. The depth that English drama can explore is really beyond the reach of other industries. The power of media, public will, and consumerism brought about by advanced technology erode and sink into the past. Each episode is wonderful and worth pondering. From the prime minister's pajamas and dignitaries' uniforms, it reveals a thick black color, and the last section is like a state of war, which makes my back cool! E02 when he used his life to say the declaration of resistance, he finally surrendered to the society that had been corroded by consumerism. Isn't this our life now and in the future? E03 when you can freely view the memories and enlarge their analysis, you will never get out. I liked it all, its a mind-blowing one.
I'd recommend to skip 1st episode of season one then watch the rest, I didn't like season 4 as well. Since you all know each episode is a different story, and its difficult to score the entire series. Few of the stories will blow your mind. Most of them are good. The third episode of Season 5 is very very bad and melodramatic.
The First three seasons were very very good and would get a strong 9/10. Drops a bit at fourth season which to be honest is a 7.5/10.
Overall this is a series that you must watch. Another good thing about it is that you can just pick any episode and start watching. A dystopian British series on the technological future.
With raw moments.
A series that shows in a dry way and without repressing it a future that could await us as humanity with the use of technology.
Each chapter tells a different story and has nothing to do with the others. In fact in each chapter they are new characters.
Some chapters are more sarcastic than others, some more scandalous than others.
The script and the situations are smart.
It raises moral and ethical norms poorly addressed in an extraordinary way.
With fully interpretive endings that leave you thinking about the future of the species.
The interesting thing about this series is that it does not use the Netflix formula of repeating everything.
With 5 seasons and each one of different extension. I gave it 10 stars because there is something for everyone in this show. Of course the main topic is technology and the future of it, but the plot within each episode is incredibly interesting and well put together. There is no way that you won't find something you enjoy about this show. Till the fourth season this was the best thing ever and than came sheete fifth season where you destroy everything f#@% all of you Black mirror is just brilliant. Awesome and a fine blend of sci fi, drama and technologies. Stories are compelling, thrilling and surely keeps you glued. I was surprised by the first season, then binge watched the rest of the season. After season 3 it went downhill. Even season 4 was good to a extent but it completly faded away in season 5. But stiill I would not restrict myself to give this series a 8. This British play is really powerful. Each episode can make a big reversal of people's psychological defense line. It slowly mingles with the people in the story. At last, I feel the sadness of modern high technology, especially the kidnapping in the first episode. The irony is too dark. It lets you examine all kinds of addictions brought by yourself and modern technology. At last, it even satirizes you, and you will still take pictures Exclaimed with both hands. This series changed my view that how I used to see everything. Every day every moment a lot of things happening around us. Those simple little things aren't simple at all. Some times those things can make huge difference in your life. This is one of the best sci-fi shows out there! Every episode explores how some aspect of technology, while it has good intentions, can be used to ruin lives and make us further away from each other. I just love how the show integrates the tech to fit in with a great story. The stories are really engaging, enjoyable, and thrilling. I love watching how the technology becomes exploited. The show also has really deep themes: death, love, memory, and human bonding. The anthology format really works for this show. So worth it!!! Black Mirror is a really well done futuristic/sci-fi/technology based show. Each episode is about an hour long and they almost feel like a movie. The acting is spot on and the cinematography/filming is amazing. Season 5 is shockingly bad. Awful acting. Totally terrible writing. Netflix seem to ruin everything they touch.only 3 episodes and cringeworthy scripts + acting makes each of them unbareable to watch. The creativity is the main problem, especially in modern culture product till 2000's. We always seen main concepts, same approaches and same faces on our TV's, and cinemas. Even trying something different and genius, has become very commonplace. But Black Mirror is totally different and witty. You need only five minute watching to understand this. Different point of view, different stories, different but natural talented faces... Some ideas in this artwork could be disturb you, but this makes it consummate. It questions your life, routines, choices you made, the basic code of ethics you have... At the end, you only feel the happiness of awareness. Thank you for showing me something different than usual, thank you for make me more aware. Black Mirror started out great and has had a good run with the first four seasons. Season five had no quality, despite only consisting of 3 episodes. Rest in peace. This show was one of my top favorite shows and a new season was definitely something to look forward to each year. Episode 1 was good to start off the season, however episode 2 and 3 was not the best! Episode 2 was just boring, and episode 3 with a few adjustments belonged on Disney channel. So disappointing. The actors were great, the storyline however wasn't ! Overall this season did not live up to black mirrors potential! I do encourage everyone to watch previous seasons though. Loved all the previous seasons but 5 was bad! What went wrong? I'm really disappointed. Was looking forward to it for what seemed like a life time. We really don't need a TV show to tell us that there are some rather sick people in the world, let alone for that TV show to treat that sickness as "entertainment".<br/><br/>The thinly veiled premise that this series is somehow telling us something we don't know about the "dark side of technology" is rather pathetic.<br/><br/>In essence, a handful of people have plumbed the depths of their depravity and tried to pass it off as entertainment. It is grotesque, appalling and quite vile. Some of the episodes are simply fantastic. Some of them are just... not. It's up to the people behind each episode. The people writing, acting, producing all change every episode. That's awesome. It means that you get fresh ideas and are able to enjoy a wide range of amazingly creative people. Unfortunately, there are a few combinations that just aren't as good.<br/><br/>On the whole: fantastic. Each part: roll of the dice. Seasons 1-4 are fantastic and a must see.
Bandersnatch was very interesting.<br/><br/>On its own, season 5 is watchable. Compared to the previous years however, it's absolute garbage! I got hooked on this series and I truly loved it.
Then season 5 came out.
Season 5 is boring, overdone and downright cringeworthy. Used to be such an interesting and creepy show and it became a joke having watched all the episodes, there's a lot more bad ones than good.<br/><br/>None of the episodes lack for trying, with a whole lot of effort put into plots and atmosphere and mood that tie in to a general set of moral themes typically involving technology and human nature.<br/><br/>However, a significant number of the episodes start out strong and end up flailing and falling flat with an unhinged or deranged moral message that seems as though it were written by an alien trying and failing to understand the human condition. Incidents which should elicit mercy and understanding are treated with a level of sadistic and creative punishment completely disconnected from coherent judgement or critical thinking, with an atonal shift from the rest of the episode. The idea of revenge in one episode seems not focused on punishing the actual perpetrator, but on the perpetrator's body, essentially wiping a criminal's memory, creating an entirely new person, then punishing that new person for the crimes of someone they no longer are.<br/><br/>The obvious intent of many of the episodes appears to be to make people think about the topics, such as the idea of rating people in real life, or of creating AI copies of people to torture and interrogate so as not to hurt the actual person, or the inherent absurdity of politics. Sometimes it works, but more often it leaves me asking "What was the point of all that?" Season 5 was an utter disappointing departure from Black Mirror. I think they were trying to find new audience base or expand marketing only.<br/><br/>No thrills, no thought-provoking episodes, imbecile plots (third episodes) and agonizingly low acting.<br/><br/>Sheer frustration. I watched the entire show three times already and the most intriguing thing of the whole franchise is the final plot twist that makes the audience questione the meaning of 1h episodes. This last season deluded me, very much. I see that you paid a lot of money for rather famous actors/celebrities that surely weren't required for their acting abilities but for their name and type of real life character, but at least write a good episode, and not 60 minutes of trying to do as good as the first 2 seasons without a worthy script.
I am a big fan of all the black mirror seasons, except this one and bandersnatch. After watching the first episode, I was shocked about the negative reviews it received. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't what I expected but that doesn't make it bad. It was very dark, and very shocking; Had me completely on the edge of my seat throughout. You will have to watch it with an open mind as it is somewhat distasteful and well... extremely far-fetched (Which is pretty absurd for a satire, but I digress.) I did thoroughly enjoy it however, it hit all the right notes.<br/><br/>After watching the second episode, I was left in shock about the jarring contrast from the first episode. It's so different than the prior, it's set in an alternate reality and is just.. unusual. Still dark, still intriguing, but didn't quite capture my imagination the way the first one did.<br/><br/>The third and final instalment was probably my favourite of the 3. It was again, completely unrelated from the previous 2, but it had a really interesting concept and narrative, and was executed phenomenally. <br/><br/>All in all, the series as a whole is very interesting, if somewhat inconsistent. S5 : what happened ? Complete garbage !! Bring back the true Black Mirror ! Can someone explain me why season 5 got so dumb??? Like really, all the originals ideas and suspense and all you know that made it a great... sundadly lost them all to turn it out as another TV show crap?? Please why? My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠<br/><br/>How can anyone rate Black Mirror less than 10?! It's one of the most fascinating TV shows ever.<br/><br/>Favourite Episodes : Be Right Back, San Junipero, Hang the DJ, The Entire History of You, Nosedive and Fifteen Million Merits.<br/><br/>Bring on Season 5! Every episode is suprising and makes you feel small when the clue has been released during the time you are watching it as you think: this is not totally unreal.... it could be true....One of my favorite! Black Mirror was once known for projecting a grim future, 10 minutes away from where we are. We didn't watch it to be amused nor excited, we watched it with the intent of being bummed out. We expected to welcome the credits with an awesome feeling of self loathe. This was the point. Black Mirror is the reflection of yourself in your phone screen when the screen is turned off. A dark reflection of who you are. The intention is to show a dark depiction of ourselves through technology. Exactly what a Black Mirror is.<br/><br/>Throughout its time on Channel4 it was allowed to explore this, thus generating a huge following of people like myself who demand depth, intrigue and not your typical fairytale stories made to meet a wide audience to generate ££. It was so ridiculously thought provoking I would go as far as to say it was one of the greatest TV programmes to come out of the UK! Which leads me to the problem.. it came out of the UK.<br/><br/>I was slightly nervous when I discovered it was moving to Netflix. Anxious as I knew the Americans were going to have a huge hand in the subject matter and storylines, yet marginally comfortable in knowing Netflix (like Channel4) has a reputation for taking risks on out of the box stories. The reason I was anxious about the Americans is not some deep shred of racism. It is simply that there is a huge difference between how British and American audiences receive TV programmes. This is common fact when it comes to comedy, but it is also apparent in emotion inducing drama too. If you study popular American TV versus popular UK TV you can easily see that British audiences are more comfortable with 'out of the ordinary', uncomfortable and especially dark subject matter. We don't mind hating ourselves, in fact we quite like it and are pretty good at it!<br/><br/>Series 3 turned out to be pretty damn good actually. San Junipero in particular is my favourite episode of the whole programme! The programme was allowed to retain that awful feeling of dread, the familiarity, the dark techno-aware subjects that depicted who we could be, who we would be and who we are now! There did seem to be a little more of a Hollywood type of feel to the whole thing, yet that didn't matter too much as long as the stories could run their course!<br/><br/>However. Since then there has been a huge decline in what we come to expect of the show we know and love. USS Callister was, for me a small shining light (or rather a welcome opposite to that entirely), but still didn't give me that sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach. The episodes began to get milder and milder, taming down to suit a wider audience who would be at greater risk of running away If you were to show them an early episode. Yes there was tragedy, yes some of the storylines were dark. But its where the darkness comes from that matters! We didn't want obviously fictional narratives, we wanted ones that seemed real! That could be here and now and not too far away. We didn't want the big dramatic moments, the killer shots or the epic finale, we want mellow darkness and discomfort.<br/><br/>Finally we reach series 5. A series that has completely and utterly disappointed me on all levels. Well, not all. They are entertaining, but definitely not in Black Mirror fashion. Where are the twists, the thought provoking, self hating moments. The situations which present to you a perfectly twisted, yet astonishingly accurate version of the world we live in?<br/><br/>If you were to grab someone who was disinterested in Black Mirror's subject matter, and ignorant of its relevance and show them just a couple of episodes from the first series, but let them just mildly watch it without truly getting it.. then ask them to describe it to you: what you would have is Series 5.... A few entertaining yet dark stories with a bit of technology thrown in. Yes we know that the app they use in episode two is metaphorical of our current social media platforms and how we are all addicted. You are not incredibly smart for figuring that out because it's so blindingly obvious and in your face. Black Mirror has been showing us that same metaphor in so many episodes, but it's been so good because it has been a genuinely clever metaphor and has been presented perfectly!<br/><br/>I genuinely feel as though the smartness of the programme has been lost. That it has now become a parody of itself and is simply a few slightly tragic (but not too tragic) stories with some technology in them. It doesn't take a great deal of intellect or understanding to grasp the concepts. Themes are also being rehashed into more diluted versions that are easier to palette for everyone! This might sound extremely harsh and make me sound like an awful person, but I see from my social media, so many more people talking about how amazing it now is. These people are the type that find films such as White Chicks funny and who's favourite film is Titanic. They talk about how clever the programme is after watching the latest series and that it's got so much more better as they didn't understand the first few series. I find myself internally screaming at them "NO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO APPRECIATE THIS PROGRAMME" the message is lost on so many!<br/><br/>I still have faith, which is why I've given a 9. The first 3 series get 10 from me, the 5th gets a 2. This rating only reflects on season 5.<br/><br/>These episodes seemed to have tried too much to cater to the masses. Almost the TV series version of 90's metallica or post 2009 Muse.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind the changes of being in current times instead of the future and positive endings if they were done in an interesting way. I feel that Smithereens executed this well. On the other two episodes, they brought the show down to the lowest common denominator instead of elevating the thinking of the viewers like previous seasons did.<br/><br/>The first four seasons tied in the episodes in many subtle ways so it was almost as if it was all in the same universe. This season seemed to have dropped all of that and that is the most disappointing aspect for me.<br/><br/>My individual ratings<br/><br/>Striking vipers 6/10-Not a bad concept but a very basic plot. It did touch into the perils of advanced video game technology in a decent way. Could have been about 20 minutes shorter and had better twists. Not the worst episode, but probably in bottom third overall to me<br/><br/>Smithereens 9/10-I expected the least out of this based on "expert" ratings, but it was by far the best. Some complain that it was too much like a crime show, but black mirror has dipped into different genres before. Kept me engaged from beginning to end and stayed true to the franchise in my opinion and an ending that left you hanging in a good way<br/><br/>Ashley Too 4/10- I like the premise of the manipulation of the singer behind the scenes and thought this episode could go somewhere but the ending ruined it leaving no twist and more of an ending that you would see on a teen drama movie. Some say that this paralleled the life of Miley Cyrus and I can respect that premise, but am not sure if Black mirror was the place for it.<br/><br/>Overall, not unwatchable but by far my least favorite season and a mild letdown. Hopefully the next season is more true to its form. This British drama is really powerful, and every episode can make people's psychological defenses turn around again and again, and slowly merge with the people in the story, and finally feel the sadness of modern high-tech, especially the first episode of the kidnapping case The irony is too dark. It allows you to examine the various addictions that you and modern technology bring to you. Finally, it satirizes you by the way, and you will clap your hands. This series caught my thought and displayed it on international media. This is not fun watching-it's mostly horrifying-but even if our brave new world is inescapable, the show represents a kind of protest that feels more necessary than ever. This show makes you think a lot, which is good. Charlie Brooker is a certain talent and I can't wait to see what stories he comes up with next. This show is probably one of the most draining shows you will watch. Once episode a week is enough for me. This show is seriously incredible! Every episode is so intriguing and great in it's own unique way and it really gets you thinking. If you're considering watching this absolutely do it! I watched it the first time thinking "oh idk if i'll like this it kinda seems weird" and now it's my favourite show and i've watched it several times! There's at least one episode for everyone but i was personally captivated by every single episode. This is my go to show to recommend to anyone and everyone. Black mirror offers a journey into the future, although it is created for entertainment purposes. Being a series initially shown on Channel 4 (UK), then Netflix, it provides entertainment quality.
Each episode is different, each futurist theme they cover in the episodes vary. It has a British identity to the drama, although some of the more recent episodes have been tainted by Hollywood.
If you want to be blown away, the themes, the twists will take you on an emotional journey. By far one of the best series ever made, hats off to Konnie & Charlie. Great Series, Amazing Ideas, Creative Writers, Something Special, Cinematography and Colors is Great.
I Wish the Next Seasons Would Be Better. I love the tv show it's amazing!
Since it's the vivid-19 pandemic & people are addicted to Netflix, why don't you produce an episode related to a virus pandemic in the future? I found some story which i have use to image ..i directly saw in this series ...its very impressive So as weird as it may sound I only just got into watching BM, I had heard of it but just never gotten around to it I guess, but with everything going on I have been watching them but not binge watching cuz they are very heavy and dark and leave you leaving disturbed. However despite that I'm sure I don't have to tell anyone just how brilliant it is now having seen most of the episodes. As I said this show us on par with the godfather of anthology shows TZ and I think if Rod Serling was alive today this is these are the kinds of stories he would write i think. Charlie Brooker is a genius writer who really has a grasp on where we are and where we are heading with technology and all the good and really bad that can come with it. In Hated in The Nation that one really showed the bad of pack mentality and the vicious jerks people can be in social media, I only rarely use FB, and the that one really hit home for me. So If you are looking for something to watch with absolutely brilliant writing, acting, cinematography and plot twists you will never see coming do yourself a favor and watch Black Mirror. God this series is so good yall who havent watched u rly shld go check it out. after watching each episode, your brain gon full of stuff going on in ur head. its just so awesome. i- One of my favorite series is, a 10 but without the last season All the episodes have a good setup with nice story line. The idea behind the films also makes you will need to think about it. Som episodes are quite close to what is going to happen in the future now. Really like this serie. If you want to mess with your mind, Black Mirror is the show to watch. While taking pieces of current society, it creates a world that is believable. I wouldn't say it's necessarily horror or anything along those lines, but it gives you a chill throughout your body. I also love how each episode is unique of its story, so it doesn't necessarily drag on like other shows.
The acting is great mostly, sometimes it isn't the best - but the strong actors pull through. The scenery, plot, costuming, etc. is outstanding. It's a diverse cast, and you can understand how the talent got to be there.
I love Black Mirror. Thanks for messing with my mind, and creating the idea that the world we live in, may be a simulation <3 This was the best TV show ever! The 5th season is disaster and very disappointed! All episodes of the first four seasons were something to remember and they all had some kind of message. The last season must be a joke, it cannot taken seriously.
No message, no deep layer, nothing to think. Just a thin story with a happy end.
It's more like a Disney movie. Black Mirror season 5 was hot garbage. ONE interesting "black mirror" type subject executed poorly, ONE okay episode with zero black mirror'ness and one pile of hot hologram Tupac garbage trying to be passed through with "star" power.<br/><br/>Jeepers. Watched through all seasons.
Some episodes were quite good, but most of them were mediocre at most.
I loved the idea of everything being so advanced in terms of technology, but that was about it.
The stories are pretty meh, and the acting is pretty meh in most of them as well.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this series to a friend? No, I would not. I had rated this series 9 for the first seasons as rating 10 would not have left me room in case of even better than before. But the last season disappointed me too much not to review my rating...and review. The very first seasons (until season 3) are nearly perfect. Season 4 has its ups and down but it is still interesting. This season 5 is very disappointing. I don´t know if there will be a season 6 but I am definitely stopping here. Not sure why anyone would give this a good review, other than the fact that they must have a sick demented soul. I could not watch more than 2 episodes. I don't really want to give away the plot, but it starts off with a woman screaming, and lead into someone having to have sex with a pig on national TV. I did not watch much more than that THIS SHOW IS FOR PERVERTED PEOPLE. The show seems to try really hard to be thought provoking and unpredictable but the end result is exactly the opposite. Most episodes make their point within the first 10-15min and then they beat it into absurdity which makes the show a chore to watch.<br/><br/>I don't understand what the hype is around this show, it's nothing revolutionary and most of the time it just comes across as pretentious, go watch the Outer Limits, it's much better written and the ending is almost always a surprise. The first season was excellent 10/10. The fifth season was a joke. Is it because it's American? I dont know, but it sux. I gave it a good go, it's slow and boring with no fantastic ending to make up for it.<br/><br/>If you're someone who already watches a lot of 'out there' programmes be it futuristic Sci fi, dark humour, horrors then you will not like this show, It will bore you.<br/><br/>I've read through some reviews people wrote that being shocked was the point of the show, I wasn't shocked, I was bored. I tried a couple of episodes in series 1 and one episode in series 4 just to see if it got better, Arkangel was awful. People who were involved in this production
Shouldn't be able to work in the Movie business anymore. I'm embarrassed I even watched this junk. ( the current season ). The first episode is just pointless. What is sad is how pathetically lovers of this thing come across. They read so much depth and intelligence into it. There's nothing there. It's clear that the ending was conceived first, and then a story (a truly weak one) was written to support it. My problem with it isn't THAT the PM would eff a pig to save someone's life (queue the "we don't negotiate with terrorists" people) or even that the princess could be so easily kidnapped, with no clues left behind.<br/><br/>One, the thought that someone should have to pork a pig (to save a human life) is presented as a real dilemma for everyone involved. Really? This is the worst thing one can imagine? Seriously, just think about it for a minute-and-a-half. The idea of it is portrayed in such a way that the PM and everyone around him (including his stupidly unsupportive wife) act like it's so dire. All one has to do is imagine the captive is their own childand it's dilemma over in three seconds. The whole idea of doing it puts the characters in such fits of anguish, such outward displays of inner turmoil that you'd think the world was coming to an end.<br/><br/>I could come up with a million things that might actually bring about the melodramatic anguish that the characters play out. It's incongruous. Or is this a British thing? Is this how British people would react (honestly) to such a scenario?<br/><br/>Two, citizens tune in to watch together at sports pubs as if it's a World Cup final. The Nation looks excited and jazzed as if they think it will be funny and not demoralizing to anyone. Drinks all around! Then, when the act actually takes place, everyone looks surprised, like they expected it to be humorous but then were shocked when it turned out to be unwatchable. Really, they all couldn't imagine that in real life it wouldn't be funny?<br/><br/>Three, the conversation about the approval rating is unnecessary. That such a conversation COULD or WOULD take place is just the writers proposing a conspiracy as if that territory is food for thought. Are politicians that horrid? Maybe. If they were, would it be news to anyone? Again, it's just a cheap shot, not a revelation. <br/><br/>Four, the captor is SO amazingly advanced that he can fool the British government. He expects their every move, plans contingencies for them, and punishes them in real time when they act predictably. But, evil as he is, he cuts off his OWN finger instead of that of the princess. Why does he care? He's already kidnapped her, harmed her, scared her half-to-death, emotionally tortured her, brought her to the brink of insanity, but cutting off her finger is just whattoo far? Further, no one can seem to tell the difference between a female finger when it is delivered to them in real time. How did he arrange to get it delivered to them so fast? Who delivered the finger? Why did he bother to put it on ice??? How did he do it through the pain? Sure, he kills himself at the end. So, he's suicidal? Suicidal people don't plan extravagant terrorist acts (with no true consequences) and then kill themselves after. What would be the point?<br/><br/>Five, the PM's wife acts like the PM is betraying her and their marriage somehow. She becomes distant and cold to him immediately as if he wasn't just forced to perform a demoralizing act to save someone's life-which appears to have worked. They act like nothing's wrong in public, but then behind closed doors, can't even get a hug from her. He was raped. Imagine the reverse. A woman is the PM, and she has to take it from a horse or a large dog or something. Then after the act, the husband treats her insensitively, and without empathy?<br/><br/>Lastly, the writers feel the need to add an extra shot of cheap, predictable nonsense by staging a phone call during which the PM's aid is told she was released 30 minutes prior to the act with the pig. It's another cheap shot that is below the creativity belt of any self-respecting artist. We're also supposed to believe that someone went through the trouble of time-lining the whole thing precisely enough to discover the 30 minute window in the first place. It would be after the fact, because, the news of the princess being found couldn't have been kept mum for 30 minutes. Word would have gotten to someone and it would have halted the pig scene. But, someone (who knows who) time-lined it right away, cause THAT's what was on everybody's mind at the time?<br/><br/>Why am I writing this to slam one episode? Because the real tragedy here is that so many people are taken in by it. Production values are all that matters. People are so easily entertained and so boring that anything which filmed well, with decent actors will hypnotize them.<br/><br/>I watched episode 2 anyway. I watched it because of the decent acting and production values, hoping that the first episode was just a mistake. I should have known better. Anyone who would lead a series with an episode this poor, doesn't advertise much promise. The second episode, "Fifteen Million Merits" is less cheap, but just as pointless. It is also excruciatingly dull. Mind you, I watched it with bated breath the whole time, expecting something meaningful to happen. I wasn't bored, but it was dull. Don't know if that makes sense to anyone. In the end, it was as the first. It's just that we live in this world where everything is dire, cynical, pointless, meaninglessjust add water (plot). This seems to be the flavor of the show, so two is enough. Go ahead; tell me I'm really missing out. I'll take my chances and watch reruns of "As Time Goes By" instead. Watched the first episode, wondered where the heck it was going, then once the VR game got started, it got ridiculously stupid. After the acclaim of that one episode with the girl from Halt and Catch Fire, you can see this is the direction they wanted to go in from here on out.<br/><br/>What tacky, self-serving propaganda. I'm out. Have at it. "How did humanity reach this point? Will our future look like this?" I watched many episodes of this show by asking myself these questions. Each chapter is a different approach to think about the future of the world. And you will be notice that many of them look very scary. Black Mirror has been one of my favorites. It really missed the mark in Season 5. And olny three episodes in season 5 but that might be a good thing. Episode 2 was OK. Episode 3 with Cyrus was the pits but she can mess up anything. What were they thinking? S5: Certainly the worst season of Black Mirror thus far. 'Smithereens' was great only thanks to Andrew Smith's brilliant performance. ** This review contains spoilers **<br/><br/>I was trying to find a new series to watch on Netflix, and, missing the amazing (but deceptive) Jinni, browsed 'similarshows'. This show came up as one of one of four 'Mind Boggling Shows Like The X-Files'. I never really got into X-Files, but quite liked the bits I saw. IMDb's score (for BM) was 8.9, so I thought it was well worth checking out.. Big mistake. similarshows certainly got the 'mind boggling' aspect right, but they missed the word 'awful'. If only I'd checked the reviews here first, as some share my view and would've warned me. Not only was the main theme of the first episode repulsive, it was completely ridiculous. <br/><br/>I guess I'm one of those who 'missed the messages... ' '...the relationship between technology and psychology'.. Well the tech. fell down for me when they didn't realise a dismembered finger was actually a man's; and as for the psychology: man kidnaps girl, man makes fantastically ridiculous demands, PM says no, one of his staff makes incredibly stupid mistake, his subordinates say he must comply, his wife cries, he decides he will (or more accurately, he's bullied into it), evidence is available to show the man is unlikely to kill the girl but they ignore it, everyone, including the kids, watches 'the act' on national TV, at tea time. 'It' apparently goes on for over an hour, then afterwards they find out that the guy released the girl before the act had begun, then topped himself. Maybe I am missing something, but I really can't see much depth to it at all. I found the psychology of 'The Fall' deep, immersive and disturbing. Not this.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of watching more of something that's rubbish (imo) just to see if it gets better.. If that's what floats the creators' boats (and a multitude of viewers who thought it was 'outstanding' (as did the Emmy's it seems), 'brilliant' and 'the best show ever', I'll jump ship. As a whole I love the Black Mirror series, for me it's been like a modern day version of The Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. And for a time, it would consistently give me this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach after each episode, which meant it truly touched me and disturbed me to my very soul. This is the heart of Black Mirror, and what made it so popular.<br/><br/>I'm afraid for season 5, a season that is very short by the way, only 3 episodes, that they strayed away from. While the acting has always been top notch, and still is, there are no complaints in this department, at the end of each episode it failed to really hit me, failed to leave me feeling disturbed. Mostly I think this is due to each episode ending in a happy sort of way.<br/><br/>If this is what the writing crew, and the directors of the series were hoping to achieve, then they have succeeded brilliantly.<br/><br/>But this series prided itself, and was built on the principle of technology and humanity clashing, and bringing out the dark side of humanity no matter how advanced our society becomes, so in that aspect, I am afraid it has failed miserably.<br/><br/>I only hope that Netflix realizes this, and can make some changes and improve it again for season 6. A rare drama of a hundred years,better than the movie of the same name. Remove all famous actors
Bring back the original feeling<br/><br/>Used to love this series but season 5 ruined the thing Whats new in the season 5 ? Episode 1&2 is just repeated to episodes already shown before.
Episode 3 there is no anything special about it . I watched half of episodes 2 and 3 in the first season, but couldn't get through either of them. I heard this show was supposed to be scary, which is why I tried to get into it. If there there is something scary, then they need to move some of the scary parts to the beginning of the episodes to give me a reason to care about the characters and endure the slow parts. As far as I can tell, this show is just about a lot of dumb technology ideas. Some every day people do ordinary things, and interact with the technology. How is that a show? How is that interesting? I just don't get it. Is it to warn about bad technology ideas? If so, I don't really see why that is interesting either. Maybe if the characters were interesting, and did something interesting and unusual, then maybe that could be a show. The high ratings for this genuinely perplexes me. Really? Gave this up almost immediately.
Depressing, unimaginable, unexciting and slow paced.
I've got better things to do with my time... Nowadays, when we have been pursuing the reality of the game experience, perhaps this movie will give us some reminders of the crisis. How to grasp the degree of the virtual world and the real world is what we currently blindly ignore in the final pursuit of virtual experience.
The rise of social software has provided us with a lot of platforms to share our feelings and get praise. Perhaps we now rarely think about how much responsibility for current traffic accidents and other unpredictable natural disasters and man-made disasters is because of mobile phones and other high-tech The product caused, I think if really investigated, these manufacturers should not be held responsible, perhaps these problems have to be considered by these business giants.
The emergence of robots has played a big role in various fields. The materials of real singers are concentrated in a cute robot, which can bring us closer to our idols, but many of the things that are shown to us on stage are in real life. This is not the case. The truth behind each brilliant and splendid lens is that we cannot have a clear judgment. You'll never get the same thing twice and will be gripped to the edge of your seat. You won't know how to feel until the credits roll and I love every roller coaster of emotion. Black mirror was superb , each episodes are wonderful , and it keeps curiosity till the end , and every episodes are better than another episodes , whole seasons like just WOW !!! There is not enough episodes in a season.<br/><br/>each episode is different from the last and revolves around technology.
i do like the fact that all the characters are different too.
its tough to review a series with a different plot for each episode,
but I really enjoyed it.
you will have episodes that you loved and some that are meh.
recommend watching the trailer just remember each one is different than the last.
enjoy ... RMD Season 1-4 are amazing. I rated 10/10 for all. But season 5, there's no Black mirror elements in all 3 episodes. I was so excited and started on 5th June itself.<br/><br/>All 3 are very average stories, The 2nd and 3rd episode is very predictable and 1st one has a small twist that too not that imapct full.<br/><br/>
Overall season 5 left no mark at all. One can give it skip. Some people can't get enough of it and some seem to hate it. Reviewers who are saying S5 is not Black Mirror appear to want each episode to fit into a certain perceived format and anything outside of that is rubbish. Stifling people's creativity. Maybe it is just a little too high brow for some. I thought the basic premise was to build a story around some form of internet technology and how it effects people or society on the whole. Each episode throughout and especially in S5 does exactly that. What is the problem? Good TV can sometimes make you squirm in your seat or make you feel awkward. It challenges your way of thinking. Brilliant! I definitely want more. Because "Black Mirror" is an anthology series, it is, by nature, uneven. That said, there are more good episodes than bad. There is not a single episode that doesn't make you think. This series has some of the best episodes I have ever seen on TV. Some will make you uncomfortable, others are more upbeat, but none disappoint. I have my favorites, but will just say to watch the entire series. One of the best series I've ever watched. Brilliant, thought-provoking, realistic. BUT the 5th season is a disaster. I watched 2,5 episodes; hoping for something good to come up, thinking it must be me who doesn't appreciate the genius but no, it's really a huge dissapointment! Wow, this series in the first few seasons was truly remarkable. Shut up and dance, black museum, were so well done with excellent story lines. This season, feels like I'm being preached to. Not interested in watching two black men have some sort of weird non gay relationship virtually, and the ending was pathetic, were the mans wife gets to go to virtual bars and pickup men. The acting was bad, the story lines were bad, and Netflix has just botched this entire series. So sad because this show was one of the best. What I find joyfull about this serie is that you don't have to watch each episode in a specific order, they are all independent from eachother with different stories and characters. A common theme however throughout the serie is the inevitable demise of the main protagonist. Whether being killed, psychologically tortured or in some rare cases coming out on top there is always an element of tragedy and despair in each episode mixed with some dark humor.<br/><br/>The first two episodes I watched where "Shut up and dance" and "The national anthem", both takes place in current times with the same technology we have access to today. I found these first episodes to be accelerating, alarming and somewhat disturbing. But what is truly frightful is the fact that these horror scenarios can happen to anyone anywhere(if precatutions are not taken) which I think is the genius of this show.<br/><br/>With our technology moving forward at an increasing speed I do think that safty issuses and moral questions concering the use off new devices(and whether they shall exist or not)may become an issuse, Black mirror shows what "can" happen in some extreme cases.<br/><br/>Writer Charlie Brooker really brings something new to the table which Is something I am highly fond off. My only concern with the show are a few episodes that i found somewhat exaggerated and way to unrealistic. The episodes that do it for me are those that infact are realistic with a twisted interpretation of modern technology. Some examples are white christmas and nosedive.<br/><br/>If you like thrillers and horrors I think this serie is worth a go. It sometimes gives me an urge to disconnect from todays accessories. I've read lots of good reviews, so I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>Episode 1 is just so out-of-it and so unrealistic that it made me cringe. <br/><br/>In short: a royal family-member is kidnapped and the prime minister has to do an indecent act to set her free, live on TV. I thought: "No way, they will find a solution to it, because this is what the story about: twisting and turning to come up with something brilliant". Nope, they let the prime minister do an indecent act, live on TV so that the whole world can watch. To make it even worse, his whole staff is pushing him to do it!<br/><br/>I mean, common!!!!! How far away from realism can that be? I know it's not a documentary, but they might as well let some aliens come over and save the girl! There are few nations that give in to kidnapping. They might pay some ransom but they will definitely do it behind the scene. Usually, they crack down on them with brute force. So, to have a minister do an indecent act live on TV to "pay" for the ransom is just ridiculous. No nation that respects itself would even think of giving in to this!! At the end you even know who did it and why... that even ridicules the whole thing to a magnitude of 7.<br/><br/>I thought that maybe the second episode would be good, but it's even worse, because there is no tension behind it. Just something that drags on for an hour or so. This is the first review I have written for IMDb, but I was so shocked, so very very shocked at how utterly utterly bad this was in the face of such a high rating, I felt I had to voice my opinion as a public service, to prevent others from going through what I just went through. I feel conned after looking at this particular IMDb rating. I find IMDb ratings are usually quite reliable, but not this time. I am not going to give ANY spoilers, I am just going to say that if it was someone's intention to make something as dire as possible, then then this was achieved. Everything about this was bad. I cannot believe how this got the ratings it did. How on earth could anyone rate this higher than awful. If you decided to try this, and a third of the way through you think to yourself 'surly it can't be this bad, it has to get better' then I am sorry to say you will be sorely disappointed. It doesn't get better. When you start to think to yourself that this story is unrealistic, un-ironic, and beyond awful believe me when I say you that that's the best it's gonna get, & trust me when I say it won't ever get that good again, just worse, much much worse. Give up with it, and find something else to watch. My best advice will be, please, don't bother with this at all. You've been warned!!! Not sure what happened but every other season was so badass.
Last season was just ridiculously disappointing. 1 star Black Mirror has been by far, my favorite series in decades comparable only to The Twilight Zone and of course, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Black Mirror managed to surpass BOTH for me which is no small feat, combining both sci-fi and mystery with an ongoing theme of strange curiosity that evokes both imagination and emotion. I found myself quite literally on the edge of my seat with each and every episode, ruminating over each episode that graced my screen after watching and anxiously anticipating the next episode - and series - with disappointment and feeling a great void when they were over. This was true with each and every episode from series 1 through series 4. I am still ranking this series as a whole an 8 out of 10 which would have been a strong 10 without reservation had it not been for series 5. Now, we reach series 5 and I'm more confused than disappointed. I'll explain...
While there have been only 3 episodes thus far in the 5th season, they all seem to have an ongoing theme of absurdity. Well, almost uselessness. The 1st episode is interesting but way too far-fetched and predictable than remotely possible which is the key element in what creates good mystery and sci-fi in the first place. This episode, it's just silliness. And, if you happen to have strong core values you may want to view this before showing it to your children. Even my husband who is a die-hard sci-fi addict found it not only absurd but revolting, just FYI, and we are absolutely open-minded and accepting of alternative lifestyles and views. The second episode is a regurgitated lesson from back in 2010 and is equally predictable. The 3rd episode is definitely sci-fi approved however there was way under zero mystery and was more predictable than the first 2 episodes. I will say though, that the addition of the altered 90's lyrics from 25 years ago was a nice touch. It's as though they shoved Charlie Brooker (who I admire greatly) into a closet and said "You have 3 days, come up with 3 episode stories." They're terrible. And, to a certain degree they have all been done before. I won't mention how or where as this would create spoilers. The directing was awful. So, what happened? I know this is probably thought of, by some, as an amazing piece of modern work but I am clearly not one of them. I never write reviews but I hated this so much I couldn't stop myself. If this stops only one person from sitting through this awful programme then I have done a good job.<br/><br/>I sat through most of the first episode, screaming at my husband to turn it off before I was sick ended our experience of Black Mirror. I can honestly say I am ashamed I lasted as long as I did. It is a piece of the worst television I have ever seen. This is supposed to be disturbing and thought provoking but what it does is depicts people as sick, voyeuristic individuals who all, without exception, take pleasure out of watching people destroy their lives (even the hospital staff who all appeared to not have any work to do so were sat watching tv for hours). I am disturbed that people even think up this type of tat, let alone are allowed to record it for viewers pleasure. <br/><br/>It is disgusting, deeply upsetting and something that no-one should watch. I would say I am offended by it but that makes me sound like a prude and that I certainly am not. I am just someone who wants to watch tv for pleasure at the end of the day. This does not bring pleasure, it is not kind, well told or well written and all I am left with is that I can't believe there are people out there who think these sort of stories up. <br/><br/>This is a horrible, horrible, horrible piece of television. Please avoid it if at all possible. It will leave you with such a negative opinion of the world and human nature. I am not sure who would like this but it needs to come with a warning. Yuk! This show was absolutely amazing until season 5 which has evolved into a boring, Americanised pile of garbage. This was a an amazing series that sold out. Season 5 episode 3 is the pinnacle of how far black mirror has fallen If I had to pick 5 words to describe Black Mirror it would be those. Add that they're all exceptionally well- made pieces of art.<br/><br/>Recommended for appreciators of proper sci-fi, cerebral thought experiments, philosophy and those who wonder what modern social tech might be doing to our human nature. Also if you enjoy anthologies ala Outer Limits & Twilight Zone.<br/><br/>Not recommended if you're in the mood for binging on 'just-one-more' series arcs or you fancy light entertainment. Black Mirror is heavy-going and encourages concentrated viewing and musing afterthoughts, personally I couldn't binge on it.<br/><br/>I needed almost a month to watch all 19 eps, so about one a day which is as bingey as it should be. Watch it in order as you get a little appreciation of how the BM-universe expands.<br/><br/>One fine thing to point out is that Black Mirror's cast is genuinely diverse without making a crazed identity-politics agenda out of it...people are people, and that's how it should be.<br/><br/>
My ep rankings:<br/><br/>10/10: Hated in the Nation / USS Callister<br/><br/>9/10: Fifteen Million Credits / White Christmas / The Entire History Of You<br/><br/>8/10: Nosedive / Men Against Fire / The National Anthem / Playtest / Metalhead / Black Museum<br/><br/>7/10: San Junipero / Be Right Back / The Waldo Moment<br/><br/>6/10: Shut Up And Dance / White Bear<br/><br/>5/10: Hang The DJ / Arkangel<br/><br/>2/10: Crocodile<br/><br/>Everyone uses the out-of-ten system differently. In my book a maximum 10/10 is very rare, and 9's relatively rare (about as rare as my 1/10's & 2/10's)...so props to BM for having five such exceptionally strong episodes, plus plenty of strong 8's. Anything from a 6/10 is worth a watch, 5/10 is borderline ok so that leaves just the one genuinely poor story. Oddly enough those three weakest eps all came in a row, tho' of course your experience will differ.<br/><br/>Weighting the balance positively Black Mirror deserves an overall 9/10 putting it right up there in my top 5 favourite series ever, above Game of Thrones & Breaking Bad. Alongside Twin Peaks & classic Twilight Zone. Below only the modern Battlestar Galactica.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen any yet and my spoiler-free review speaks to you, I can only add don't judge the series on its very first episode (it strongly divides opinion), the next two however should blow you away! Great show. Honestly. It messes with your mind. But someone who knows how to get in contact with the creators or a producer - tell them they need to do an episode based off of 1984 by George Orwell. I'm embarrassed there are so many good reviews here, it exudes pretentious, elitist posturing to me. <br/><br/>I watched the first episode for the three minutes it took to get to bestiality and that is more than enough for me. Writers, Directors and any performer who pushes the edge of morals and ethics to go for shock are merely demonstrating their lack of talent and creativity.<br/><br/>Many people today like to be shocked or pretend they are open to anything in a movie or book. But, when you go too far, and accept anything you will change and be different which will change your morals and ethics. This is the sliding scale of ethics that leads to so much acceptance of verbal and physical violence in today's world against people who simply disagree with you. The world would be a much better place if there was universal cultural embarrassment at physical and verbal violence. Much more impact than banning guns. If you really enjoy indulging your depression, feelings of paranoia about society, and hatred of technology, you'll probably like this show. If, like me, you don't, you'll find this series utterly unwatchable. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of The Twilight Zone, and for those that try to compare Black Mirror to it, what on Earth are you talking about? TZ had social commentary, sure, but it was renowned for great plots with ironic or twist endings, not poorly drawn out plots that leave you drained of all joy. Which is what Black Mirror does every single episode. <br/><br/>Like I said, unless you enjoy that type of entertainment, avoid this garbage. Black Mirror is one of the best shows currently on TV. The updated Twilight Zone-style show blends twisted reality with technology in the near future. Each episode from season 1-4 is easily watchable and at least very good, while many episodes are brilliant. Sometimes the twist isn't at the end...but at the beginning or the middle...it always keeps you on your toes and delivers. You find yourself saying, "I could see that happening within the next 5-10 years." And some of the plot lines are starting to drift into reality today. Black Mirror seasons 1-4 are a must watch.<br/><br/>Then there is the fifth season. Do not bother. Each show is terrible. The stories get ridiculous, are pointless, or have characters you just do not care about. Like too much in Hollywood these days diversity was put ahead of story the episode called Striking Vipers. It has an LGBT storyline...that isn't really LGBT...and doesn't seem to know what to do with itself other than check off a box for an LGBT theme. They weren't willing to go where it needed to go or just thought virtual reality sex would be enough to make it interesting...it does not. Check out the earlier episode, San Junipero for a brilliant LGBT storyline that works on all levels. Episode 2 in season 5 is completely forgettable. And episode 3 with Miley Cyrus attempts to make you feel sorry for vacuous pop stars but instead makes you hate them all the more. Season 5 seemed mailed in without much effort.<br/><br/>Season 6 needs to be a great improvement or the show could lose viewers. Watch seasons 1-4...skip season 5 altogether. Now don't get me wrong black mirror is amazing. It shows possibilities of inventions and anti-utopias in the future and some are happening today. But Season 5 feels to Americanised and just crappy. The only decent episode in season 5 is smithereens. But then you have the other two. The Ashley O one is just crap. And striking vipers is OK. The whole idea of black mirror is the abuse of technology and how it effects people. But I feel like after season 4 it's just gone down. For my advice watch all the way through season 1-4 because mostly all of them are good with some off them which are OK but still are good concepts. And in season 5 just watch smithereens and maybe striking vipers don't watch the Ashley O episode. Otherwise except from them episodes the series is really good and I would recommend it. This is an AMAZING show up until the latest episodes. Did they switch writers? It's just garbage now which is quite sad considering how great it was before. I watched the opening episode of this series in that faint hope that a series would come along that MAYBE had some really timeless qualities that the Twilight Zone had, namely, smart, innovative, fantasy, horror, science fiction. What I came across was an absolute waste of time. After watching the series opener "National anthem" I was horrified. Horrified that someone would conceive and execute such a vile, disgusting piece of television such as this. Instead of fantasy, charm, literacy, and magic, we get an absolutely disgusting piece of rubbish. Rod Serling is turning over in his grave after this garbage was likened to TZ by Netflix. Everyone involved in this should be embarrassed, but I doubt that's possible anymore in the world we live in. But I guess that was the point wasn't it? Please do yourself a favor and watch literally anything but this. Watched the first 2 episodes with my wife and I have to say this is the most awful thing I've seen in a long time, no real plot and the first episode should have been enough to drive me away but everyone I talked to said the show was good and I thought maybe the first ep just got off on the wrong foot but no the shows rubbish.<br/><br/>I'm shocked this has such a high rating on IMDb and disappointed I wasted a whole night watching this. <br/><br/>SPOILER: <br/><br/>Really the first episode is about f$#%ing a pig..... I mean come on who wants to see this, yes I understand the episode was making a point but it was just.....awful. I was very disappointed by Black Mirror Series 1 & 2, save for S1E3 - the only instalment NOT written by Charlie Brooker (instead penned by Jesse Armstrong of 'Peep Show' fame), 'The Entire History of You', which on its own is an excellent drama.<br/><br/>I went away from this series with one conclusion; Charlie Brooker cannot write drama well. His talents lie with casting an eye over the irritating aspects of media, succinctly cutting down the pretentiousness and rubbish churned out for our consumption with some accurate criticism and adolescent musings (see: Screenwipe, Newswipe etc.). That's what he's good at! Being funny and critical at the same time.<br/><br/>What he clearly isn't good at, and this is made all the more apparent by the 2nd series of Black Mirror, is fleshing out basic ideas for a drama into anything more than a GCSE Film Studies project with a budget. The characters aren't real, they're two-dimensional clichÃ©s. The constant references to social media and modern technology don't feel incidental, but desperate, like Charlie poking his head up from behind a prop screaming "Look how relevant this all is!" Twitter this, twitter that. The stories all feel like conversations down the pub after a few pints, "What if the prime minister had to shag a pig on live TV!" "Why would he do that?" "I dunno... terrorists?" Even with the suspension of disbelief, none of his writing delivers the impact or level of social commentary one would hope for.<br/><br/>'The Entire History of You' did what the other instalments didn't; characters that felt real, a relationship that felt real, underpinned but not obscured by plausible science-fiction. The 'what if' is answered with the expected pessimism present in all of the Black Mirror episodes, but it's still entertaining to watch the story unfold. I wish Jesse Armstrong had written all of Black Mirror, perhaps I would have had my expectations exceeded rather than trodden on. Damnn What a Amazing Web Series - its remind me SHORT LOVE+DEATH ROBOTS ! EPIC<br/><br/>If you like unique narratives that will play on every emotion... this is the show for you People seem to blame the messenger on here. Of course I'm going to let seasons 4 & 5 influence my review. It's not our fault the series sold out so hard. The first couple seasons were amazing. Intense, shocking, dark, confronting, intelligent, horrible. They leave you with a feeling that everything is most certainly not going to be okay, you feel like you've run an emotional marathon, not in a good way. It's great. Season 4 was very hit and miss. Season 5 was a stinker. I don't understand how the same people who loved series one can also love series 5? Anyways, try it, if you love season 1, watch it until season 4 knowing it become quite generic and dumbed-down in the end. Skip season 5. It is very well thought most of the time, it shows problems that technology might bring in a very original way but it seems on the verge of technofobia...which I do not agree with.Sometimes it is not clear what it wants to say, there is no meaning to derive...or the problem, practical or ethical , is so far fetched that it doesn't feel realistic!!! This show has some deep meanings.. I mean I'd say the majority of the episodes from all seasons have a really good message and or it just makes you think about things or the society that we live in. Some episodes are wayyyyyy out there but I didn't mind that at all. If you like sort of weird quirky shows this show would be perfect for you. To be honest, I am a huge fan of black mirror.<br/><br/>But, season 5 es is let down. The only good episode is the 3rd one. The 2nd one has nothing to do with black mirror universe and doesn't deliver at all. It's awful.<br/><br/>The first episode is a bit better but has nothing in it that pops up...<br/><br/>I can't stand they've had 1.5 years just to deliver 3 episodes of this low caliber.
I hope they will release another 3 at the end of this year. Bandersnatch gave me hope season 5 would be so good, guess the mindblowing twists and stories have been used up... what a shame! This is so unusual. Writer really thinks outside the box. Some episodes have been good. Others have been "effing wow" from my point of view. I really enjoyed the series and look forward to the next (please hit us with another 6 episodes! I felt robbed by the latest series that only had 3!). Its creepy. Imaginative. And damn right scary in some senses! Well done Charlie you dark angel! Season 5 is a dark drama, but it is not Black Mirror. Yes it uses tech, and yes it is dark, but doesn't have the innovation that we associate with Black Mirror. Seasons 1-4 were brilliant. All unique themes woven into creative stories that unraveled at just the right pace.<br/><br/>Season 5, not so much. It had nothing to do with the noticeably more mainstream actors; they didn't have much to work with. The writers seemed to rehash technology themes, but didn't work up the sickening sense of dread that we've come to expect of Black Mirror.<br/><br/>Without it, the season feels forced and preachy. Ultimately, I was bored with Season 5. Good thing each episode is standalone, otherwise the entire series would be ruined. Remember that sick twisted feeling you get after watching one of these episodes? Weird right? So skip season 5. Cool ideas, ok tv but horribly written and put together. I don't call season 5 black mirror. It's dumb and just not as gripping as most other seasons. Like remember shut up and dance? Or hang the DJ? Season 5 is not even close to those episodes. Watch it if you please but lower your expectations. I don't know what too make of Black Mirror. I know I don't like it, but I don't know if it's because the show is bad, or if it's because it's tapping in to something that's going on in the world right now that I don't see, or can't relate too. It makes me feel kind of stupid. I've heard a lot of people praising the show. I keep hearing that it's satire, but I've watched the entire series and not one of the episode makes any sense too me, and I'm no stranger to weird science fiction. I'm a fan of J.G. Ballard, I read a lot of William S. Burroughs when I was a kid, I'm a huge fan of Rod Serling So I guess what I'm saying is that this is less of a review, and more of a message to anyone who feels the same way I do: you are not alone. I thought I would give the British a chance, but the show was of course garbage. I do not understand why the UK finds certain concepts like this entertaining. I watched the first episode, and it was the most extremely unrealistic thing I have ever seen. I don't believe the writers of this show actually put any thought to what is plausible in the real world or stopped to ask themselves questions like, "Would this happen in real life? Is this believable? Is the British government actually this stupid or are we just writing them this way?" I continue to have little to no faith in the UK film industry, and will be shocked if I am ever presented with a good UK series. The dark humor was not funny and the concept of the show had little to no thought. Overall, I would rather have sex with a pig than watch this show. This series is just great. Season 5 gets a lot of hate, but I see where Charlie Brooker was going for. Because what is more interesting: an episode about some sort of obvious dangerous and killing piece of technology, or an episode about different aspects of technology that we already know, but just with some subtle twists or different perspectives? Episodes that don't tell you what to think, but LET you think. Episodes that don't scream "technology is awful" but tell a story about... people. People and technology. That's what season 5 delivers. So far I am zero for 4 with these episodes. This series of episodes are nothing more that the Lifetime channel being either the victim channel or stupid criminals. <br/><br/>Very disappointing and piss poor storylines.. Sorry Charlie Brooker, but this series seems as though written by an aging populace preaching resistance to change. The ideas portrayed are clear, but they only paint a one-sided perspective that's biased towards the negative, with scientific or moral dilemmas purposefully ignored or emitted to promote it, and doesn't hold up to further scrutiny. It is well executed visually, perfectly acted, shot and written, and episodes start from the right vantage point to yield maximum effect. It's with the message that I have the biggest contention; There have and always will be negative obstacles to any progress: Technology has revolutionised fraud and theft, provided new forms of bullying, sensationalism and public humiliation. But it has transformed the world enormously for the better, improving access to information, communication, commerce, increased globalisation and productivity. Such challenges breed discussion, promote awareness to decrease prevalence, and offer possible improvements to laws and regulations. As problems evolve with and because of technology, our ability to combat and prevent them evolves as well. Here are the issued I encountered for each episode (SPOLERS AHEAD): <br/><br/>1.1: This premise hinges on a man who recognises the actor brought in and posts his picture online, thus alerting the kidnapper to the deception. If such a critical and decisive operation were to take place, one would expect it would be handled with more professionalism and secrecy. The actor is walked to the entrance in the open, and the man takes the picture with no protest or rebuke before or after the incident (although the actor is 'rushed in' as if the phone was a gun. An outrageous scenario orchestrated for plot development? I think so. The Prime Minister's wife also appears to be exceedingly insecure about people's perceptions of her. One would think someone in her position would be better accustomed to sensationalism, scrutiny and disgruntled public opinion. You also wouldn't need to be in the public eye to know that comments on some websites should not be taken seriously.<br/><br/>1.2: I don't believe spending your life peddling for credits while living in confined cages under an advertising regime resembles a realistic premise, but perhaps it's not meant to be - the episode's sole purpose is to make an abstract comment about the nature of media, advertising and commercialism. As the world becomes more connected, the representation of an individual as a virtual caricature becomes more common, but only because of the nature and prevalence of such interaction. Technology is not responsible for this, human nature is. We have always objectified those furthest away from our grasp, and technology brings us closer to the same extent that it leaves us behind a barrier.<br/><br/>1.3: Is this technology wrong because of the scenario offered? Would objectifying memory cause more conflict than resolve, and signal the end of indiscretion and privacy? The answer is no, or rather no more than presently. We often recall and deliberate over our past experiences, and this technology wouldn't change that. Regarding the main story, we are presented with an impossible scenario (possibly the worst) and asked to choose between truth or privacy. If you are in a relationship where the question "Show me where you were last night?" consistently surfaces, trust issues or relationship flaws very likely exist. This is in contrast to what one would envision to be the typical application for this type of technology; Domestic disputes and crimes would be recorded just like everything else. They could be erased through force or intimidation, but it's very likely that such a system would have a backup capacity (much like Facebook does when you delete an account), so that deleting wouldn't stop the perpetrator from getting caught. This hypothetical scenario could in fact dramatically reduce the rate of crime committed, not increase it.<br/><br/>2.1: Be Right Back has a similar conundrum. This is a world where an artificial body can be grown and moulded from powder in hours (and stored with an infinite battery pack), but an artificial computer isn't able to properly mimic human reactions to emotions if it doesn't have 'sufficient data'. Contrary to what is stated, people have all types of online interactions these days that go far beyond pleasantries and encompass most of the emotional spectrum. For missing data, it wouldn't be hard for a system to calculate the best response specific to any individual for any given situation or emotion. By that time we would also have cars that drive themselves, avoiding accidents altogether. In fact, the Google driver-less car already exists. A better premise could focus on how surrogates would be treated and the legal implications of their existence.<br/><br/>2.2: If we possessed the technology to wipe away sinful memories, then this would be the most impractical use of it imaginable. Repeatedly wiping the memory of a criminal for continuous emotional torture and entertainment would be deemed highly immoral by any present or future civilisation. What would be the point of torturing someone who doesn't know what they've done wrong? The implications of memory wiping have been addressed in numerous films, notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. For criminals, it could offer a blank slate or a second chance at life. For others it could wipe away traumatic and debilitating experiences to improve quality of life. These are all moral and legal grey areas, but still offer more realistic scenarios than shown here.<br/><br/>2.3: Not much to be said here. Could the team behind a satirical blue bear ever be approved to run for public office? The answer is no.<br/><br/>Constructing incomplete, cynical and misleading scenarios that only work to spread fear is simply pointless and counter-productive. A superior show would examine both sides and predict the future more accurately. A more pressing threat (possibly worth being a little paranoid about) is artificial intelligence, but this far exceeds the scope of this series- clearly this isn't the programme to watch if you're looking to educate yourself about science and technology. I'm pi***d beyond words, so much that I made this account solely to review what I just wasted my time on. I'm not here for trolling purposes, if I give this show 1 out of 10 it's not because I'm a troll or because I didn't understand it, but because this show does not deserve a rating of anything above 5. Now let me tell you about my bad experience with this show. After reading tonnes of good reviews about this show I decided to watch it, but now I can say I can never trust show reviews again. Majority of people have really bad taste in shows and they screw up the rest of the people with a working brain. There is nothing decent about this show, it is not unique, it does not force you to think about things deeply(unless you have an IQ in double digits) and it might be the most boring show you'll ever come across that's rated close to 9 on IMDb. Every episode has a different story and the episodes aren't interconnected, all episodes are bad and kill your time in the worst possible way. What's worth noticing is that the second episode managed to get worse than the first one and I almost slept midway, but I didn't miss anything because there was nothing worth watching about it. Please don't take this show's ratings seriously and give it a miss. Well, I have to admit, I've swallowed it, alright... But when I've got through those two seasons, I felt something odd - why do I have the feeling that this artsy, independently presented thing seems to have a hell of a budget for the special effects department, and why do 90% of the episodes ramble about TV shows or the likes ? Hm. And then I watched the credits - what a surprise !!! Pure, black mirrory irony: the producer of this show is Endemol - pretty much THE production company worldwide who entertains or should I say renders people completely stupid in front of their TV set with exactly the type of shows criticized along the Black Mirror Episodes. Wow. Now you can call me paranoid or a conspiracy addict, but that seems like a perfect marketing strategy to me: Depict those shows, which would eventually come up next, a little irony here, a bit of voyeurism there, see which one pays off in the audience and the forums and here we go for the next-gen batch of stupid game and reality shows. I must say, the best scenario definitely goes to Endemol's think tank. Bravo. I'm so disappointed by season 5. I see the points they were making and they really could've been far more powerful had the stories not been weak. The first episode about the video games was actually the only one that was mildly entertaining for me. It lost me in some instances but it did manage to keep my attention longer than the next two. The second one was a mess, when the big reveal happens of why the big tragedy happened I couldn't help but chuckle. I know, I know, the point was to make the reason as ridiculous as possible so we see the danger in social media addiction but this story was told in such a goofy manner, you had to laugh... like ok ?<br/><br/>The third episode was silly. Which is unfortunate because, again, there was a strong point it was trying to make - a point I very much agree with it. The story was no help at all. I think this one could've been better without the two girls. They were mostly annoying as the episode progressed and you realize they're just convenient plot devices ... you can and always have done better than that Black Mirror.<br/><br/>So disappointed and hope they get back to their roots for season 6. Let's pretend season 5 never happened. My brother put me on to this show. The latest season is the best one yet. Great show especially if you're a sci-fi tech fan. This is a refreshing unique take on human obsessions in the 21st century and how it damages us to a degree . I like the different aspects of how we are shown and in a way warned about our current obsession with technology so take heed of warning to your own use of out so called necessities of today's digital world . I found this series extraordinary. It made me feel like I did very young when seeing The Twilight Zone for the first time...a world like ours, but tilted slightly, an engaging story and often a twist at the end. Should you find the subject matter the first episode to be a bit too much, I would suggest skipping it. However, it is a terrific episode and well worth viewing. All of the stories include a tweak in the current world, often in the nature of technology. Be Back Soon has elements of romance to it, while other episodes are more thriller or political in nature. They all belong together but each have their own feel. There are cameos by characters in one episode in others, but it's done as a fun thing to spot, not meant to illuminate the stores, which is why this is definitely episodic in nature. Highly recommended. This show is the definition of the kind of thinking I disapprove. <br/><br/>It is known that human is afraid of change. Although, every time something new is invented in our society, a group of pessimist have the awful tendency to see new as bad. When cinema was invented, society was afraid movies were going to mess with the reality in people's head. When the pill was invented, everyone thought it was going to ruin relationship between men and women, saying goodbye to monogamy. Society thought women were going to become "sluts" and that sex would become this unhealthy, devalued thing. So know there's social network, dating apps, augmented reality and TV shows. Guess what people think about this new stuff ? Black Mirror. What an easy thinking way. Black mirror is the opposite of forward thinking. It just shows the pessimist's view of new inventions when there is a lot of up sides to them. Plus, the fact that thinking that people are not capable of choosing the impact of technology on them is just like saying free will doesn't exist. What a great vision of humans. Like most modern British shows - *cough*DrWho*cough* - it's a vehicle for pushing an anti-white, anti-male agenda. Nearly every relationship will be mixed-race, the cast is hyper "diverse" far beyond the actual proportions of Britain (for now), every stupid/evil character will be a white male. Sure, there are some women who do "bad" things, but they are very nuanced, with lots of back story and context; "How did she get to this point? What pushed her to this?" White, male villains will be cartoonishly one-dimensional and just presented as-is; "And then there's this putrid piece of filth... You know he's evil incarnate, because he's a white male." Other than that, it's basically a modern twist on Twilight Zone with a focus on not-too-distant future technology. Each episode is its own universe and stands alone in this anthology. I'm only in the first season (I've seen other reviewers claim later seasons take a nosedive), but so far, if you are immune from being preached at by social "justice" with all the subtlety of a 2x4 to the head, the stories are fairly interesting. I have to say, that I am very, very impressed with this show, or better said ... masterpiece. <br/><br/>Every part has its own story, but all of them are showing the negative consequences of technology and consequently people turning into "sheep". It is a unique show, and I don't think everybody will find it bearable. Some of the scenes are slightly perverted and quite radical. Second part is my favorite in each season. All stories are very deep and hold a lot of meanings. They are often futuristic, with some very great, advanced ideas. They criticize modern society, where technology has a big part in an everyday life. Also, I liked very much, that some stories often reveal their true meaning toward the end, so you get this "mind blown" effect. <br/><br/>I urge you to watch this brilliant show and then think deeper about our society and the future, that awaits us. Charlie Brooker is a great satirist: funny and clever, and, although often crude, in 'Black Mirror' he certainly isn't pandering to the lowest common denominator (in spite of the fact that the first film is about the prime minister having sex with a pig!). Indeed, he (and his collaborators) show themselves to be skilled film-makers: in this trio of short stories about how technology is changing our lives, two have a sci-fi feels and the understated way with which a future world, subtly different to our own, is conveyed, with a minimum of carefully deployed special effects, is a lesson to Hollywood with its obsession with spectacle and its inability to understand that less can be more. Yet while Brooker's films are delicately made, there's a certain obviousness to the points he is making; while he's extraordinarily skillful in imagining the details, there's less below the surface than you might hope for. I found the middle film the most convincing (and indeed moving), and exactly because it was most explicitly a fable; in the others, Brooker's merciless eye is also not a little heartless. But Brooker deserves credit for not standing still, and settling for making new series of 'Screenburn' ad infinitum; 'Black Mirror' may only be a partial success, but it's bold and fresh and worth watching, even if it's not so much deeper than the world it's taking apart. Perhaps the intern who has to write the synopsis for Netflix didn't quite know what to make of this series or, perhaps, just the pilot episode, but pilot shows as this one don't get green-lighted; yet this one somehow did. A better show would have been to explain how THAT happened.<br/><br/>A review of this episode: the English princess is kidnapped after her too-small-to-handle-the-job security detail is overrun by one man, apparently. A ransom demand requires that the prime minister have sexual intercourse with a pig on national television, which he initially refuses to do. After a twit on the PM's staff arranges for a fake video to be created, the kidnapper somehow gets wise to this and sends a finger, alleged to be the princess', to a television station, which has been the focus of a subplot involving sexting and the leaking of information by a PM staffer. Some cybercrime specialist determines where the ransom video was uploaded. Surprise! The location was a waste of time and the television station's reporter is shot at the scene. Eventually, the PM does the deed, the people shake their collective heads in insincere regret while leering at their screens, his wife is humiliated, the princess stumbles out onto a bridge –– unharmed, and the kidnapper hangs himself. Okay?<br/><br/>The thing that irritates me about shows like this –– after having watched enough seasons of "24" –– is that they are so predictable and so avoidable. After the PM does his porcine performance, the finger's DNA results shows it was from a male, of course! And, of course! no effort was made to ensure that the kidnapper would ever honor his demand. Did anyone question why the royal family was not involved in this? The writing is amateurish and seemingly motivated by nothing more than sophomoric pretensions. No effort is made to explain the events or give meaning to any aspect of the story except as a most puerile of "wouldn't this be cool?" scenarios in the writer's room. Such logic is also often behind the thought process of bad tattoos.<br/><br/>To compare this dreck to "The Twilight Zone" is an insult to Rod Serling and his superior talent as the creator of the best show on television. To call "Black Mirror" "science fiction" is a misnomer at least for this episode. I will watch at least one more episode just to see if there is any hope. Sometimes if you dig in the shite long enough you may find a quid.<br/><br/>**Of "special" note: I like how this show threw around the coarse language in verbal and written form, but IMDb seems a bit prudish in the same –– even if it's their own spelling suggestion!** I had not even heard of "Black Mirror" before I was recommended to watch it at the local place where I usually make most of my movie purchases, given the usual stuff that I purchase there. So I went home and started season 1 as it was available on Netflix.<br/><br/>I managed to endure almost 3 episodes of the first season before I gave up. I will say that it was refreshing for a series to have each and every episode to be independent of one another, that each was a self-contained and complete story in itself. So you could essentially sit down to watch them in any random order. I managed to get almost through the third episode of season 1 before I gave up.<br/><br/>It turned out, that despite each episode being very well produced and also having some interesting concept behind it, that the premise of the series was just not appealing to me. Why? Well, because I am not really all that interested in technology.<br/><br/>The acting in the three episodes that I watched was good, and it was nice enough to see story lines poke fun at things that are wrong with society today, such as how desperate for fame people are that they are willing to participate in "talent" shows, or the fact that most of our lives are spent online in one way or another, etc.<br/><br/>I guess that "Black Mirror" would have a wide appeal, and at first glance it seems like it is something that might slip under the radar of most people. I, for example, hadn't even heard about it prior to being recommended to watch it. Just finished the second episode, and I have to say that this probably is the worst series I have ever seen. It is the first series I have watched that got me SERIOUSLY frustrated. It is extremely incoherent, the episodes has nothing to do with each other. Also the events and situations are so far fetched, it is as if the writer were retarded or something. The different episodes are also uneventful, numb and has quite poor effects/acting. Do not watch this piece of crap, use your time on something else please.<br/><br/>DO NOT WATCH!<br/><br/>/Alex It's time to take a look in the mirror yourself. Season 5 episode 1 rates 6 stars. Episode 2 what a weak boring plot. Episode 3 really?<br/><br/>Where did the money go? Instead of developing a good season you gave it all to a C-class actor who sings?! Season 1 to 4 is one of the most creative, innovative shows of all time. Season 5 is a downhill with no creativity at all and weak story line. This is truly an amazing show. At this point I have watched the first three episodes and have been brought to tears by each one. The issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. Nothing but an infantile exercise in satire. Dark mirror is for Satire what Facebook is for friendship. Here's the problem with Dark Mirror - The world they are satirising, Youth mass media/social media, doesn't need satirising. It's already satire!<br/><br/>The pilot is beyond ludicrous and plausibility. Everybody in charge is an idiot and the filmmakers treat the viewers as such - conveniently glossing over glaring logic flaws and asking the viewer to suspend basic assumptions like cheating us into believing a cut off man's finger is that of a dainty princess. <br/><br/>It's really lazy writing and the show continually asks us to suspend our disbelief beyond for even the most basic of plot points. It would be okay if they cut a few corners to get the message across but the whole thing is an exercise in cutting every corner just to get across a few insipid dark views on the modern world. Like I said, watching real life is more satirical than this. <br/><br/>I did watch the 2nd episode in the hopes that it would get better, but unfortunately it didn't. It was just as silly. It's obvious that Charlie Brooker thinks young people into Talent Shows and Facebook are morons, but a good satire needs to be more than pointing out the obvious. It needs to be more than getting a giant brush and pairing it with random thoughts about the modern age. A good story and something more insightful than a twitter post by a professional sports player would be a good place to start for a show like this. As it stands now it's nothing more than a shallow observation by somebody who thinks they are being clever and nobody has the heart to tell them otherwise.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just watched the 3rd episode. It's actually interesting because it deals with human relationships and emotions in a grounded way. It does pull a few sneaky tricks, but overall it's much better than the 1st and 2nd episode. Although the resolution adds nothing and doesn't live up to the build up. Charlie Booker is a good (maybe great) comedy writer. He's not good at dystopian fiction. A lot of good actors in these episodes and the series really swings for the fence, but it's a strikeout. The ideas are thin, the dialog is wooden and the concepts are pretty lightweight and at the same time, pretty repulsive. Sort of a "Idiocracy" feel to the series, with the current state of affairs brought to some sort of futuristic territories, but no humor and very little to recommend it. I watched the first one, the one about the return of the dead thru software, the one about the special Disney punishment village and the one about the "American Idol"/Hunger Games kind of TV show, with the avatars and all that. None of them really any good, and a pity to see Mike Smiley and some of the characters from the Thick of It wasted in this. I spose they enjoyed the paycheck best show i've ever seen<br/><br/>So funny to read reviews of people who Hated it... all of them say something like "I watched the 1st episode and...bla bla"...indeed the 1st episode is the most scandalous of them all...maybe that's why they made it episode 1? If you don't like this, this show isn't for you...go watch breaking bad or something Incredible- I mean I simply couldn't believe it at all. How come this lame TV series gets this much rating that I don't understand because I couldn't watch more than one episode of the show.<br/><br/>Granted I only watched the first episode but what an episode! It was an insult to my intelligent. The prime minister was manipulated in this episode. But the way he get manipulated was lame beyond explanation. Probably writer never saw a president or how he works, have no idea how the operations goes around him; he just used his weak imagination. <br/><br/>There so many things that are wrong with the episode, it will take at least ten pages to write it all. So I will not go into all that. All I want to let the people know who are thinking of watching the series are that; the acting was unconvincing (actors and actresses completely failed to grasp the gravity of the scenes), there was no logic in the story(this is not how the government deals with blackmailers) and it will be a utter waste of your valuable time.<br/><br/>HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED. There is nothing new or shocking about this show. If it were truly that original and the man had that much of a imagination, there would be a season of 21 plus episodes like any show worth its salt out there. But no. There is a reason there are only three episodes in the first series. Yep, three boring, over long episodes.<br/><br/>Episode 1 A future prime minister is forced to have sex with a pig.<br/><br/>Epispde 2 People ride indoor cycle machines in exchange for credit to "live"<br/><br/>Episode 3 We have devices in out heads that record all events as we live them, and can play them back.<br/><br/>To be honest i was so bored by the end of each episode i knew that the only reason i was watching them, was to write a review here!. Watched first episode of the series and found it to be one of the most vile, disgusting and disturbing things I've ever seen. As bad as "Caligula" and "Salo" w/o being explicit.<br/><br/>To what end? We don't already know that the collision of 24/7 media and fickle public opinion leads to terrible situations and political chaos? That we can't turn away from watching horrifying world events? Who doesn't know that already? I embrace plenty of "disturbing" movies and TV shows when the ideas and themes enlighten on some level; but this was just the worst!! Maybe the other episodes are better, but I don't intend to find out. absolutely gripping intelligent humorous insight into modern culture with a media savi team of writers.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch for the will he won't he suspense of the first episode.<br/><br/>make some time in your schedule to see this and look forward to discussing it with people afterwards.<br/><br/>Looking forward to this writing team coming back with more funds to deliver bigger and better.<br/><br/>the ten lines of text minimum is a real pain when you are in a hurry to watch the next episode.<br/><br/>enjoy. Starts with a good episode followed by two utter rubbish episodes.. <br/><br/>The first episode is edgy and controversial, but the second and third are the absolute opposite and not worth the time. I had so many people tell me that I would really like this series. So I bought the dvd box from the UK, and started watching.
"The National Anthem" was one of the most ridiculously absurd crapfests I've ever seen. There are so many things wrong with the whole kidnapping story that it beggars belief. This would never happen under any circumstances. The denouement made the set-up a bad joke. And the finger??? Nobody could tell a workingman's finger from some dainty "princess" digit? It beggars belief.
I'm throwing the box set in the trash.
Don't waste one second of your life on this. Don't waste your time! My husband and I just watched the first episode of Black Mirror. It caught my attention as it was described as "in the vein of 'The Twilight Zone'" on Netflix. This show should in NO way be compared to the creative talent of Rod Serling. The show was extremely cruel and crude and did not show any signs of the creative talent displayed in the series "The Twilight Zone". This is 43 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I will not be back to view any further episodes of this series. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID.....apparently reviews must be 10 lines in length to be published......hence the reason for this last line. I hope this review saves others from a terrible show. Incredible show seasons 1 through 4 were amazing season 5 was herorific Black mirror has a unique vibe in its episodes. I really, really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. Season 4 had some great episodes, also some less entertaining episodes. But season 5 doesn't feel like black mirror at all. It seems like the technological dystopia that every great episode had, was not recognized in season 5. It felt more like 3 short mainstream films to me. Season 5 just wasn't dark enough and it was too expectable. The acting is good don't get me wrong, but the stories in the fifth season aren't like they were in seasons past. Seasons 1-4 a solid 9, season five a 6, but in terms of relevance to black mirror, I wouldn't even rate it. As a Black Mirror Major Fan I long awaited season 5. One the best shows on cable with only a few sub par episodes. Smithereens is not one of them it is one of the best Mirrors ever. Andrew Scott our favorite from Mystery was outstanding. Edge of the seat with emotional depth and a dig on Facebook to boot. I know if your a Mirror Fan you don't need to read this to the others just start with this one and you will be back for more. Rich So I've seen a lot of the episodes. The strength of the series is definitely the ability to take aspects of modern life and spin them to their logical extremes to make a point. So, for example, you take a world that shares and rates every aspect of our lives on social networks and imagine a world where those networks aren't just harmless wastes of time but can actually impact your ability to get a job or find a place to live. Or you look at our modern democratic system that constantly monitors public opinion to make policy and imagine a situation where a politician must do truly disgusting things to appease the masses, even at the expense of their dignity and family.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with these ideas; science fiction has a long and storied history of critiquing society to point out potential issues and moral hazards. The problem I do have is the way the stories wind down and the conclusions they draw. Almost without exception the conclusions are bleak. Characters never make the right choices or even if they do they are inevitably crushed by the systems they rebel against.<br/><br/>If you think of these stories as little horror movies, it's the point at the end of the film where the survivors either get to walk away having experienced something horrible but having survived and learned a little bit about themselves along the way, or they all get slaughtered and the last scene is the final survivor being pulled back down into the darkness by the monster and the camera panning twenty feet over to the safety they almost reached.<br/><br/>Both types of endings have their place. But when you choose to use only one of them the negativity starts to get a bit stifling. There has to be hope sometimes or it just feels depressing and pessimistic. I suppose this may just be a personal thing, others may not mind the continuously bleak outlook, but for me it gets really hard to watch more than one or two of these in a month.<br/><br/>The acting is usually pretty decent, as are the production values. The writing is also usually quite decent, although they often stretch logic to the breaking point to get the ending they envision. I guess this would be a mini spoiler warning, but there is one episode where a sophisticated device malfunctions to lethal effect because of interference from a common, everyday piece of personal electronics, the equivalent of a commercial airliner hurtling into the ground because you didn't turn your cell phone off. To call that absurd doesn't really even begin to cover it; it could never happen.<br/><br/>So in the end, my feelings about the show are rather mixed. To some degree I really like the creativity of the concepts and the decent execution, but on the other hand I find myself feeling rather depressed by the constant negativity and a little irritated that I can usually guess how the story will end half way thru because it is always the most bleak ending that they run with. This show is the most interesting series I have come across. Black mirror presents scenarios which seem like a natural progression for the trends in the world, and also for potential trends which our society is already gravitating toward, in a way that shows you the benefits but focuses more on the potential negatives which seem to elude us. I applaud the foresight of the writers who present these issues in a way that seems obvious while were watching each episode but probably have not pondered in our every day lives. This show overall seems to have the underlying message that we want all these things which we believe will better out lives but comes with a set of problems which ultimately doesn't change anything. I believe this show is meant to help us appreciate the simpler things in life or at the very least challenge the wants we believe are the most important. Either way, a very interesting show and I would recommend everyone to watch it. This show is like Coldplay. Once, innovative and emotional. Now, commercial and a poor reflection of itself. 
Charlie Brooker who writes this show is a genius. And in the past he has been utterly brutal and rude about the machinations of the media. So it is very ironic that his show, which was once radical and avant garde has now been bummed into PC servitude and half-baked nonsense by Hollywood. 
Black Mirror is dead. All hail Black Mirror, as reinterpreted by left wing Hollywood PC liberalists. The beautiful cynicism has been replace by political messages, wrapped up in interesting-ish plots. The sharp plots have been replaced with by the numbers chase scenes and clangingly obvious 'twists'. 
It is so obvious that the original scripts and ideas have been savaged by people with agendas beyond making great TV. That Netflix has decided to dilute what made it great and instead is trading on borrowed time - the first two seasons when it wasn't on Netflix. 
Oh well, the first series is still awesome. Despite the title suggests cynicism, there was no warning given to the audience prior to the show.<br/><br/>It was sick. The filming itself was good but i still give it 1 point out of 10 because at least it should have contained a warning that this episode (episode 1, season 1) may make people uncomfortable. <br/><br/>IMHO the *reality* "Black Mirror" is that the show received a 8.9 score on IMDb. I am reminded that poignant and critical science fiction still holds a place in our society. No matter how advanced our world becomes I hope someone will always be holding a magnifying glass up to the people and technology that shape out daily lives. In the vein of Rod Serlings Twilight Zone, Black Mirror shows us a bleak impression of the future if we succumb to the immediate gratification of technology and cynicism. Each Black Mirror episode is it's own stand alone piece. I'm not going to do a breakdown of the episodes. They are all worth checking out. Just trust me when I say it's some of the best Sci-Fi I've seen in a long, long time. REAL Sci-Fi. There aren't any happy endings here. It's Beautiful, It's sad, and it's all probably going to happen.<br/><br/>Watch it, enjoy it, and be wary of the future. I can't understand why this show has such a high rating. I've long come to not be able to trust IMDb review ratings. I noticed that most of the 8-9 star reviews are from outside of my home country of the U.S. Many things don't always translate across borders, so I can say those reviews are wrong or bad. <br/><br/>I can only speak from my perspective of being an older American male who grew up on the original Twilight Zone TV series. From my perspective, Black Mirror is slow, boring, and it is an insult to the original TZ show to have this show compared to it. The TZ made clear points by usually having a discovery twist at the end of the episode. I don't believe this show comes anywhere close to that. <br/><br/>Black Mirror is not something I'm going to do what I consider to be wasting my time watching. I tried to watch a few episodes from the different seasons, but It's just not a very good show in my opinion. "At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul." -credits to Billy Madison. They really hit the nail on the head with this. I tried two episodes and doing literally anything else would have been better. Scratching my ass for an hour would have been a better use of time. It fathoms me how this show received so many high reviews and ratings. By all means just save yourself the anguish and just take a pass on this one. You've been warned! The first story was sick. I have to admit it is something I never thought of, and now it's out there for some scumbag to duplicate. Honestly, the first story was enough for me. We took it off our watch list for good. What was really disturbing was how the show explored the "so gross I couldn't look away" theory. The problem is you can't un-see something. Once you watch, it becomes a part of you, and that is something people should think deeply about. Do you really want to pollute your mind with some of this trash? I usually love these kinds of series. I am an avid fan of everything from The twilight Zone to Tales from the Darkside and even Stranger Things. However, I barely made it through one episode of this. The plot was boring, the acting was uninspired. The episode I watched had english speaking actors/actresses I could barely make out any of what they were saying. Not to mention the soft porn images and sex scenes that were constantly shown throughout the entire episode was in very bad taste. 
I am no stranger to controversial movies and shocking shows or even sex in movies. Hell I was raised in the 80's when movies and shows were alot more shocking and controversial then what we have today.<br/><br/>However, I was both disgusted and mortified by what I saw in this show. In the end, I found the whole story to be so pointless and stupid that the gratuitous porn just seemed even more outrageous to me. It seems like when they made this show they underestimated our intelligence as viewers and decided that by putting this filth together they could pass it off to us as "entertainment". Personally I did not find any of it even remotely entertaining. I can recommend Stranger Things but as for this show, you might want to pass. Knowing Charlie Brooker I expected cynical, dark and dare I say it mildly thought provoking.. Unfortunately 'Black Mirror: The National Anthem' is heinously cynical, dark and seriously trashy. Hence I feel this equally negative review should counteract Charlie Brooker's remorseless portrayal of humankind. From the off, the only character I sympathise with is the prime minister's aid, questioning the plausibility of the princess' unconvincing dramatics. The poor acting and constant spelling out of every potential nuance of the plot unearths the already questionable storyline as the short lived teenage horror film it is. Masquerading as a contemplative assessment of modern media, in reality only to be enjoyed by giggling fifteen year olds indulging themselves in the tasteless ridiculousness of this pretence of grandeur. The 2 stars is for the first episode which was very good. <br/><br/>All others were so dull and predictable it could have been written by a 13 year old who had only lived through watching rubbish on on the internet and had nil experience of life.<br/><br/>And no, that doesn't make it good, or insightful, it makes it dull and lazy and for people with the attention span of advert land. <br/><br/>Brooker, a horribly overrated journo in a crass and anti-working-class rag in England, try looking at meaningfully good content like the stuff Chris Morris can do then weep for your truly woeful lack of talent.<br/><br/>Maybe the LA air's got to his head and it's stuck completely up his posterior...darling, so fabulous, what a genius...ahhhh I enjoyed watching the show. First episode open so strong and different. Obviously with a few complaints like with anything. But by he time you get to the end you realize you wasted your time and thank god you didn't watch it sober. Has nothing to do with technology. It's just about twitter being annoying. Which ruins he fabulous writing. Like asking Picasso to paint your Mum... pointless and a waste of time for a genius. Yes I know maybe 3 of them aren't about twitter. And some have good story lines up until you go, oh it's about twitter again. If this show makes you question your beliefs in society. Then your a moron to begin with. But if you just enjoy its cos colours on the TV. Then good enough. Seriously let down by Charlie. But I know he doesn't care (good for him). Will watch the next series probably but if it's just about having a futuristic version of google glass on you at all times I'll probably be disappointed. Don't worry I'm British and love a good disappointment. I would recommend Philip k dicks electric dreams over this, which gets worse reviews. But you have no idea what happened in that show. And that makes you think about everything and anything. And Not just about how twitter might be bad. Episode two is the most profound artistic statement I've ever seen on any medium. The monologue by the dude at the end is probably the best bit of acting I've ever seen. Next level S#!t. I was going to leave this review at that but IMDb says it must be a minimum of 10 lines. All I can say is this show is truly visionary and probably too far ahead of it's time for a lot of people to really appreciate. People who are looking for something new, unique, interesting, thought provoking, disturbing, intelligent, spectacular, sensational, prophetic, well executed, superbly written, directed, and performed, will enjoy this program. The first episode was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen on film, but was so well done and engaging I couldn't look away... or sleep afterward. The second episode just takes filmmaking to a whole new level. The third episode doesn't let up and is brilliant in it's own way. I haven't gotten to the second season yet, but I've seen enough to easily give it ten stars. This ridiculously short series is brilliant. There are three episodes, each a bleak and dark story about how the modern, internet and technology filled world could plunge us into hell. The first, is one set in the present. What is so fantastic, is that it is something that could happen tomorrow. The fictional princess is kidnapped by an unknown person and a video ransom is posted anonymously on YouTube bizarrely saying that unless the (fictional) prime minister had sexual intercourse with a pig live broadcast on every British television channel in four days, she would be killed. The story is gripping, the actors are brilliant and realistic, and the episode is also fabulously directed, adding in little things such as over the course of the four days the prime minister's hair seems to thin out of stress of knowing what he must do. This episode certainly shows you just how terrible the internet could be if it gets into the wrong and powerful hands. <br/><br/>The next episode is one about a hopefully-far future, where everything is commercial and false, and everybody is trapped and must play games to make false money to spend on false objects. They feed out of fake food-dispensing machines, which gives out fake, packaged fruit. It is an entirely commercial world, and there appears to be no outside. It shows two attempts to escape from the drag that life has become, each working, to an extent, before it becomes just as fake and dull as before. The way this is done is by going on an exaggerated, satire of a talent show and winning it. It features a lot of references to how people take the Nintendo Wii and gaming seriously, internet advertising and how wrong it seems and talent contests and how much they are a scam. A lot less realistic, yet again it is thoroughly entertaining and makes you think about how that could be where the world is going. The animation and product design is fantastic and so realistic. This episode also casts Julia Davis and Rupert Everett as the evil talent show judges who both do brilliant acting. <br/><br/>The third is a dark 'love' story set in the near-future about how wrong it could be if people could re-watch their memories and show others. People seem to be forced to have small chips implanted behind their ears so their vision is being recorded and can be played back on any screen using a small tool and a super-fast, Wi Fi that is everywhere. It's idea is that people could become obsessed with the past and search their memories for tiny details, eventually causing insanity and a bad ending. It follows a man who obsesses over the behaviour of his girlfriend at a party the last night and the idea that she is having an affair with a man he clearly hates who was at the party. It (very psychologically) goes through him trying to find out whether she is having an affair or not, and eventually completely loosing it and using the memory-viewer, proves that she is. The 'proof' though, is never revealed to be completely genuine. In the end, he realises his life has been ruined by the memory-viewer, so, using a blade and tweezers, cuts out the memory-viewing chip. The product design and effects were the best yet, the chips behind the ears and the creepy way in which when people view their memories their eyes glow a dead white, which adds to the foreboding and tense atmosphere. <br/><br/>I never knew how intelligent Charlie Brooker was until I saw this. Utterly phenomenal. I have never seen anything like this on Channel 4 and certainly recommend it to anyone who is open to wacky ideas and darker subjects.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading. Before watching, I read a handful of reviews for this series and wowed at the high overall rating of 8.8.<br/><br/>Now, let's get this in perspective...<br/><br/>A higher rating than:  Halt and Catch Fire (2014)...?!  Hand of God (2014)...?!  Bates Motel (2013)...?!  Manhattan (2014)...?!<br/><br/>NO WAY! ...and this is the problem!<br/><br/>I watched the first two episodes of "Black Mirror". I was horrified and stupefied by the first "The National Anthem" and bored senseless with the second "Fifteen Million Merits".<br/><br/>Whoever wrote "The National Anthem" needs his head examined. Apart from the fact that I'm not keen on Rory Kinnear, I say this for two reasons:<br/><br/>i. It was a totally unnecessary, disgusting and vile piece of writing. The writer must have been seriously short of idea to resort to something like this. Now, I'm not a prude but this could easily have been focused on a 'safer' topic that would get the same 'point' across (whatever that point was supposed to be).<br/><br/>ii. It was completely and utterly unbelievable. Does anyone REALLY believe that a Prime Minister would resort to 'obeying' the demands of a kidnapper in such a way??? It wouldn't happen. I repeat: IT... WOULD... NOT...HAPPEN...! The repercussions of this would affect the country considerably more than the loss of one life (and by saying this I'm not trivialising life). Over the years, the knock-on negative effect for ANY subsequent Government would be phenomenal. Politics would be changed forever and the general population would have such a deep loss of self-respect that I believe the people would resort to some form of anarchic behaviour including, in some cases, self-destruction. There is no Government on Earth that would submissively resort to such action.<br/><br/>As for "Fifteen Million Merits", it was a very nice idea, a great concept but... Alfred Hitchcock could have gotten the point across in a 20 minutes AND make a better job of it.<br/><br/>I'll give this one more chance by watching the episode "White Christmas" which, I notice, has specifically been given wonderful reviews.<br/><br/>However, judging by my first and second incursions into this series, I would recommend staying well away. Instead, try watching "The Outer Limits"... same idea but HUGELY better! Black mirror has all the makings of something I would greatly enjoy: Bleak, dystopian sci-fi with societal relevance, alongside being the brainchild of Charlie Brooker, whose show Screenwipe I am a fan of. Additionally, the acting is generally good, with some variance (as you would expect with a fresh cast for each episode), while direction, cinematography and editing is on the whole quite excellent. The dialogue usually does its job well. And I had no problems with Black Mirror being harsh and somewhat brutal, I thought that aspect of it worked nicely. In fact, an underdog grim reality sci-fi tale against a sea of commercial feelgoodery is easy to root for.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I didn't really like Black Mirror. I didn't hate it, but I enjoyed it far less than I had imagined. At first I couldn't quite put my finger on why, considering all the positives. After mulling it over I found the answer interesting enough to jot down - if nothing else, to see if I'm alone in feeling this way about it, or if it resonates with anyone.<br/><br/>I'll go into the two main reasons, as mentioned in the title (I will use some examples from the first season and the Christmas special, so only read on if you don't mind spoilers from those episodes). First up:<br/><br/>Inconsistent world: Obviously, a good sci-fi yarn can, and should, make up its own rules about how its universe works. However, it needs to be consistent within those rules. In Black Mirror's case, its setup is a dystopian near/parallel future, in which new technology is ruining human interaction in different ways. Its tone is realistic, and treats its characters the way a social drama would, and not in the way of, say, a larger than life action-adventure.<br/><br/>In such a setting, individual and societal action need to make as much sense as it does in our own. However, Black Mirror is written in a way that forces points to come across, while sacrificing believability in its world. Some examples (out of many):<br/><br/>In the Christmas special, one of the main characters gets out of jail time by going free, but instead being "blocked" by every living person (you can't see or hear any other person). In NO world would this be a lesser punishment than going to jail. At least there you would have some social contact. (by the way, how would he even shop for food? Or do any kind of work?). Additionally, if everyone could just block anyone and it's instantly legal, with a restraining order to boot, the world would be in chaos. And yet another point: The other main character who gets blocked by his girlfriend seems oblivious to the fact that he can easily seek legal help for getting joint custody of his believed daughter, as there was absolutely no reason for him not to have a right to see her. In which case he would quickly have discovered the truth.<br/><br/>In the second episode of the first season, the female protagonist is tricked into joining the porn industry, on a live television show. It is done so brutally and tactlessly that, the horrors of reality shows aside, no human audience would accept this sort behaviour (it would at a minimum be devastating for the show's ratings). An audience cheering for this event would be so removed from the ethics of our time that they do not resonate at all, and the scene falls flat.<br/><br/>These kinds of inconsistencies within its own premise would, however, be much more forgivable, were they not compounded by the second problem:<br/><br/>Unrelatable characters: In almost all of the episodes, the protagonist is painted as someone who falls victim to technology's trappings, and the idea seems to be that without the technology, the protagonist would not end up in the same situation. This is not to say that the protagonists are painted as sympathetic, by any means - but ultimately, the tech seems to take the brunt of the blame for the transpiring events. However, many of the characters seemed to me to be irredeemably malicious on their own, and the tech did nothing other than make it somewhat easier for them to indulge themselves. For example: <br/><br/>In the third episode of the first season - which is the best of the lot - our protagonist is jealous of his wife to a violent degree, and would obviously also be so without the memory tech. I didn't feel any empathy for him at all, as his character was, in my eyes, completely irredeemable. Thus, the message became "bad man is violent and bad things happen" rather than the intended "too much technology in society can be a burden".<br/><br/>This problem doesn't limit itself to main characters: In the Christmas episode, two seemingly ordinary officers snicker as they offhandedly expose a soul to thousands of years of mental torture. That's not technology gone mad, that's two individuals completely devoid of empathy. Now, the idea put forward may be that technology would gradually change everyone's nature to become like this - but that's the whole "video games make kids violent"-argument all over again, which is boring and merit-less. The tendencies need to be there already, all technology can do is exacerbate them somewhat.<br/><br/>In closing: All in all it is a pity that these issues clouded Black Mirror for my part - however, as I mentioned there are many other good qualities to this show, and others who aren't quite as nit-picky with regards to tonality, or simply don't agree that this problem is even there, may find it to be quite a rewarding sci-fi-experience. really a 4/10 but had to give it 1/10 because its getting overrated.<br/><br/>The series tries, keyword TRIES to be like twilight zone. Granted twilight zone feels a bit dated.<br/><br/>the reboot of twilight zone had episodes that were better than this. <br/><br/>It's always funny how Television will take an old idea and introduce again and people will gawk and praise as "some revolutionary idea!"<br/><br/>the show puts a new techno spin on the old twilight stories. Some of the episodes are good but most are mediocre. <br/><br/>None and I mean NONE of the Black mirror episodes are as good as Twilight Zone's "Nothing in Dark".<br/><br/>If you expect the caliber of "Time enough at Last" you will be deeply disappointed. Each episode maybe good if ended in 5-8 minutes, anything above that is torture. This is a proper series for those young millennials who think they are smart. Acting is horrible, as if they are checking the good actor in each episode. Please, avoid this and don't ever try to suggest to a genuine series or movie lover. As an American I feel comfortable saying that this show needs to stay British. No one and I mean no one does television as well as the Brits and that goes for us Yanks...especially us actually. American TV is shallow, boring and worst of all highly predictable. Which is why I've turned to British drama! Its also fun to see every guest star or recurring actor on Game of Thrones has been recycled in literally every British TV show ever!<br/><br/>But honestly with Brit TV, the acting is downright inspirational, the writing keeps me on the edge of my seat! Black Mirror is one of those series. I had no idea what it was about when i started it other than it was British drama and i was looking for another series to binge. From episode one National Anthem..my mind was completely blown. I was shocked, horrified, and terrified at how believable these outrageous stories were.<br/><br/>My favorite brit actors of course wow'd me.<br/><br/>Black Mirror feels like The Twilight Zone for now! At least the first two seasons do.<br/><br/>So far im one episode in on the 3rd season and already I'm bummed out. They've gone American. and already its trash. for Godsake Rashida Jones is credited with writing the opening episode of season 3. And it was as boring and predictable as you would expect American TV to be. I had to force myself to get through the episode and not simply skip it altogether.<br/><br/>Anyway KEEP British TV...British!!! Not everything needs to be Americanized. Black mirror failed to impress me. Firstly because its actually very average.
I had only seen the first two episodes of the series and the first was overrated but the better of the two. The second was plain boring and dragging. Series is based on old sci-fi concept that a lot of earlier people didnt give much of care to make anything out of so these people made something out of it and its horrible. <br/><br/>Black mirror never made me think about it after watching it. Fail.<br/><br/>English movies and TV are on a decline. Content, Character and innovation are on a decline. Cinematography is on an up, which makes the audience awe. Because most of my friends were very positive about it and it has such a high rating, I really wanted to give this show an honest shot. I watched 5 episodes (1,3,4,5 and 6), but I really can't comprehend why so many people (including my friends) think so highly it.<br/><br/>Call me critical, but I feel that if a show is sciency (projecting a view of the future and the technical advancements it holds), psychological (predicts how people behave in this futuristic setting) AND has a clear moral message, this projection should be VERY believably for the show to be any good. And in all the episodes I've seen, it utterly fails in this.<br/><br/>In all episodes I've seen:
<ul><li>the point the writers try to make is already obvious within 10 minutes, after which you are hammered to death with it.</li><li>to make this point as bluntly as possible, shortcuts are taken and story is sacrifised whenever needed.</li><li>the people act completely inhumane without any common sense.</li><li>the overacting is just painfull to watch. Again, probably emphasize the message the episode wants to convey. Take episode 2 for instance, with the woman who cries the entire episode.</li><li>there is just too little logic and sense of reality.</li></ul><br/><br/>It's like all the writers care about is getting their message across and shocking people with it, instead of coming up with a decent, believable story. I'd give the third episode a 6 the other ones 3's or 4's.<br/><br/>So, don't feel like there's something wrong with you if you don't like this show. There's more of us out there, really ;)<br/><br/>PS: don't click on 'this review wasn't helpful' just because you like the show and can't stand negative comments about it please. Thank you. The show is a good thriller if you don't mind keeping your brain to rest while you watch this show. <br/><br/>I think they should make an episode about how people are hooked up to this show. This perfectly fit their type of content, people like this show because they want to sound smart, they want to be called an audience that watches "dark" or "satirical-drama". <br/><br/>While in a real sense this show is nonsense, so many plot-holes. If you have any real idea of watching TV, you would know. If you have any sense of science of technology, if you ever paid attention to your high school science class, you would know that this is all as fiction as a fiction can be. <br/><br/>3/10 because it can be a good pass time. #BlackMirror
Must see.
I loved it until season 4
Seasons 1-4 are fantastic and a must see. Bandersnatch was very interesting. These 4 seasons are on society and human condition.
On its own, season 5 is watchable. Compared to the previous seasons however, it's waste. This show was an easy 9/10 or even 10/10. It was fun, satirical and it has gone to where the pain starts.
Then Season 5 came along and it was like any other american, 100% non controversial, middle of the road nonsense.
Lost all of it's bite.<br/><br/>too bad, time to move along The spirit of this dystopic show is still alive. Unfortunately only 3 episode. This show is one of the best tv shows that I have ever seen it's soo realistic great directing great actors grreeaattt writing Brooker has created a virtuous science fiction drama anthology. This series has outstanding direction, writing, cinematography, special effects, custome, settings, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast deliver bravura realistic performances and includes the likes of Howard, Hamm, Plemons, Kaluuya, John-Kamen, Atwell, Flynn and many more stellar artists. The series is a tapestry of futuristic and modern-day stand alone tales that are thrilling, perplexing, crisp and full of satire. Using technology as a source of paranoia, the stories explore the collective anxious state of mind of the world. Each story features it's own cast of prodigious and mystifying characters. The plots for each episode are clever, unique, thought provoking, insightful, duplicitous, cathartic and have stunning endings. It's a refreshing look at how technology can turn on society when in today's world people feel like they're missing out on or aren't part of something bigger if they're not participating in some form of social media. The series also scrutinizes technology turning on itself, humans using technology to turn on eachother and humans using technology to turn on themselves. This is a one of a kind, captivating, mesmorizing and memorable series. I look forward to viewing what the series has in store for next season. This makes you both entertained while you use your brain. It tales our digital world to the extreme and I just love it. My favorite TV Show of all time. It's a series of science-fiction anthologies focusing on potential ugly outcomes of technology innovation, and many of them are already about to happen. Episodes are standalone with their own original story, but they all share the main theme of how technology might affect us and reveal the hideous side of our soul. Furthermore, their typical dark and ironic tone are so exceptional, it blends in perfectly with the main theme. Besides, the anthology approach was really a great choice because it keeps the audience focused on core concept of the series while enjoying various stories rather than be attached to some recurrent characters in a standard approach. Indeed, the show has never ceased to amaze us, either with unimaginable ideas of technology, or sometime with new plot development regarding similar tech innovations but from very different angles. Like its creator - Charlie Brooker said: "There was a signature tone to the stories, the same dark chocolate coating - but the filling was always a surprise." And all together, that's what has made Black Mirror stand out as an uniquely remarkable picture of our time.<br/><br/>
* The series's title was inspired by the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitors, a smart-phone... when it's off - technology's "black mirror" that can reflect the darkness of humanity.<br/><br/>* Some of you might decide to abandon the series after watching the 1st episode. That's a terrible mistake! In fact, I consider it as one of the weakest stories of the collection. In my opinion, as it was a pilot, Brooker didn't want to go too deep, therefore the shocking stayed in the shallow but not in the profound. However, don't give up on the show because of it! Otherwise you'll miss some extraordinary gem that'll make you regret.
So far, my 3 favorite stories are: 3rd - "The Entire History of You" (season 1); 2nd - "Black Museum" (season 4); and especially the 2014 Christmas special, "White Christmas", has been my number one ever since. I am not finished all seasons and episodes but it is enough to see first season to write some good review about this article. This extraordinary serial shows you if you are so deep into the technology how its affect you. The best of the serial is the episodes are not linked to each other. Each episodes gives you a short movie taste. One of the best tv series which has complete new story in every episode. All episodes ends with an open ending which is the best part of the series. Charlie Brooker is the Albert Einstein in scifi story writing, the Jules Verne of our time. The series is dark, ingenious and thought-provoking. Typically a series can stretch for years on a single storyline that works. The genius of Charlie Brooker is that he can come up with so many stories that are all unique and interesting. Now this replaced Mind Hunter as my favorite show on Netflix. Say is surrealist is not enough.<br/><br/>Come on, a guy can take a picture of the actor like that? Where is the security? And the finger... come on, aren't there any specialist who know the difference between a MALE and a FEMALE finger? And the news girl, come on, can anyone SERIOUSLY believe she can go there so easily?<br/><br/>What are we? 6 year old children who don't see those details? Are we that stupid?<br/><br/>Unbearable. Remember, the devil is on the details.<br/><br/>P.S. The acting is good though, a shame they didn't look for the same level of detail when taking those things into account. A friend recommended this show a while ago and to pass the time in between new Twin Peaks episodes we decided to binge this series. The first season kept us hooked really well. Original writing, super sharp editing, decent acting and class. The next few episodes in season 2 were still good and exciting. A lot of nice atmosphere, which I love.<br/><br/>But when season 3 started everything seemed different. It went from clever to mediocre acting and shallow writing. And these predictable plots are worked out in an action-for-the-sake-of-action package. So then we lost interest. <br/><br/>The page turner effect vanished somehow, it's almost like the later episodes are student films, which is a shame really, I'd prefer it if shows just stopped when the inspiration is gone. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the first two seasons are definitely worth a watch. There's not much to say about this show other than its a really unique masterpiece, showing the decay of society covered by pretended smile and ignorance. How even morale persons under the influence of rotten society rules go on the dark path of egoism. The incredible accuracy of how people with different characters will behave in certain situation is what stands out most in this series. Stand alone episodes about the consequences and the power of technology. Quite possibly situations that will happen in the future. The acting in this show is superb!<br/><br/>I highly recommend it to people who enjoy understanding todays society and are worried of the direction this world is taking. And the acting in this show is superb! The first two seasons of this program were about as good as television can be. Genuinely amazing. Unfortunately, everything past that isn't half as good. Not sure what changed between then and now, but something definitely has. I saw the adverts for this series, and it was after seeing that it was repeated that I noticed Charlie Brooker was the creator, and being a huge fan of his last drama Dead Set I was certainly going to watch the three episodes. Episode 1: The National Anthem, sees Princess Susannah (Lydia Wilson) kidnapped, and as ransom for her safe return the demands are that Prime Minister Michael Callow (Quantum of Solace's Rory Kinnear) must have sexual intercourse with a live pig and it must be broadcast on all news channels. After many attempts to solve the problem with alternatives, such as locating the kidnapper hideout, this disgusting act is forced to happen, but the Princess was released before the deadline, and even though Michael's career continues his social and home life is less good. Episode 2: Fifteen Million Merits, sees a bleak automated Britain where people are forced to live inside a place where to earn credits for food, and enjoy visual entertainment, e.g. pornography from Wraith Girls, they must constantly ride on exercise bikes, and they lose merits for buying food and skipping entertainment. Bingham 'Bing' Madsen (Psychoville's Daniel Kaluuya) decides to help out new friend Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) get her chance to become a singing star on X Factor style talent show Hot Shot, with judges Judge Hope (Rupert Everett) and Judge Charity (Julia Davis) and Judge Wraith (Ashley 'Bashy' Thomas). This costs him 15,000,000 merits of his, but he is not bothered as he does not do luxuries, but in the end she ends up on Wraith Girls, and he only "gets out" by speaking his mind about the system, but he remains in near solitary. Episode 3: The Entire History of You, technology has allowed people to store all their memories, such as conversations and experiences, in their heads with the help of super chip placed near behind their ears, and they can look back and experience any of these again. Young lawyer Liam Foxwell (Toby Kebbell) starts suspecting his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker) is having an affair with a man called Jonas (Tom Cullen), and he is looking back on any memories he has that would suggest this, and obviously he forces her to show her memories and confirm the suspicions. The series is a great satirical play on the significance technology has played in the world, the first episode focusing on the Twitter age and news coverage, the second on the impact of applications and talent shows, and the third about image capturing, and obviously the title Black Mirror refers to ourselves being part of all this, it is a must see drama mini series. Very good! It went from slick, sophisticated, edgy, original beyond belief in Seasons 1 and 2. Seasons 1 and 2 and 'White Christmas' were amazing. To sloppy, predictable, ordinary and barely even watchable just average tv. It's so boring.<br/><br/>Beginning with Season 3 season.<br/><br/>As if by magic, the magic is all gone. Evaporated. Supplanted by this . . . what IS this . . . season 3 and 4 crap.<br/><br/>The tight editing is gone. The writing is gone. The directing is gone. It's slow. It's boring. It's so unbelievably stupid.<br/><br/>This is a horrible disappointment as any fan will recognize. Something so special. So apart from all the other work out there to be so totally adulterated.<br/><br/>What happened? Netflix happened.<br/><br/>AND there goes season 5 . . . crap as well. ...only for the very, very, very, and I hate to repeat myself, very faint of mind. You have got to be kidding me? An 8.9 rating? Are you people insane? This series is absolutely awful.<br/><br/>I see that many of the reviews are outside the U. S., which might explain the rating (different tastes). It's the only explanation for such a high rating.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but other than the first story, the rest were boring and slow. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this. I've just discovered the extraordinary showstopper, "Black Mirror", a British sci-fi television series that is part "Twilight Zone" but darker and more bizarre. In six episodes in Season One we are let into a dystopian future narratively thrilling yet outrageous, because of its plausibility. Each episode, like "Twilight Zone", has a separate story and a different cast. You can view the episodes in any order. More a short story collection than a novel, "Black Mirror" is less a dystopia than it is the dark side of life and the darkest regions of the mind. Read the entire review at: www.unhealedwound.com under the December 29, 2014 post: "Black Mirror"--"Dark Reflections of the Mind." The title I give can seem provocative, but this series really annoyed me. I will admit that I didn't watch all of it - dear god, after a few episodes, the idea of watching the whole thing seemed like torture. <br/><br/>Yes this series is filmed with a decent quality and will look quite nice. it's "edible" to the eye. no critique on that part.<br/><br/>The actors weren't the greatest, but then, none that I saw was horribly bad either. No critique to the directors either.<br/><br/>Major critique to the script writers. the people writing this series went to a "creative writing" program, came out with a fancy degree, but have never creatively written in their lives. take an online creative writing course, and after a few classes you will understand exactly what I mean. It's always the same guidelines - create a character with flaws, but with a strong will to achieve a desire. make their desire clear, and obvious. Then, find obstacles. since this series is supposed to be "disturbing", of course the obstacles has the better of them.<br/><br/>There would be too many examples for me to give here, but again with the script writing, there are major plot holes everywhere. Some of them are so undeniably obvious that even some of my friends who enjoy this show, admitted, despite all their will to defend it, that what I pointed out was indeed huge inexplicable plot holes. <br/><br/>Finally I see neither what is really disturbing nor what is really interesting. That the show tries to have situations that are realistic yet futuristic compared to society as we know it, I get, but there are so many things where I just don't really grasp the major difference in comparison to our current social or political situations, that it just ends up being contemporary society with a bunch of gadgets, which end up in the same results. I mean that those gadgets don't really make an impact that changes much, compared to our current society. It's not social science fiction as it tries to be - it's social drama that they tried to make into science fiction. This show isn't more disturbing than the world as it stands now. Is it awakening people? I don't really think so, as most people will just see it as "bleak"-ish science fiction.<br/><br/>I recommend reading the review on here that also says that it's essentially a high budget rip-off of the twilight zone.<br/><br/>Bad script writing renders black mirror an uninteresting bore, and no amount of fancy visuals can make up for all the clichés, lack of imagination, and mechanical, industrial story lines. .............<br/><br/>Waste of time<br/><br/>I wish I had read some of the other comments about this show earlier. I mean the ones that say it's awful and a waste of time. That's what it is.<br/><br/>Never wrote a review before. But this is far too overrated. Please use your time for one of the many good productions<br/><br/>I am sure you can find a lot of movies of people "meeting" animals.. if you are into this stuff. But even if you like this show, please don't trick people into watching this with your rating<br/><br/>....... I'll keep this review short and simple. Black Mirror is horror that we live on a daily basis. I feel like me typing out this review could be made into a Black Mirror episode that would scare the crap out of me. There are no cheap jump scares, no things that go bump in the night. This is pure psychological warfare. This is questioning your reality. The scariest part? We're always one second away from being a Black Mirror episode...or maybe we're already living in one right now. Black Mirror is one big glitch in the Matrix and I'm living for it. No matter what device you're reading this review on right now, once the screen times out, there's only you, and your reflection in that Black Mirror. Worst script I have ever encountered. In the same league as the lowest budget teen TV series from Disney Channel. I am almost a little bit impressed by how bad it was and how painful it was to watch. My hopes and dreams related to the new season of this masterpiece have been crushed, spat on and annihilated by every second of it . <br/><br/>The issues showcased in every episode of BM SE04 are just plain dumb, do not take into consideration common sense, humane instincts, are diminishing the grandeur of science and in fact neglect the directions of scientific evolution. <br/><br/>Sadly I would not recommend the latest season to anyone. 
Painful to watch.<br/><br/>This is all in contrast to Seasons 1-3 to be exact. Usually, I try to keep away from dystopias because I can't bear their gloominess and pessimism. When I started watching Black Mirror I only knew that it's a criticism of modern society. But I didn't expect to see that shocking, dark, disturbing depiction of a very near future. But once started watching I couldn't stop. I watched and wondered which dark tale I would see next.<br/><br/>I absolutely adore British TV shows, they are a gripping and unique blend of comedy and drama, and distinguished English humor is always a ray of light even in the most tragic circumstances.<br/><br/>Black Mirror is not like that. No humor. No ray of light. Only shocking truth.<br/><br/>In the majority of the science-fiction films the future technologies are just a part of the society and it isn't shown how they affect our lives on minor levels. Well, Black Mirror shows it like no other film or show. It shows how new gadgets, technologies, social media and entertainment industry imperceptibly slowly and steadily change our perception, change worlds (Waldo's Moment), societies (National Anthem, White Bear, 15 Million Merits), life of individuals (The Entire History of You, Be Right Back.)<br/><br/>Each episode deserves a separate review, separate kudos, but I'll express my thoughts shortly on each of them here:<br/><br/>1. The National Anthem - the first and the best episode for me. I'm totally freaked out by it. By a society that gathered to watch the most humiliating act forced over an individual. If only a few people from this mob have refused to watch it they could have prevented it. But they haven't.<br/><br/>2.15 Million Merits - unlike other episodes, which describe life and situations, in which we can easily imagine and find ourselves in today or tomorrow, this episode is entirely futuristic. It contains an exaggerated image of modern society: unified people with unified lives zombified by TV. Sometimes in this world appears something real, something beautiful, something innocent. Then it's broken. Sometimes somebody resists. Then they are sharply made the part of the system again.<br/><br/>3. The Entire History of You - basically it's a family drama. The future technology from this episode can be useful for people with bad memory, and can turn into in evil by creeps, who like to think about their past relationships. The evil in this episode is also that with the help of this technology main character humiliates his wife in a way that no one has right to do because everybody has a right to privacy, even spouses.<br/><br/>4. Be Right Back - we see a beautiful girl Martha who resists the influence of modern gadgets and social media, but eventually, ends up dating a software.<br/><br/>5. White Bear - a society must have a code. If there are crimes there must be punishment. But even a death penalty and Lynch Law are more civilized and merciful than that what we have here. The law can't be sadistic and entertaining. Otherwise, it's not a law, it's a crime.<br/><br/>6. Waldo's Moment - do you want to be ruled by a cartoon that stands for nothing, thinks nothing, offers no decisions, only farts, insults and makes jokes about its d..k? Well, they want.<br/><br/>To conclude, if you want to broaden your horizons, watch British TV shows. First two seasons were ok, but then all go downhill. Not worth of time. Looked forward to something new and different on Netflix. As a big sci-fi & horror fan, the intro and reviews got me very interested. So I set aside a few hours to binge late one evening and boy, what a disappointment. Two shows, two hours, too long! The concepts were old, not fresh; production values were poor; the plots, derivative; the writing, amateurish. Did I say slow? Very!! I know I shouldn't rate a show on only two episodes but I doubt that this is one that will grow on me, especially since most reviewers think it peaked in the beginning. Black Mirror used to be about people you know in dystopian futures. Now it's the future First World Problems of attractive, wealthy people in LA.<br/><br/>What happens if an affluent suburban dad (with a 6-pack) falls for an equally affluent college buddy (also with a 6-pack) in a VR simulation? Also they're brahs! In case you didn't realise that, there are many exaggerated handshakes, hugs, etc. I don't quite know what the actors are doing, but they're doing a lot of it.<br/><br/>Sadly this seems like the sort of textbook 'dystopia' pablum that Booker would have deconstructed not so long ago. At the end of the day though ... Netflix has cash. Last season was not as expected but Miley episode was so much fun idk why people are hating on it. Maybe they are jealous or something idk but just the season i am disappointed with the rest its an awesome and must watch series However, season 5 was very disappointing and not make it justice. Thats why -1 Just the 1st was good, the last 2 were thumbs down. Black Mirror, Season 5, 3 hour-long episodes.<br/><br/>Ep1, Striking Vipers (60 mins): Charlie Brooker's premise is that there's no sex like VR sex. Danny and Karl, a pair of straight black guys, experience sexual-confusion when they play a VR fight-game "Striking Vipers X", one whose avatar is a hot blond chick and the other a hot asian dude. After their first awkward VR kiss, there's very little fighting and a whole lot of R-rated soft porn - yes, you have to suspend a WHOLE LOT of your critical thinking to let this play out. Danny is married and boinking wife Theo for a kid but his torrid albeit confusing affair with Karl's avatar in "Striking Vipers X" is adversely affecting those efforts. She suspects something but he's committed to the lie till he can't, then just forget the ending because that is NOT how things would play out, but Black Mirror is more about stretching the possible than adhering to the likely. Episode is about twice as long than it needs to be. Rating: 7 of 10<br/><br/>Ep 2, Smithereens (70 mins): Charlie Brooker's cautionary tale of social media's responsibility in distracted driving. This episode delivers commentary on several elements of technology: the inherent insecurity of ride sharing, how social media founders have lost control over their creations, and how easy it can be to surmount rigid password privacy rules if you're connected. Episode is about 1/3 longer than it needs to be. Rating: 8 of 10, has a touching moment or two<br/><br/>Ep 3, Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too (67 mins): Miley Cyrus plays Ashley O, a famous pop singer victimized by an overlording adoptive aunt and her coterie. Rachel is a young femme fan of Ashley's and even more so when Ashley releases a tiny android version of herself called "Ashley Too" to help young girls build self-esteem and confidence. Once the full potential of the little droid is realized though, it unleashes the full, profanity-laden personality of Ashley O. There's another tech element to this but it's not worth describing since the whole episode is marred by three things: first, its target demo is tween girls and guess who doesn't watch "Black Mirror" at all? Yeh, tween girls. Second, Miley Cyrus as pop star plays more to her fantasy than ours, and her voicing the "Ashley Too" bot is so raw and without any voice-over talent, it just sounds like her talking/swearing in normal voice. And third, throughout the episode she sings a butchered pop version of "Head Like a Hole" (Nine Inch Nails, 1989) and it just grates your soul. Masculine Guy Rating: 3 of 10, Tween Girl Rating: 8 of 10<br/><br/>Overall rating for the season: 6 of 10, meh, blah I loved this show, a great dystopian view on how the world will almost certainly become! Was really looking forward to it but series 5 is just nothing at all - I've stopped watching after E02 and won't go back. Maybe Charlie Brooker is planning something genius which exposes our IMDB review culture but I'm afraid I have to agree with all the other S5 reviews I've read. Very disappointing. Ring Pilkington if you're short of ideas! Dangerously creepy mind and bending experience every episode. Among the greatest shows of our existence! Many great realizations that people probably don't think about. I can think of a few people that can sit through & not take in the messages that represent our very existence in a metaphorical genius true way whether with technology, traumatic series of events, mind control, illusions, or being trapped in some way, which is unfortunate for those that aren't woke!<br/><br/>Regardless of woke or not, I'm happy this is available for people to immerse into the dark reality we live in. Sci-Fi episodes or not they have an extremely valid point to get across to the viewers. Outstanding scary good grittiness all around; will always remain in my favorites. If the pilot episode had a female prime minister people would be outraged and the next episode, as boring as watching paint dry. It was his personal choice and nothing to do with saving anybody's life. Drama needs conflict. There was no conflict. Might be interesting for those, who imagine the conflict, where one does not exist. Showing the media and the public in the disgusting way as they are shown looks like an illustration of the maker's personal perceptions. To tell right from wrong - Film Review on Black Mirror S01E01<br/><br/>What if the palace, the public and the Party want the leader of a country act disgracefully? While from the S01E01, we can easily tell that even the prime minister has to comply with the public will, embarrassing the requirement though, the people enjoyed the event at the beginning and felt offended and the terrorists'obscene dictation disgusting at last.So who won? <br/><br/>The first lady begged his husband not to conform crying "I know the people." But didn't the prime minister know? He was supposed to be the political leader of the kingdom with an intelligent administration to help him,suited up in the world stage,a dirty trick played by some terrorists,a pig,live on the air,how about you go fuk yourself？<br/><br/>However the kidnappers were smart, so they held the princess, a beloved royal member to sway the public, thus the public were dragged to their side though they might not support their act, but from a totalitarian perspective, an embarrassing awkwardness weigh way less than one's life,let alone a royal one. A moral dilemma was designed elaborately, and the people were led deliberately against the political elite, their emotional resentment towards the elites were activated, on this specific subject.Now let's take a look from the prime minister's side, what was set before him?<br/><br/>The palace want him to submit,the public too and the Party, even though he was the party leader. He hesitated,If he yielded, then he would attain better palace relationship and public support and even consolidated his leadership inside the party and against the opposition in the next election.Ever thought of the cost of this possible "Pig" move,dismembered by the human race and a horrible experience accompany him for the rest of his life.Political profit tempting him, but the line was dropped there telling him not to do anything inhuman. <br/><br/>Provided that there could be a compromise between pros and cons, thought our leader,suddenly a idea came up to him." This move won't be inhuman at all, since the people want it, the people want it and I am the political representative democratically elected by the people, so I should follow the public will and gain my credit by this courageous move." <br/><br/>"The people are ignorant and misguided." Said Sir Humphrey, I should add no more but usually the people can't tell right from wrong.<br/><br/>Something Real - Film Review on Black Mirror S01E02<br/><br/>In post-mordern life, consumer-level technology has dominated our everyday experience, with which we consume music from the music industry, reality shows from the TV industry, electronic devices and online entertainment from theose tech giants, we have man-machine interaction and commodities to assist or to devalue us physically and mentally, everything on earth become man-made, then shall we bother ourselves wonder, is there something real left?<br/><br/>New God<br/><br/>Not much as one could expect in the future probably, apples and an origami crane were the only visible clues and items in this episode, anything else? Right, the voice, the voice of the female character Abby, in this fantastic totalitarian world, tradition and conventions were eliminated by progressive demand, family ties and blood relationships weakened, everyone living in boxes with big screens, we all cling to the state or the community as the background of the film set in, more precisely in this case, pop culture or government by the masses. If say God died centuries ago, we worship celebraty gossips and money today, so when given a chance of ascending to the top of the society, would one be hesitated? Abby believed it worths a try.<br/><br/>Judge Hope and Judge Charity<br/><br/>The pop culture has been selling hopes and dreams to the public successfully, exploiting our vanity and ambition for their own profit. Consumers seem rather servile to such culture and embrace it enthusiastically, from those dreamers practicing their shows backstage, hoping that one day they could enter the stage and become a real star, by judgement of Judge Hope and Judge Charity, see the essence of this whole thing is charity and your hope, the hopeless you are begging the judges! People can be so spineless confronting wealth and higher social status, while the judges can be cruel, simply because this is a show to them after all. The audience are onlookers like zombies with their virtual characters on the screen behind the judges, who knows that by watching other people performing and becoming star, their stories may well be a good inspiration and preparing them to be potential players!<br/><br/>Stuff<br/><br/>Also we can see how the pop culture or TV and Internet has influenced day and life of our age, violence video games and pornography are the most popular content online and we are obsessed with virtual stuff, some User Generated Content is mostly nothing but rubbish, even though we share them on Facebook and Twitter, socializing. The industry boomed and jobs guarateened but what about life or spiritual aspect, who cares if you are due to get excitement in the next 30 minutes? Let alone future generations.<br/><br/>It takes too much for an individual to fight against the entire system, Abby failed, so did Bingham, digital screens are everywhere and we finally compromise as a docile consuming vessel. When Bingham drank that cup of condensed juice on the table near the industrial crane statue, we all realised the answer. Not all the episodes of Black Mirror are great but there is a decent variety of them... Ironically Blue Bear associates with Trump and David Cameron does like bacon... The show touched a lot of interesting subjects, but some of the best ideas were taken from other shows not widely known to major public and popular culture... The whole concept of consciousness transfers, comes from BSG/ Caprica, especially from Caprica, a show not many now and not many heard about... So if you like the whole idea of storing consciousness on other devices or inside robots, transferring them to other virtual worlds and so on and so on, check out Caprica... Nevertheless "USS Callister was my favourite episode and as much as I love it it's a dark Star Trek which should have had his own spin off... A perfect example how mixed a series can be.
Black Mirror is a series about how technology will change our future. Every episode is independent and from a different director.<br/><br/>I recommend watching season one, two and four, but not season three and five.<br/><br/>The first two seasons where the good starting of the producers, but when Netflix bought the series, there came season three. And that season was ... just bad. The story's where very bad.<br/><br/>Then Netflix made season four and that one is my favorite. The following season five was not good. Not as bad as season three but not really worth to watch. I love science fiction genre and the show has completely lived upto my expectations .Every episode is different and provides a new innovative idea .Science fiction is generally difficult to portray but Black Mirror does it amazingly well. It can also be great for people who are on a tight schedule and get very less time to enjoy ,they could watch a single episode and be at work again unlike other shows in which we keep thinking what will happen next ðŸ˜‚ even when we are at work .A must watch show for people who want something new! The fusion of fiction and imagination with perfect presentation creates magic, if you add darkness to it, it breaks the boundaries of all imaginations. That's what Black Mirror does. The idea and its execution is flawless. Bravo team Black Mirror! When i think creativity is fading, you shake me to the core with every new episode, and i find myself swimming, drowning in the deepest sea of thoughts and awe!!! I always like new idea ,and this series all about new ideas and perfectly surprised me by any episodes ,i f suggest you to watch it , you wont regret it No other show on earth has ever made me feel so disgusted and upset but then can't wait to binge the rest! absolutely brilliant! I wish they made more of them, there are so many other things to write about so I know that is not a problem , the problem is netflix and them footing the bill to them so they can start up Season 6. Each episode tells a different story, so chances are that you will like most of them. However, the fifth season was pretty meh in comparison, boring episodes with uninteresting stories. Just fall flat. I love how dark and semi realistic this show is but it feels like every other episode is not that interesting. Some episodes seem like they're focusing more on the artistic filming than the actual plot. Both are obviously important but a beautifully filmed episode with little or uninteresting plot (or massive plot holes) is not worth watching. I love that this show focuses on the ways humanity can become perversed by technology but the more recent episodes look more like futuristic distopian stuff where the characters are all play into their most depraved desires rather than normal people being corrupted by tech or the opportunities it can bring I thought it was just the first episode that was weak and a waste of time, so persevered to a second episode. Bigger waste of time. What can you expect from Black Mirror? Bad acting, lack of direction, poorly spoken English "actors" (they can't act, not even Rupert Everett delivers anything credible), lack of ....well everything you want in a series that has so much hype. The hype is completely unwarranted. Do yourself a favor and just move on to some quality shows like these: Billions; The Good Wife; Damages; The Affair; Rectify; Brooklyn Nine-Nine (Comedy); House of Cards; Better Call Saul or even Fargo (Series I only, Series II loses its way). All of these have great character and plot development, talented actors, great stories lines and twists, and give you plenty to think about and talk about. Throwing dog poo on a wall might be considered art to some, but it's not. Black Mirror might be considered art, but it's not! This drama is the worst I have ever seen.Its just a piece of abominable things.It contains sinister things.Just the shame things.Parental guide will make you just hate this drama.Its just a waste of time and nothing more.They have wasted their breath for it .It is just facile. It's like these guys with the cardboard sign "The end is near" or these christian fanatics with "Homosexuality is a sin". Most episodes are just exaggerating actual society phenomenons. Yes, technology is changing fast and with it our society and social behaviour. But most episodes feel like a sermon. Pretty exhausting after 3 seasons. 6 Stars, but because there are some decent episodes among the seasons, 7 stars. Started with s1e1 out of curiosity. Whole Episode hinges on if PM will have sex with a pig to save a kidnapped princess. Not only yes, but the show feels the need to show parts of this act of bestiality as well. Pure filth made worse by the fact Netflix is willing to air it. Extra Lines Added For IMDb's Moronic Requirement Fear of technology. That is what this series seem to represent. How we are all enslaved by science and technology, which will ultimately doom us all. Black mirror is basically fearmongering, especially about social media. Almost every single episode's underlying theme is how facebook and twitter is this vile cesspool that only brings out the absolute worst in people and only spawns trolls, bullies and terrorists, a system that makes us all soulless total psychopaths reveling in mass murder and human suffering.<br/><br/>Black Mirror seems to be made by old people. The kind, who only have a cursory understanding of modern technology, probably from the news and conspiracy nut blogs, and they envision this formless evil beast that will inevitably destroy humanity. We all fear what we don't understand, and the creators of this series are just bringing this concept to the extreme. You can see it in every episode: social media is evil tyranny, modern medical and scientific advances are just waiting to kill us all, and where one single person is enough to hack some automated system and go on a killing spree, while the authorities are just fumbling about completely powerless. <br/><br/>Aside from one single episode, Season 3's "San Junipero", the entirety of Black mirror is totally ridiculous, pandering fearmongering, that exploits people's lack of knowledge about technology and sends a completely wrong message. This sort of luddite thinking and behavior is what lead to the Dark Ages...<br/><br/>Having said all that, Black Mirror is a surprisingly well put- together series. The production value is very high, and for a sci-fi TV series, the CGI is remarkably good. The stories (discounting the subject matter) are well written and well acted. Some of the episodes tend to be sluggish and boring in places, but I chalk that up to the creators, who seem to be from the old-school sci-fi scene with strong hints of Stanislaw Lem and Phillip K. Dick influences.<br/><br/>All in all, Black Mirror is very well made sci-fi series, that is just a bit too on the nose about it's hatred for modern technology and especially social media. It's definitely worth a watch if you can distance yourself from the ridiculous fearmongering. Upon viewing the first episode I wasn't sure how the show was going to progress. Alas, the second episode is a completely different story. "Black Mirror" repeatedly and perfectly depicts what the future may hold for us as people of the world if we continue to increase our dependence and reliance on technology and social media respectively. As I believe the title is intended to foreshadow, it shows us a dark reflection of ourselves. The show eloquently brings to light how future technologies can make our lives immensely better, but as history has shown us, and as is depicted in the show, immensely better can easily become immensely problematic.<br/><br/>As for my taste in shows, I appreciate developed characters and plot randomness or unpredictability. Charlie Brooker I applaud thee because the characters are consistently fully developed and you can never pin down where the episodes are going to go. The character development leads you to easily empathize with the various situations the series puts them in, and by the end of the episodes you'll find yourself evaluating their decisions as if they were you're close friends.<br/><br/>Brilliant execution, use of technology, and plot development - simply brilliant. An anthology series of sorts, where technology and humanity don't always lead to pleasant results. This satirical and usually demented show is great in its technical craftsmanship and usually sharp and witty in its execution. The first episode The National Anthem is a great start to this series, about the princess being kidnapped and the Prime Minister being told he needs to have sex with a pig or she dies. This sounds lowbrow, but it's pulled off with a straight face and in lesser hands this would have been written into a corner - but the ending simply works. 8/10<br/><br/>The second episode Fifteen Million Merits is perhaps the best of the series, about a society that peddles stationary bikes to generate power and the individual earns points to purchase products or a chance to appear on a contestant show. The idea is thoughtfully explored, there's a quick budding romance that's wonderfully done and the episode goes into some dark places. This is a great piece of science fiction. 9/10<br/><br/>The third episode The Entire History of You explores the trivial bits of nonsense we obsess about, when everyone has recorders implanted in the back of our heads and you have the ability to record and playback any time, anywhere. What begins with our lead going through his job interview and replaying one phrase that could be interpreted in any way, over and over - leads to an obsession about the possibility of his wife having an affair. The segment is well acted and the use of the technology feels entirely believable. 7/10<br/><br/>The second season didn't engage me - sometimes at all. The first episode Be Right Back, felt too cold and distant and felt empty and pointless by the end. 5/10<br/><br/>The second episode White Bear hinged on a twist gimmick that was both a strength and a weakness. The twist works as an idea, but sours everything before it and both the twist and the preceding events felt half baked. Didn't deliver. 4/10<br/><br/>The third episode The Waldo Moment, about a depressed comedian voicing a crude animated character that ends up being used as a political puppet to disrupt an election is successful enough. But like all the episodes this season, the sharp wit and beautifully thought out visuals are missing. 6/10<br/><br/>The White Christmas special plays up the anthology format for the first time, as two men in a mysterious outpost kill time on Christmas by telling their stories that led them to this point in their life at this outpost. The three stories are all engaging and the use of the technology feels remarkably real and the results are haunting and twisted in its humor and drama. A great return to form. 7/10 If you want to eat popcorn in your couch and watch something predictable where the bad guys are killed mercilessly by some agency one more time, wait for the decaf American remake, it could be even starred by Tom Cruise, of course, to add depth to the storyline, you know.<br/><br/>But if you're after something fresh, thought-provoking and that for sure can happen in the not-so-distant future, if not already happening now, give a try to Black Mirror.<br/><br/>A very interesting point is, they're not "distant-future" sci-fi stories, but relate to common people on the everyday use of our beloved gadgetry, the lack of regulation, the lack of privacy ... some of the stories are already happening today: Bullying, Video-recording in everyone's pocket, streaming of private life ... <br/><br/>If you like technology you'll love Black Mirror. So far this show doesn't dissapoint. There were a few stories that took a little while to get into, like the dating episode which left me feeling both happy and a bit disturbed.<br/><br/>But not nearly as bad as Black Museum or Crocodile (da hell was wrong with that woman!).<br/><br/>I found MetalHead to be the least like the rest of the stories, maybe because of the black and white footage or just the bleak landscape it shows. I still found it highly entertaining. Black Mirror's worst episode is better than a lot of series finales imo. Really makes you think about the damage companies like google and Facebook can do to society. Many of the episodes seem to be explicit commentaries on how dangerous in can be to trust companies that exist only to collect and exploit their users data. Black Mirror is a TV show that I missed when it originally aired on TV but I recently watched all 6 episodes to date on demand. It is a show that I found to be very different and unique in its own way. <br/><br/>The episodes all have their own story lines and completely different casts. The episodes blew a little hot and cold for me but overall I found it to be quite entertaining. <br/><br/>The 1st episode about the PM I found incredibly disturbing but it was riveting to watch. Episodes 2 and 3 seemed quite slow overall and not much actually happened but the cast done enough to make them watchable. The plots for these two episodes just sounded more interesting than I actually found them to be. <br/><br/>Series 2 I thought was much better than Series 1. Episodes 1&2 had incredible story lines that both came with a twist towards the end. These two episodes kept me on the edge of my seat. Hayley Atwell was absolutely incredible in the Be Right Back episode, some of the finest acting I've seen. The White Bear episode was exceptional too. A lot of fast paced action and really makes you wonder what is going on. The twist at the end of this episode worked incredibly well. Episode 3, The Waldo Moment was also pretty good, this one was pretty basic. It was more of a comedy and was good in its own way.<br/><br/>The National Anthem â€“ 8/10. Fifteen Million Merits â€“ 7/10. The Entire History of You â€“ 6/10.<br/><br/>Be Right Back â€“ 9/10. White Bear â€“ 9/10. The Waldo Moment â€“ 7/10<br/><br/>Overall Black Mirror is a very good watch but some episodes stand out from the others. 8/10. This is must watch sci fi series n full of surprises n thrill Ok, I know I'm late to this party but you might be too & looking for something truly exciting, smart & weird to stream (each episode like an exquisite film), you gotta check this out. I've never been a big sci-fi fan but this is something different: a Twilight Zone for the 21st Century. Pretty much the best thing we've seen on Netflix, an original series w/ the BBC. Charlie Brooker rules. Most of the Episodes are fantastic, some are not as Good I saw three seasons of this show. There were some good, but mostly bad. I get the impression that there are different writers and different directors. When you speak of an miscellany series like Twilight Zone then, well I expect to see that. The show left me wanting. Albeit the context was supposed to be sci-fi fantasy related I've seen much better on ordinary TV. If you are bored then you can watch them but you will probably fast forward or skip entire episodes after the first few minutes. The majority of the cast are almost unknowns but with some good writing it did okay. Season 1 episode 1 I enjoyed the most. After that the rest of the season left a dull taste in my mouth. AT MOST FOUR. Save yourself the pain and frustration.
It has gotten so bad. Like Game of Thrones bad. The original creator is still writing the episodes but I feel like all the negative reception (from s1-s3) was because the show is depressing, and that the producers ordered him to make every episode have a happy ending. I feel like Charlie Brooker is on a short-leash and he just doesn't care any more. The show feels completely uninspired, its signature tone has been flipped upside-down, and hardly any episodes since season 3 had any depth whatsoever. It's pretty sad because this was one of my favorites. Hate to see it happen like this but I would never recommend season 4, especially season 5 to anyone. Downloaded all episodes on my phone and watched them with my GF at night while away in Marrakech, I think.
Episodes from first seasons then gave us thrills and nightmares just as bad as being lost in the suburbs of the infamous marocan city when we had to pay to escape whole but enough about our trips.
It's trippy and I kept adoring the series all the way trough the last season.
It's worth getting a couple of months or even at least a free one just to watch this great series.
Good job Netflix!
I hope more episodes are in the making. I was so much hoping for this season (5) to get even more episodes than the previous ones. I (we) didn't. The three we do get is sadly garbage. The second one is a bit better, but only because of the performance of Andrew Scott.
It seems to me that the imagination of the writers are gone. There are some not-so-good episodes in the previous seasons, but none of them sinks to this depth.
Maybe I should be glad it's only three in this season? Loved the four previous seasons of Black Mirror. (TBH, I didn't get all the way through Season One Episode One, and I would suggest that potential viewers start after this particular episode.) The first four seasons were elevated Twilight Zone episodes (high praise from me). Watched the first two episodes of Season Five and they were subpar. Easy to see the twists. But I will give the rest of the season a try. If you want something well done in the same vein as S5 E2, please watch Get Out! by Oscar winning Jordan Peele. (Can't give enough praise for this film.) But, as I said, I am continuing to watch the rest of the season. (Yeah, maybe I should have waited to post after watching the entirety of this season.) This is a brilliant show! It is extremely disturbing and at the same time ingenious. It took me a year to watch second episode as I was too in shock from the first one. However it makes you question our time, our lives and society in general. I can't compare it to anything I've seen so far. Each episode leaves you speechless and the only thing you can actually say after a while is OMG! Some of the best episodes in the show are less rated than episodes that are more easy to understand ! I can't stress how good this series is. From the very first episode it just hooks you. Every episode is different which is brilliant. You will never get bored. This series makes you assess the world around you. A lot of what is depicted is happening now and you can imagine some of the other stories coming true eventually. I have seen all the episodes including 2018 and I just hope they will continue to make more. To like a movie/series I need a cahracter I can pesonalize with. But in Black mirror main characters usually do stupid decisions and basic mistakes from psychological point of view. 
I like the showed technology, but the stories bore me Therefore I don't see a difference between fast forwarding used technology and watching whole episodes. Don't get me wrong, the series is above good on acting and filming but most episodes deal with today's society and social media and technology in a kind of poor, even pretty stupid sometimes, way.
When I watch a dystopian, or even utopian gone terribly wrong as correctly mentioned in one review, movie or series I want to feel fear we might end up that bad in real life. Yet in 14 or more episodes of this i was like "aaaggghh that's plain stupid, poor, meaningless writing!!!"
You've been warned! A pretty interesting series. I especially liked that they cover such modern topics as social networking, gamification, American Idol-style shows and making videos with iPhone to upload them to youtube. There isn't much of this stuff in movies, I don't know why, maybe because film directors are just old and technically uneducated. When watching this series, I kind of had a feeling that movies just failed to catch up with the fast changing realities of our lives while this TV series does catch up.<br/><br/>I'm still giving it 8 and not 10 because the series doesn't feel like it's giving any deep message. Also, it a bit too one-sided. Cuz all these new technologies have major positive effects, not just negative ones, and the series only concentrates on the negative stuff. Also, the series generalizes too much. There are plenty of people on Facebook or Youtube who only need it for professional and business reasons, and plenty of professionals who put useful stuff there, not just farting dogs. There is still plenty of educated people in the world. This series goes too much in the direction of "Idiocracy" movie (2006), pretending too much that everyone becomes an idiot due to all these new technologies. This drama is the worst drama I've ever seen in my whole life.I just successfully wasted my 70 minutes watching its two episodes.They are really a disappointment.It's my sincere advice to all you people ,please don't waste your precious time.Go and enjoy with anything thing else but not with black mirror.I bet that if you watch Powerpuff girls instead of black mirror,it would be million times greater than this kind of facile thingy. The problem is it's not possible to be uploaded to the cloud like this. <br/><br/>In the future they may be able to upload a perfect copy of your brain, but even if you have no belief in a soul whatsoever, you can't deny that the only thing that's happening, is your brain is being copied, and that copy is being uploaded into the cloud.<br/><br/>It will be possible however, like in the episode, to be jacked in while you're still alive, because your brain is being directly stimulated, but when you die the brain dies. When they upload you into the cloud permanently all that will be happening is the copy goes on in the cloud believing it's you.<br/><br/>It's just basic common sense. I hoped people would understand this kind of thing after 'The 6th Day'.<br/><br/>Of course, it's going to be quantum, right? Yes, that's it, something on the quantum level makes it possible. Which is really just science finally discovering that we do in fact go on after death.<br/><br/>The quantum is where everything science calls pseudo-science and "Paranormal" will be brought to light! <br/><br/>;) The hype is real. 
I just finished all seasons (as of the date of this review seasons one to four). This show is great but far from amazing thanks to some oddball episodes that fall flat. The Christmas episode was outstanding and so was the one about the rating system. Templates for the future of mankind thanks to the evil corporations and satanic demons running Hollywood? Probably. Yeah, most of the world are all doomed because they are foolish enough not to see the warning signs. Meh, my work here is done and this review is over. From the opening shots in episode one you can tell this is a stylish yet very different take on television. The ideas and issues raised by Black Mirror make for a very intelligent viewing experience. The show tackles the implications and changes in human behavior related to the rise of new technology and media, it definitely lingers with you long after the closing credits. I have never seen anything similar. Each season contains only three episodes but this is a very real case of quality over quantity. I cant recommend this enough, if you haven't seen any work from creator Charlie Brooker you are in for a real treat. I look forward too see what ideas are install for the remaining episodes. My advise to a new viewer to the show would be the less you know going into it the better just sit back and enjoy the ride. There are very few movies or shows that have me glued to the screen, waiting breathlessly for the next scene. Black Mirror is one of them. Each episode is completely different but the casting is spot on each time and the story lines are brilliantly written and brought to life. <br/><br/>I found the technological theme very thought provoking. There are small details that contribute to the feeling that the episode could happen to us at any time, now or in the future. Even the futuristic episode (episode two out of the three I have watched) seemed not only plausible but probable, in one way or another. Fitness as a requirement for making their version of money? In our society obsessed with shape, weight and size? Absolutely!!<br/><br/>Curse my job that needs me to be present int he morning, I would stay up to watch the entire series in a heartbeat! only thing I should to say is it perfect, and I still stay for 3rd season. this series inspired for her movie and shown our feature life. Black Mirror is a British television anthology series created by Charlie Brooker that shows the dark side of life and technology. The series is produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. Regarding the programe's content and structure, Brooker noted, "each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they're all about the way we live now â€“ and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy. On 9 January 2014, Charlie Brooker announced the third series of the show, confirming at least two more episodes Forget what people say and watch it the first episode is the worst but still acceptable but the second and the third is incredible Before watching the three episodes that make up season 5 I had a look over reviews here at IMDb and I read many negative reviews and I also noticed the ratings for each of the season 5 episodes were lower than the average for Black Mirror.<br/><br/>I've now watched all three season 5 episodes and they really are very good indeed. I think all three of them are very good Black Mirror episodes and all three amongst the best of the series. In my opinion it is probably the best season the series has had.<br/><br/>There is a maturity to season 5 which I think may have confused some people. The characters are more developed and the analysis of the tech issue that is influencing their lives and society is a bit deeper.<br/><br/>I've seen many complain that the episodes are a bit slow but I think they are just missing that there is actually an increase in content, an increase in observation over previous episodes.<br/><br/>These three episodes have all managed to avoid being "one liners" which Black Mirror is prone to becoming. Earlier Black Mirrors have tended to just repeat the same idea over and over throughout the episode from different perspectives, but without any development.<br/><br/>In season 5 we are seeing much more development of the basic idea around which each episode is built.<br/><br/>Of the three episodes I think I liked Smithereens the best, although it is actually hard to pick a best one.<br/><br/>In Smithereens the portrayal of the police team was really first class as was the massive media company. There was just so much going on in that drama and I think if the detractors watch it again they might pick up on some of the things they have obviously missed.<br/><br/>The other two are also really packed with material. I do think that those that aren't getting this series should just watch them again and this time look for all the stuff they have missed. Season 1 and 2 is great,but season 3,4 and 5 are rubbish! Black Mirror is an anthology series that taps into our collective unease with the modern world, with each stand-alone episode a sharp, suspenseful tale exploring themes of contemporary techno-paranoia. The problem however, is that on some of the episodes, the writers desire to invocate twisted endings that convolute what starts out as a suspenseful tale, falls flat to any possible logic that would leave the viewer satisfied. Still, most of the episodes do succeed with a satisfying ending. 8/10 from me I binged the entire series (4 seasons) one weekend in 2018 (over 1,000 combined minutes in 19 episodes). Black Mirror has been reviewed ad-nauseum, and I have nothing more to add that will influence anyone's viewing decision either way. However, I will offer a brief opine and a selection of the best episodes for your consideration.<br/><br/>Each episode is a self-contained pseudo-science fiction story, running anywhere from 43 minutes to nearly 90 minutes. I can compare it to an updated version of The Twilight Zone, at least that's the first thing I thought of. Except, in Black Mirror the characters aren't really in another dimension per se, they're in the now and all the freaky stuff that happens is 'common' among the population.<br/><br/>Technology, and how it can affect (sometimes adversely) everyday life is the centerpiece of each episode. If you're looking for a feel-good series with predictable plots you're not going to find it in Black Mirror. You'll see the dark side of humanity and what people are capable of when this cool technology is exploited for all the wrong reasons: some of these episodes get really gloomy.<br/><br/>Although each story can stand on its own (you can afford to miss episodes and still know what's going on), I counted least seven chapters that briefly refer to another in the series (like a specific piece of technology, or a quote from a character). If you miss the reference, though, it's not going to totally throw you for a loop.<br/><br/>Among the dark themes, there is some humor. Odd, creepy humor. Don't feel weird or awkward laughing at certain situations that may otherwise be inappropriate. I was horrified after the first episode in season 1 (The National Anthem). Truly sickened, in fact. When I watched it a second time, I giggled like a mad-man. But it's that humor that makes Black Mirror a fun and addictive series to watch. Some of the 'laugh-out-loud' moments, for me, were in seeing justice get served to the deserving. What boundaries will they cross in the next season I wonder?<br/><br/>My favorite episodes are:<br/><br/>Season 1, Episode 3: The Entire History of You (9/10)<br/><br/>Season 2, Episode 2: White Bear (9/10)<br/><br/>Season 2, Episode 4: White Christmas (10/10)<br/><br/>Season 3, Episode 1: Nosedive (9/10)<br/><br/>Season 3, Episode 3: Shut Up and Dance (10/10)<br/><br/>Season 3, Episode 6: Hated in the Nation (9/10)<br/><br/>Season 4, Episode 3: Crocodile (9/10)<br/><br/>Season 4, Episode 6: Black Museum (9/10) This show is pretty damn good, I have to admit. Just like other programs, it took some time to get off the ground, and there are great episodes and horrible ones. <br/><br/>I think a ton of people watched the first episode, and seeing a prime minister forced to commit bestiality on national TV was too much for them. I admit, I was wondering what in the hell I had gotten myself into, but I must also admit= it kept me entertained and disgusted, all at the same time. It had my interest. After it ended, I thought about moving on to something else, but my interest was still piqued.<br/><br/>Well, I gave the show another try and binge watched most of the episodes. I really enjoyed half or more of them. Some were painfully slow, with no pay off at the end, but most of them offered some truly stunning and intriguing looks at technology and human behavior in the future. This is a really great look at humanity and things we might be facing in the not-so-distant future. If you have an intellectual mind or a love for weird dystopian/utopian worlds, and want to peek at where we might all be going with this stuff, you will certainly enjoy this show. A couple of episodes will leave you annoyed or asleep, but most of them were pretty cool. <br/><br/>The show also features some surprise guest stars as well, such as the leading man from Mad Men, and features some nice writing and bizarre plots. Check it out... Black mirror reflects. <br/><br/>Thank you Netflix for being the source of this discovery. I have watched many episodes more than once and each time i get more out of it. I am not writer and not a critic but only a viewer and I would like to thank the creator (s) for this series. <br/><br/>I registered on IMDb to write this note. <br/><br/>Congratulations for San Junipero Emmy's win. It is beyond deserved! I was so happy when i heard the winning news! San Junipero is a story that will stay with me forever. <br/><br/>Black mirror may be dark for some viewers, but the scripts and scenarios are so close to our present and future reality that it is hard to look away, and often in the most intriguing ways. Sorry my English is second to me but you get the point:-) <br/><br/>I am looking up for the next season! <br/><br/>Glad shows like yours exist.<br/><br/>Truly. Just a slight correct to make to an IMDb user : " Nomolost " The T.V. Series Black Mirror is supposed to be " inconsistent " as it has been compared to the American T.V. show " The Twilight Zone " each episode is a STAND ALONE episode . The individual episodes are not supposed to coordinate with each other . There is NOT supposed to be continuity . <br/><br/>Its a great show , great Sci Fi ....& I highly recommend it<br/><br/>The first episode deals with Social media , the Government and humiliation The Second Episode deals with Technology in general and has a George Orwell feel to it.<br/><br/>The third deals with ....Once again " Big Brother " George Orwell " issues " that is SEASON ONE !!!! The tv show is basically a scam. The writers are writing a new plot per episode and what's the point? You never have characters that you can actually understand they're all twisted and the endings are always terrible. I don't understand how it could be so highly rated I barely got through the first 2 seasons I thought to myself it'd get better, it just didn't so I don't recommend to anyone to watch it, there's better things to do with your life. It doesn't deserve this high rating..<br/><br/>tho the show is to entertain the kids If you like shows that make you feel sick and nauseous then this is the show for you! Kidnapping a young beloved royal and then forcing the prime minister to defile a pig on live television is not my version of entertainment. This was the most vile and repulsive show I have ever seen. As a woman, no as a person, it is disgusting to have sexual relations with someone or something (sentient being or not) that doesn't have the ability to give consent. The production and execution of the show may have great but that does not in any way, shape, or form allow for such a monstrous storyline. Loved this series until I got to Season 5. The analogy for me is: A Mercedes Benz that ran out of gas!! Bringing back the flavor of Twilight Zone and/or Outer Limits was brilliant. Time for some new fresh writers!! My Ratings for the 3 episodes as follows: 1) 0 Stars, 2) 10 Stars, 3) 4 Stars. As the song goes more or less: "I've lost that lovin feeling...." My 2 cents, nothing to live or die by!! Jerry I never expected this kind of a brilliant work in the form of a series. Especially, the white Christmas special episode, so far the best of all. This series shows how technology can be used to help a man or make his life miserable. Though it contains some dystopian view, it surely is a warning to people who thinks technology as their salvation.
Whoever's behind the scripts are geniuses. (Updated after Season 5).<br/><br/>A series of independent stories, all centred around technology. Is it a help or a hindrance?<br/><br/>Brilliant series, created and written by English comedian and social commentator Charlie Brooker. Highly original in its concept - examining possible technological advances, and seeing how these could be used, or abused, and how they can help us, or be the bane of our existence. Set at an everyday person level (mostly), so is highly engaging.<br/><br/>Plots are very intriguing and entertaining, drawing you in and keeping you locked in until the end. Often part of the intrigue is figuring out the innovation depicted in the episode and how it works.<br/><br/>In many of the earlier episodes, Brooker was happy to just make the revelation of the innovation the punchline, and then just let the episode run its course from there. These were not bad episodes - the are no bad episodes (the worst score I gave to an individual episode was 7/10) - but did leave me a bit disappointed. I kept thinking this series was going to be like Alfred Hitchcock in the 21st (or 22nd century) and the lack of a great twist towards the end or powerful conclusion made me wonder what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>However, with time Brooker's writing got better - grittier, more daring, more profound. He found his formula and pushed the envelope in terms of his creativity. While S2 E2 - White Bear - was the first episode I gave a 10/10 to, it was really only from Season 3 (starting with the brilliant Christmas special between S2 and S3 - White Christmas) where the series consistently delivered a punchiness to its endings. S3 E1 - Nosedive - was one of the scariest and depressing imaginings of future social interaction I've ever seen...and it was 100% plausible.<br/><br/>Things then went from strength to strength. The pinnacle, for me, was S3 E6 - Hated In The Nation. A murder mystery combined with highly plausible technology, engaging, well-developed characters (well portrayed too) and a big swipe at social media and the types of people who inhabit it. You're forced to think about your own moral view on issues, while not being lectured as to what is the "correct" choice. Brilliant episode.<br/><br/>Many aspects of the series give a damning, and quite relevant, view on society, and possibly where it is heading. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some episodes that are quite upbeat, even romantic (San Junipero, Hang the DJ) and in S4 E1 - USS Callister - Brooker makes use of his considerable comedic talent to deliver an episode that is wonderfully funny yet grippingly thrilling and action-filled.<br/><br/>Season 5 is a bit of a disappointment though. The plots are much more mainstream and less cerebral. There's flashes of the old Black Mirror but Brooker never really rams the point home or provides something profound. Very entertaining and still highly plausible but not of the same quality as the previous seasons. In a summary we can say that the proposal of this season had everything to go right, great storyline, ideas and technique, but lacked life, identification, and without it sounds like something shallow.
In a sentence about this season: It's like reading a book and not creating that world inside your head.
There is no emotion, feelings, identification, it's just cool. All 3 seasons are cleverly written, acted directed. They might not be perfect, but they are very very good. 
Season 4 however was the exact opposite. Boring, predictable, lazy writing, sometimes bad acting, or maybe just bad directed and a lot of plot holes. It's like a very bad, and weak remake of the original.<br/><br/>The only episode worthy of this show, from season 4, was the last one. This one is the only one, that really felt like black mirror. I really hope they'll do season 5 justice...if there will be. Hello,<br/><br/>To those of you with an IQ over 120 and with an education, imagination and not enslaved in a unhealthy religion that warps your mind....you will love it. Episodes that force the viewer to think and accept what the future might bring (and its not very nice)!<br/><br/>But to those of you giving this one star and wasting time with negativity and words pulled from your thesaurus, just give up and go away. Its obvious you don't have the imagination to follow this. Just a guess...how many novels (Sci_Fi, Speculative or classic) do you read a year? If the number is under 25 I weep for you. So much to learn before we die yet some waist time on sofa sports, drinking, and never traveling OUT of the US to see the world. Its sad that you praise a country that rates a movie "X" for kissing a breast and "R" for cutting it off with a chainsaw.<br/><br/>So check this series, its a breath of fresh air. Despite the interesting nature of this unique series, I cannot deny the despair disappointment and fear that I feel after watching each episode. For this reason I will characterize it by the word "impressive".<br/><br/>This show depicts a bitter, dark and scary picture of near future or even the present time.<br/><br/>It shows the dark and cruel aspect of over growing technology, media and globalizing social (virtual)media as it expands its shadow and run it's roots under the skin of our souls.<br/><br/>Aside from the strong acting, what adds to the brilliance of the stories, is keeping the audience excited and enthusiastic up to the very last few minutes of the each episode, before the real story unravels. Black Mirror is the most hard-hitting hypothetical on the psychological horror of unhampered technological advance I've ever seen... it reminds us that the potential side effects or opportunities for abuse are as limitless as human nature, and easily as devastating as biological tampering. Our current reckless obsession with pushing forward and rolling out new gadgets and systems without ANY thought for the potential consequences, combined with our smug self-assurance that technology is always beneficial to humanity is truly what makes this terrifying stuff. Guns in the hands of children. A brilliantly conceived and written show. I could not fault the acting, editing, camera-work, set pieces, soundtrack, scripting or effects. I honestly haven't been blown away by such a genius social commentary since... well forever. Do yourself a favour and watch them all. You may find yourself looking at your mobile phone with a strange sense of revulsion afterwards. Not to mention the internet. Several of the episodes contain interesting and enthralling plots, many of which are cleverly displayed, and include great acting to go along with that. My only issue is the endings. For me, this show would be my absolute favorite if some of the endings were tweaked. Episodes like "Playtest," "Shut Up And Dance," and "Hated In The Nation" had some of the best story lines, and to me, had the potential to be incredible episodes. They were original, and had likable characters, yet the endings made me angry. In "Playtest," it was just annoying that he died. Same with "Shut Up and Dance." Hector was very likable, Kenny, eh, but it just infuriated me when that the anonymous guy leaked the video after he had obeyed everything he had said. That totally ruined the episode for me. As for "Hated In The Nation," the fact that the bees killed 375,000 people made me very angry. They worked so hard to save individual people for most of the episode, and then the bees end up killing thousands. It was just a waste of time for me. I suppose these bothersome endings are intentional, for there were other annoying ones in other episodes as well. The show is still good despite this and I hope season four contains episodes with not so annoying endings. <br/><br/>The show is well thought out, well shot, and has great acting, so for that I give it and 8 out of 10 This anthology series is a great tribute to The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. I only started watching last week. My sister recommended it. And a great recommendation it was. This "Mini-seriesesque" show is from production companies Zeppotron and House of Tomorrow. The former, having many previous productions in British television.<br/><br/>On to the episodes, since these episodes are so diverse I will give a quick review of my 3 fave episodes:<br/><br/>Nosedive (S3 E1): Just because Dallas Price Howard is the lead (she is one of my favorite actresses) isn't the reason that this is one of my favorite episodes. One of my favorite things to do (as a past time) is to go through the massive amount of videos on Instagram. The premise of voting on people (or in Instagram's case liking things) is a power that while holds no substance can destroy a person's morale. We care more about what others think than what we think about ourselves. It's a little Psychology and a little philosophy. The acting in this was Awesome. The radical change of the lead character was real. The general idea of the tech was not something really futuristic but more like something that could actually happen in a few years, but like an app not mandatory in integrated into society. It was shot in South Africa and really made use of the rural S.A. locations.<br/><br/>An Entire History of You (S1 E3): No to be morbid in a sense, but have you ever had a memory you wish you could forget? Ever have a green-eyed monster thought? Well, in this ep they really took on the mind of a jealous person and forged it with technology that I believe would make anyone go nuts. Both Tobey Kobbell and tom Cullen played well as adversaries. The whole interview he had in the beginning did not connect well to the rest of the plot; I felt the first 5 mins could have really did something to connect me to his anger. The settings of modern furniture and the dinner party had an allure to it. This might be turned into a movie; rumors are Robert Downey Junior is going to produce. <br/><br/>Be Right Back (S2 E1): This ep takes us to the great obnoxious emotion of mourning. Hayley Atwell plays a grieving pregnant widow. She did a great job of relaying the intimate feeling of losing someone and then getting back just enough of them to not want them any more (if that makes sense.) This is a Strange place in the spectrum of sentiment and broke her at the end. Domhnall Gleasons portrayal as a composite reincarnation of him self was good but lacking some definiteness. I felt like the cake represented something. A relic mirage of pleasure.<br/><br/>Honorable Mentions: <br/><br/>Fifteen Million Merits (S1 E2) –Stationary biking all day is a terror in any dimension.<br/><br/>San Junipero (S3 E4) – That music though Walk Like an Egyptian  Heaven is a Place on Earth. Black Mirror is a fairly interesting show, I'll give it that. I made it through two seasons, and I'd probably continue watching if it weren't for the sex. I know there are a lot of people who like sex in their media. There are more that don't specifically like it, but don't mind it either. Personally, I find it offensive and distracting, whether it's gratuitous or whether it's important for the plot (I'd rather watch a plot for which sex wasn't important). Given, it isn't graphic and the show's not saturated with it, but it's in just about every episode, which for me pinpoints it as a series theme and a central interest for the writer.<br/><br/>Most will probably disagree with me. That's okay. I'm mainly just warning people who have tastes more like mine. There are good TV shows, great TV shows and then there is Black Mirror. I knew nothing about the show before getting into it and I am not a fan of horror, so I was skipping this every time it appeared on my Netflix watch-list, especially as it was giving the creepy vibes. But, how wrong was I!! This even remotely does not belong to the horror-genre.. I clicked play on Netflix and the first episode I ever watched was USS Calister (Netflix decided to automatically play the most recent season first even though I did not watch previous episodes!!), but a glad mistake, I was spellbound by the end of the it. It was everything for the "nerd" in me times 100!! There was cool tech, the mother, gripping story-line and homage to Star Trek, I was soo pleased by the end of it that I wanted to watch it again! <br/><br/>Then I read about the series and found of that the show was an anthology, mainly created by ITV and purchased by Netflix after they noted its brilliance. My binge-watching marathon commenced, right from the first episode of season one (you can watch it in any order, but if you want to see the evolution of a relatively low budget series into a Netflix extravaganza, I would recommend watching in the order which the show intended to) <br/><br/>The first episode with the UK Prime Minister and the pig was bizarre to say the least, still with brilliant writing but the second and third episodes were one of the best things I ever watched. Season 2 started with an amazing, heart-touching episode and then ends with a bang in the form of "White Christmas". This episode was screen-writing at its best and provides a very convincing/shocking premonition of what future tech will evolve into!<br/><br/>Season 3 and this is where you can see how Netflix millions manifest onto small screens. Brilliant episodes, one after the other and it is soo satisfying to binge-watch them! Season 4 continues the same theme of excellent episodes and ends with a bang in the form of "Metal Head" and "Black Museum"!! I wish Netflix announces season 5 soon as I simply cannot get enough of Black Mirror!! Do yourself a favour and do not miss this master-piece at any cost. It really is "worth" the Netflix subscription!<br/><br/>My Fave episode in chronological order:<br/><br/>Fifteen Million Merits: Amazing insight of the power of media plus the gorgeous-gorgeous Jessica Brown Findlay ...
The Entire History of You: I saw this episode thrice already. Without spoiling anything, this is Black Mirror at its best! ...
Be Right Back: This was heart-wrenching tale of star-crossed couple and a chance to re-live. ...
White Christmas: I though the best of the season was already episode 2, but we get 2 amazing ones here ...
Nosedive: Like, comment, share, thumbs-up .. what if your entire life was based on that!! Brilliant episode giving us a peak at the impact of social acceptance. ...
San Junipero: This should go down in the history as one of the best love stories. ...
Men Against Fire: Soldiers at war with very new high-tech vision, both sad and dangerous ...
Hated in the Nation: Simply wow!! Story of a sinister terrorising with high-tech flying things ;) ...
USS Callister: Live Long and ... have fun!! Plus very strong performance from the "Mother" (Cristin Milioti) ...
Arkangel: Helicopter-parenting .. how far would you go?? ...
Metalhead: Post-apocalyptic struggle for survival. Wish they make a movie out of this. ....
Black Museum: Very clever writing and amazing conclusion! ....<br/><br/>Weaknesses, well there are far and few, not every story's conclusion is satisfying. Sometimes, it leaves you wanting for a better closure. But that is a very minor issue. Just do not miss this show, you will be glad you didn't skip it. Black Mirror is a phenomenal TV series, but it's also deeply unsettling because it explores themes of brutality and humiliation in especially social media platforms, and often has an eerie invasive feel about it. However much it unsettles, it also challenges, so Black Mirror is often as repugnant as it is thought-provoking. Some episodes do indeed go too far and become expressions of anxiety, paranoia and shame rather than having a take-away. I would give Black Mirror 9/10 for that, but on the flip side some episodes can be uniquely transcendent so it is difficult to do that.<br/><br/>Black Mirror tackles ideas of cyber crime and the heartlessness that can happen from behind a screen. It talks about cell phone addiction and other kinds of benign-seeming uses of technology that can open the door to catastrophe when used in the wrong way. In particular Black Mirror tackles something we might call "outrage culture," as in the blacklisting of people we don't like. The themes of Black Mirror often do tie into modern day happenings, such as "canceling" someone like on Youtube. The series does give you a lot to think about, especially about the punishment of those who occupy a moral gray area.<br/><br/>While not always on its A game, Black Mirror has many gems, and is remarkably variable in its scope and in its tone. As others say, however, Black Mirror is hard to binge-watch because it can be unimaginably bleak, and often intentionally so. The series is rather traumatizing and difficult, but often the very bleakness can act as cautionary tales, and help you to be more empathetic and responsible when interacting with people online.<br/><br/>I hated Black Mirror, it was miserable, but also I think the series is better than most because there is a responsibility to it, and I do believe it doesn't try to condone its own blackheartedness. I do appreciate the substance of it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say I love Black Mirror, because it's terrifying and sometimes disgusting, but I do appreciate it and admire much of its efforts. One of my all time favorites. A dystopian and sometimes cruel series that makes you even uneasy every now and then. Creative, futuristic but in a modest way and absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>But what happened to season 5??? Out of nowhere it was there and all (first) three episodes were boring as hell! All of a sudden is was about creating profit and success. All of a sudden they needed (more ore less) famous 'actors' and singers like Miley Cyrus.. come on.. is this really the death of the series??? I loved all of the episodes thus far with the exception of the last one with Miley Cyrus. Her "tribute" (AKA hack) of NIN was sad. Reminds me of a few years back when she wanted a private audience with Radiohead, and they said "no thanks". Seems like they were trying to appeal to a different crowd. As I said before, sad... Loved every episode up to this one. Did MC beg to be on this brilliant show and they caved to her? Or was this just a bad episode in an otherwise brilliant show? I don't know, but for me, I was disappointed. Number 1 tv serial from my point of viewing. Each episode featuring different story lines about near future technology bad effect on our society.. I rated this show a 10, but without season 5... it's sad when a show this good goes bad. It was interesting and new, the concept and ideea was intriguing and thrilling to watch. Please bring back the old Black Mirror, i was looking forward to seeing the new season, but it's not worth it. Don't ruin it please, it was so good... we don't have much interesting shows to watch REVIEW FOR SEASON 5<br/><br/>Only three episodes for Season 5, makes me wonder if they blew most of their budget so they could get those big name stars. Each episode is more than an hour each, though, so watching the season is like watching a long 3-part movie.<br/><br/>The first one, "Striking Vipers" was basically "Brokeback Mountain" with black people, plus another twist. It showed how much worst Catfishing will be as technology improves.<br/><br/>The next one "Smithereens" was a mystery-tragedy, with the mystery being the why a guy had to kidnap an employee of a Social Media company, with the tragedy when we finally learned the reason why.<br/><br/>The last one, "Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too" was sort of an adventure thriller which also gave us a peek on how technology could affect the entertainment industry in the future.<br/><br/>In fairness, all the big name stars like Anthony Mackie, Topher Grace and Miley Cyrus did great in their episodes, and probably well worth their talent fees. A solid season, wished there were more episodes, though. There are so many gems in this series that its a clear 10/10 for me but in this review I would like to say a few words about season 5 only.<br/><br/>So Black Mirror has different directors and writers for every episode but
they have a few guide lines to follow and the most important thing is to feature
a futuristic AI somehow and let that play a major roll in the plot.<br/><br/>So the episode where the two straight guys hook up in virtual reality tries to
be politically correct but is just crinch worthy, they have an akward chemistry between them that makes this very rough to watch.
But mostly, it has very little to do with the futuristic AI, it's like they took an old
script and just modified it slightly to fit in to the Black Mirror guideline.
It was not an episode where you were left with a lot of cool questions like many of the other episodes.<br/><br/>The episode with Miley Cyrus was more like a feature movie for kids. It gave me nothing. The acting is alright, the picture is great but it's just boring. Again, this script could have been something old and dusty that they just adapted for Black Mirror rather than in Season 1 where they all felt connected. I say Bah!<br/><br/>Lastly the episode with the guy who screwed up his life completely.
Now this episode is worthy of Black Mirror. It's the same untold story that unfold like leaves of a flower which is great. The only critique I would give it is that it had NOTHING to do with futuristic AI. Too check your smart phone for crap while driving is a thing today and has been for years so what is your point here? Don't try to sell us old garbage, give us new written stuff. Great series ever. Recommend for who love of the idea of the technology and future world. Very genius series, u can't watch it continuously episode after episode, u need to stop for hours or days sometimes to think about what u watched.<br/><br/>Really excellent work 👍🏻 Black Mirror is, first of all, SF (this is for all of the other reviewers saying that it s unrealistic). Second, the episodes are not made or thought to be masterpieces by their acting or dialogs or even effects . They catch the simplicity of a normal lifetime moment but with the dark immersion of future(maybe!) technology. It's the underlined ideas that are important here. All the other elements are basic ON PORPOISE so you can focus on all the consequences our future choices can bring. And to be honest, where in the world have you seen full on perfectly serious played drama with mindblown visual and whatever effects for a SATYR!?.
Last but not least, some of the actions of the humanity are disgusting, horrific, and repulsive. Some is a way too small and insignificant word for this actually. I don't understand how SOME of you are so surprised.<br/><br/>All in all, whoever's reading this, i advice you to give it a try if this is what you were willing to do and please, watch more than 1 episode. If you ask me, start with White Christmas (episodes are individual). This show is fantastic. Really well thought out way of showing tech in the near to far future. I love it and im a tech fanatic. Well worth the watch! I think calling Black Mirror SciFi is a bit offensive but technically it is indeed made of fictional stories on how science may evolve.<br/><br/>Unlike other shows, this is essentially a collection of short movies, but each one succeeds in being very compelling, thought provoking and often has a thriler edge to it.<br/><br/>So it is a drama, thriller and satire all rolled into one. Which is what it makes it so good.<br/><br/>Basically Black Mirror premise is to dive into (very plausible) scenarios into where technological progress may lead us if we are not careful, and just how f-ed of a world we may end up with it.<br/><br/>Would recommend watching all of the episodes, and it is a perfect show to watch if you feel like watching something but maybe do not have time to watch a movie, while still getting that beggining, middle and end feeling - and most likely will be very philosophical after that.<br/><br/>Strong 9/10 They say ''ignorance is a bliss'', what if we show you what you have ignored? this is basically the theme of black mirror, it describes the bitter truth of life. I promise you...if this show doesn't make you depressed, then i don't know what else will do. Can't remember any other show left me so speechless like this one. There are many great shows, but this one...every single episode left me overwhelmed with various emotions, every episode in it's unique way with unique story. I really can not describe content, story, hidden message or characters with just words, I can only scream PLEASE WATCH THIS! Sometimes beginning of episodes may seem boring or dull, with slow developing story, but in the end every single episode gives you sucker punch that leaves you speechless.<br/><br/>WATCH! WATCH! WATCH! Well, at first I'm delighted the series consists of single episodes. Every episode is totally different, though the main theme is the disadvantages of technologie in the nearby future. Some of these episodes are great, others a bit boring. But still, this is just my opinion. To find out which episode suits you, just watch it! The fourth season of Black Mirror manages to keeep terrifying its viewers with the similar horrors from the last season. All six stories are interesting and engaging, but some stories might get lost by the end of the episodes. Overall, a very well done season. I request the makers to please make more episodes. What the hell how come they think like that. Such a original thinking. Just hands off to you guys. 
Every episode is a journey starting slowly and then getting pace. 
No living person should miss it. 
Thanks 
Rahul Lakra Just finished binge watching all 4 seasons. I will admit the first episode threw me a bit, like what the hell is this? Humiliation involving bestiality. All I could think of was, that poor pig. Watched the next one and thought I wouldn't watch anymore after that. Then I saw episode 3. The emotion was so raw, I was hooked. The husbands obsession and playing every memory back repeatedly looking for clues, I felt sorry for him. There were only a couple episodes that were just ok. It's scary to think this could be the future. Makes me think every time I use my phone or social media. How invasive to have someone legally see your memories. Black Mirror was not a let down. My advice keep watching, don't give up after the pig! Egotistical maniac brings innocent people into his game. Brings them into his game to better 1 small part of his life. Not considering the torture and his reality theyd be stuck in. <br/><br/>..but in the end you almost feel bad for him. Impossible to wake up stuck in a non existent reality. At least it's not a true story or you'd really feel bad for the dude.<br/><br/>But you can't torture people and just expect them to sit back and take it. Eventually someone has to over throw the sadistic programmer. :) 1/1/18. Have seen all 4 seasons of this technology-based series. Overall it's pretty good. However, I loved San Junipero the best. Almost didn't get through the first season without watching several episodes again. The seasons have gotten better, so that I liked more episodes than not. Season 4 was probably the best, in which I liked 4 out of 6. There is no continuity, so each episode pretty much stands on its own and requires you to start all over again. Like Twilight Zone, but the episodes are longer. Black mirror is SUCH a good a show and a definite must watch. Every episode is different. I love this show and have loved it since it first came out it's just so upsetting when you wait so long for a new season and there are only 3 episodes!! I just want there to be more. I really reccomed you check out this show! Well, it's not news that until the 3nd season this show was more than worth it the watch, even if i didn't really enjoy all episodes, the majority of them were pretty good. then the 4 season came around, and only 1/2 eps were actually good but even then, it didn't see like black mirror had lost itself but boy, it really did, and the 5 season just put that in our faces. When i finish the season, my first thought was "well maybe black mirror should be cancelled" I wasn't excited for more, I didn't want more of it, I just thought it was time to stop. It's cleary that they don't know what to do with this anymore, and they surely run out of good ideas to episodes, so it's for the best if we just let it go for it's own good, you need to know when it's time to stop. After some episodes, which was just stupid, I planned to rate it with 1 star. But when I increase engagement , I found that it was not so bad what I thought in previous. So rated it with an average. Liked it. All the best to the director. Disturbing, real and mind blowing.
Some episodes were not executed in a proper way.
But overall, the concept is good and it's worth watching. Black Mirror is an inspiring, thought provoking, thrilling and stunning TV series about how technology affects human behavior and psychology. Each and every episode is different from each other but are connected with one thing i.e. technology. It's a must watch for every human being( Except for S05 E03 which is cringy as hell.....:( ) Here's how to watch Black Mirror if you want to check out the best episodes first:<br/><br/><ul><li>Watch White Christmas to see if you like the show</li><li>If so, watch all of Season 3</li><li>If still hooked, check out Bandersnatch</li><li>The first and last episodes of Season 4 would be good to watch next</li><li>Then watch Season 2</li><li>Then watch the rest</li></ul> It has very interesting first episodes, sketching the nearest future with amazing new technologies/ life. It was sci-fi suspense.
But the further the episodes the more gory / horror-like it became: gory hysterical horror with a scent of a future; instead of initial nearest future sci-fi suspense / drama.
Please return to the original start. I started watching Black Mirror because of all the hype and the high ratings. About 20 minutes into the first episode I decided to not waste any more time on it. I honestly do not understand the hype. This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Not to forget it is also one of the most disturbing shows I have ever seen. Do people really find this entertaining? Once the pig was mentioned in the first episode I was done. What kind of sick and disgusting mind would enjoy watching such a thing? This is one of the worst shows on television and it doesn't deserve an 8.9 rating. There are so many great TV shows out there that have a much lower rating than a show like this. I guess I do not understand general public opinion. Wow, i expected nothing...and i literally got nothing. I have truly no idea why anyone would watch this. Nothing more to say. The whole point of dystopia and sci-fi is to make it believable. The only dystopic thing about BlackMirror is it has a rating of 8,9 on this website which means our population is not getting any smarter.<br/><br/>The writer is very creative, but knows way less about technology or politics or the world than the average teenager. And is probably a hopeless social struggle junkie who blames the problems of the world on consumerism.<br/><br/>The only episode I enjoyed was the prime minister shagging a piggy, but it still lead nowhere. It was just a spark of creativity (the kind that emerges from getting high with your highschool friends), without any decent support. The best series ever made in history which covers all the aspects of modern human life with a creative and brand new point of view. I highly recommend every one to watch it ASAP!

Then the slow pace, the useless dumb side stories with some morality background, then the un-realatable cast, with the ugliest people you could see cast in movies. British series to their best - great idea and zero finalisation. This is actually very well Directed and made
great acting and superb cinematography
Terribly DISTURBING stories made by mentally sick people ruined all the great work was put into this.
I've never thought about it before but movies and shows creators should comply to mental test before publishing their work. Thing that strikes me about this show is that everything they show in every episode is possible in real life... the technology and the outcomes etc<br/><br/>Mind blowing and I think educational. Black Mirror is a British anthology series created by Charlie Brooker. While each episode presents a different world with different characters, all of them have a common underlying theme - the dark side of technology. In this review, I am going to discuss aspects of this TV series that makes it my favorite of all time.
Firstly, the show has the ability of presenting a very depressing, dystopian world that could actually happen in present time. This aspect makes the viewing experience much more terrifying. The characters presented are also three-dimensional and have a lot of nuance on them. This makes the audiences care and feel invested on them. Moreover, the high production values adds an extra layer of realism to the world since it looks very realistic. Additionally, the stories teaches a lot of moral lessons that audiences can learn. Last but not least, the great cinematography presents a visceral experience as every shot is composed beautifully, with a slow creeping camera movement and many wide shots.
It is a revolutionary piece of television that will stand the test of time and be remembered years from now. Black Mirror has been for me one of the highlights in drama over the last decade. Imaginative, dark, bleak, often cynical, but always absorbing, incredible viewing. What I wouldn't give to sit down and talk with Charlie Brooker, to find out where his ideas come from, and what plans he has for the future of the show. The more bleak they are, the more I tend to enjoy them, and the more an episode has that feeling of 'well that could really happen,' the more I love them still. I will admit I feared when the Channel Four arrangement ended, The Americanisation of the show did worry me a lot, but how wrong was I. The show has definitely changed, and improved for my money, episodes like Playtest and Metalhead are downright scary, while episodes like Hang the DJ and San Junipero tug at the heart strings. How on Earth do you pick a favourite episode, so many outstanding contenders, a few of the best include White Christmas and San Junipero, but the variety is so rich everybody will have a different favourite. I can't wait to see more in the future, Please Charlie :-) ** Some political correctness and some identity politcs, especially in later episodes **<br/><br/>The first 3 1/2 seasons of Black Mirror are fairly consistently brilliant. Many of the other reviews here capture the cleverness of the series.<br/><br/>However, the last 1 1/2 series have succumbed to identity politics. It's sad to see such a powerful writer and executive producer stumble and fall into post modernism. You will see a sudden influx of unrealistic, dislikeable female characters. In particular, the episode "Hated in the Nation" is doused in political correctness, nauseatingly so.<br/><br/>Is this simply a case of being upset with female characters? Not at all. Prior to the political correctness dousing, the female characters were natural and realistic, capable and vulnerable. After this, I predicted that the "female hacker" in "Hates in the Nation" would outsmart every male hacker within seconds because "she's female". You will see a consistent theme of imasculation of male characters and hyper masculinisation of female characters. From a show that aims to reflect reality, it's such a disappointment that it falls into these shallow stereotypes.<br/><br/>Let's hope the writers don't follow the path of Season 4 of Sherlock Holmes. Can the writers turn back to realistic, relatable female characters? Once you head down this path, writers rarely recover. Realism loses out. The edginess of season 1 is unlikely to be seen again, unless the show heads to extreme political correctness. Season 1 of Britain's "Black Mirror" (2011) was absolutely terrific. (To be clear, this first "season" consists of only three episodes, although subsequent seasons have more.) This looks to be a truly superb dystopian science fiction anthology series — I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>I'd point to two qualities that make this show stellar. First, it's truly smart stuff. The story devices are thoughtfully invented and quite original. (These are "near-future" -type sci-fi tales depicting how new technology or cultural trends can have unforeseen consequences.) This show doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence, it relies on him or her to pay attention and think.<br/><br/>Second, the writers here have a firm grasp of genuine psychological horror. There are no radioactive monsters in the sewers here, or killer robots from the future — but "Black Mirror" manages to be scary without those things. It does just fine presenting the viewer with visions of human shame, fear, jealousy or existential loss. These are stories that deal primarily with the psychology of their characters — and they truly get under your skin.<br/><br/>This is great stuff — I'd recommend it. Why are you wasting time reading reviews? Just go watch it. It's brilliant. You may want to skip the first episode as it is very inferior to every other one. On the other hand, they just keep getting better, so you may as well watch it, and keep getting surprised. I just don't want you to see the first one, and think it's not any good. Here is what you need to know. This show will make you think. It has some futuristic science fiction very well done (I am a futures studies author, so trust me on this). The name black mirror means that it shows you some very dark aspects about our society. Problem is that they are not so far fetched and you will relate to some of them. Every episode is unrelated, so that thing I talked earlier about the first one not being very good, is not a problem. I cannot understand that this series has been voted so high. If I could vote with 0, I would. You should be warned that it contains awful scenes that a lot of people would not like to see or even think about. This should also be written in the episode description. Not that you don't know what to expect and waste your time on episodes that you absolutely don't want to see. Trying so badly to film something different has (in my opinion) crossed all the lines. I have watched only the 1st episode and this was also the last. I cannot even find words to describe how disturbing it was. I've lost 45 minutes of my time to watch this.... I only seen it cuz. It has the girl from black panther. And famous people and Peggy Carter lol It's stark, chilling, funny, acerbic, gut wrenching, thought provoking and complex. There are some duds, (like the waldo moment and the miley Cyrus episode) but the majority are superb. The entire history of you and fifteen million credits in particular stayed with me for days, as well as white Christmas. I genuinely wanted to quit my phone, sell my stuff and move off grid after watching a few of them, but like everyone else im hopelessly addicted. Which is the point brookers trying to make.The stories are wonderfully intricate and multi faceted and offer a stark glimpse into our futures. Be right back was devastating to watch, as my husband died 15 years ago, and goodness..that one hurt to watch. But its not all sad and gloomy, hang the dj and uss callister are more uplifting. I watched them from season 5 to 1 (just because) and it was interesting to see the budget diminish, along with some pretty sweet cgi, but even the first season worked well without it. I really hope it doesn't lose it's originality and penchant to..well, mirror us, for the sake of big named stars becoming involved. Not even telling you what this shows about. Get it watched. If you don't like it you're an idiot. FACT! Love this! really good entertainment!
Although, it might keep you awake at night... watching just one more episode. Just one more... Total nonsense... the first seasons were ok but the last one is intellectually very very poor. Black mirror was the most interesting show out there the first 4 seasons, then... i dont know what happened but season 5 is an insult, a tragedy. it s*cks big time!! I love Black Mirror. Its been one of the best shows on TV since it began. (Can we call it TV now?) Not every episode is perfect. But its always entertaining and thought provoking. Its never lazy or formulaic. Its always imaginative and provocative.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is that it seems people are quite down on Season 5 and I don't get why. Sure, I would not say any of them are as good as the very best episodes like San Junipero, White Christmas, Shut Up and Dance etc. But also I wouldn't say any of them are as bad as the worst.<br/><br/>Smithereens was the best of the three IMO. Andrew Scott was superb as always. And the story was heart-wrenching. But its the Miley Cyrus episode that seems to be coming under fire the most. Now I'm no Miley fan, but I thought she equipped herself well in this and was perfectly cast. One thing people seem to be saying is that this episode 'Rachel, Jake and Ashley Too' was cliche and a trite portrayal of the music business. All I would say to that (and I work in the music business), is that those criticisms come from people who have forgotten the idea of a metaphor. Yes, if the story was just saying Rock is real and Pop is contrived then that would be both a lazy cliche and inaccurate. But to assume that you would have to ignore that Charlie Brooker is never that simplistic and never that lazy as a writer. So think harder, dig deeper and perhaps you will find more than meets the eye. This series is not, never has been nor never will be for lazy viewers. Black Mirror is a pretty good show. It's interesting enough, but I don't think it's near as great as everyone says it is. My favorite episode is Hang the DJ. Heard so much praise about Black Mirror that my partner and I decided to give it a go. First episode was a shock to say the least, but not necessarily bad. Admittedly I did feel queasy when the Prime Minister had to have sex with a pig.. Otherwise, it definitely draws you in. Second episode was okay but dragged on and was too paranoid.<br/><br/>The show has has a preachy, prententious tone to it that takes a paranoid view at how technology is affecting society; making people selfish, antisocial robots. Surely tech is bringing advantages to the future, along with it's negatives?<br/><br/>Maybe you're meant to see the show in a more "arty", metaphorical light- but even so the point of the story does drag on pessimisticly. <br/><br/>Overall: if you want something dark and slightly different to the usual, the first two episodes are okay. Otherwise, it'll just leave you feeling depressed and bored. A show that is shocking, emotional, disturbing, and entertaining at the same time. Some episodes may go a bit too far for some teenagers, so they may not be ready yet. Adults should be fine watching it if they are okay with shocking films. The Twilight Zone had episodes of charm and sweetness beneath the weirdness. Black Mirror is just relentlessly grim, and not in a great way. I get it: technology is alienating. Yawn After my cousin and cousin-in-law showed genuine freaked-outness and enthusiasm about these series I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>The series is indeed quite original. And the fact that all the episodes deal with some negative side-effect from technology makes it relevant. <br/><br/>But even though I definitely believe the technological possibilities proposed in the episodes, I certainly can't believe the human aspect. The behavior of the characters is farfetched, unbelievable. Exactly in that sense: I don't believe them.<br/><br/>I guess this would categorise the series as 'horror', scary things happen and the characters overreact and do silly things, things that people wouldn't do in reality. And there's the snag for me: the series seems to want to use something from reality, technology, to scare us, yet fails to do so because of the characters' responses. <br/><br/>There also is a strange focus on certain themes that seem to be the biggest horror to the creators of the show, and they are usually very sexual. Mostly men having to deal with the woman they love not having sex with them.<br/><br/>I'd like to see this show grow. I'd like it to become more 'thriller' instead of 'horror'. I want to actually believe these things could happen. Well... only for an hour or so ;) 
I'd like to see this show grow and create storylines that involve more variant fears, and I can see they seem to be doing this. Hear, hear!<br/><br/>So yes, please, go on. I cant' wait for the creators to really scare me silly... in the future. Just watched a few episodes in the earlier seasons. This show is made for minds that are sick. Just leaves one feeling depressed. Obviously the creators are emotionally disturbed as well as all those that watch it. Waste of time. If I want to be mentally challenged I watch philosophy.<br/><br/>It's fun to portray Alzheimer's until someone in you family has it. The American public likes these type of shows because they never have witnessed true injustice.<br/><br/>The episode with the Star Trek theme was probably the worst. How are you gonna have consecutive bad endings just to have a CTO be mentally disabled? Those video game characters should have suffered. He's been bullied his whole life, and he deserves the punishment? Ow, and way to rely on the fact that men will fall for anything as long as a woman is shirtless. Disgusting stereotypical show. I wish I could rate it -10000.<br/><br/>So unfulfilling! I have watched White Christmas.<br/><br/>The high rated episode of Black Mirror.<br/><br/>And to say the least. It was stupid.<br/><br/>The premise was good. Creating a digital copy of your own mind.<br/><br/>But, what surrounded was nothing less of stupidity. <br/><br/>And Blocking people. This concept is not good. I mean, you are free enough to kill someone but, you can't see them. What the hell you were smoking. <br/><br/>The creator of this show most likely want to introduce good ideas to audience but, what are you going to do next. <br/><br/>This show is more like Horror without supernatural but with science fiction. <br/><br/>I can understand why people will like it and why it will have such high rating on IMDb. <br/><br/>But, for me the story and this show is not smart enough. <br/><br/>Nor does it tries to be. <br/><br/>So, I think I am not their targeted audience. <br/><br/>I didn't like Dexter for the same reason. It was slow and stupid.<br/><br/>I like Prison Brake First season. Till it start getting stupid.<br/><br/>It is impossible to watch Fourth season without vomiting. <br/><br/>But, even after all this I really like Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>And were was I. <br/><br/>Yes, Black Mirror. <br/><br/>People who like to watch Horror movie.<br/><br/>Will most likely love this show. <br/><br/>I don't know why I never liked a single horror movie. <br/><br/>Except may be Death note. <br/><br/>Horror is added in it's Genera. <br/><br/>But it's great. I was barely able to make it through the first season. This show is super boring and not at all interesting. The real struggle of this show is staying awake. Maybe it is the whole society, but what is the thing with the humanities seeing disaster in every advancement? Just because it might sell better is not an argument, as variety also sells. Is it because the ones who end up in humanities, as opposed to sciences are not only usually less intelligent, but also start up in fields that pay far worse. So anything that reinforces their obsolescence in the work market only reinforces the Christian mythology about the end of days.<br/><br/>The series is unpleasant in taking the ugly side of tech, in an unimaginative context. Take the first episode. People can see in a virtual reality hints from their smart phones. Yet they still need a big screen just like the young screen writer envied the people having big screen macs back in the day. The technology seemingly surpassed the need for a screen - see the brother emerged in virtual reality - yet the writer can't possibly understand that. Or when Tesla cars can drive themselves, in this alternative near future the Taxi is a Taxi and not some sort of Uber and has a driver too! So much for visionary.<br/><br/>Yes, the phones should have been different, but the catalyst of the unimaginative writer incapable to get a science diploma is precisely his fear of a smart phone like the iPhone. And the fear is palpable, after all the screen writer probably has a hard time understanding that the Russian girl who keeps writing is a scam as the Nigerian prince. And jumping from email to enhanced reality is quite a jump for a frail mind.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch The writing in this show is outstanding you can tell they are careful with details and if you re watch a episode you will see the little things the characters say to make sure the story is clear and point in a certain direction and because the writers are so good at turning your head to one part of the story, you realize that everything you knew was about the current plot has changed into a new meaning. i know this sounds weird but the stories are amazing. I binged watched this so much while my relationship was on the edge AND MY GIRLFRIEND LEFT ME. but its okay because i sorta feel like this is worth it lol this show needs to be more recognized. This show believes it's the smartest thing in the world with their bland and blatant criticism of society. Probably the most pretentious piece of media I've ever had the disgrace of watching, I wish more people realized that this is just some smart wannabe crap I don't get the high reviews for this. The overall concept is cool, I'll give it that, but the delivery is quite poor. The acting is ungodly awful (even actors who are otherwise decent do a terrible job in this series), and it is so sloooooow. Black mirror is the biggest waste of my life yet. I Enjoyed maybe 1 episode per season. The concepts are incredibly well thought out but wasted on bad plot lines. Watched this show to see what the hype was all about, now I will tell people not to bother. There are flaws yes and strange casting choices. I enjoyed this season. I would of liked maybe 2-3 more episodes with some more variety mixed in, but all in all it was Black Mirror.
For those who are annoyed at a certain episode, try and look at the deeper meaning. Didn't care for the first 3 episodes but it gets better with episodes 4, 5 and 6. I give the whole season a 6 minus.<br/><br/><ul><li>episode 1 is about social media. I absolutely hated it. Community did way better with a lot more satire in the 8th episode "App Development and Condiments" of season 5. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>episode 2 didn't feel like a black mirror episode and the lead is so annoying it's painful to watch.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>episode 3 is not subversive, not new and pretty boring </li></ul><br/><br/>Then things start to get better with episode 4 and finished grandiosely with features length episode 5. <br/><br/>TL;DR : skip episode 1-3 and watch'em letter if you get bored. It is appeared to be up on the scale of perfection, isn't it? But it became kind of a thing in the movies/series industry. This glitter that make you feel like it suppose to be within the 'quality' rankings. Actually this is kind of similar to the general idea of 'Black Mirror'. I have to be honest, it is pretty hard to stand here and say "it is not good TV".<br/><br/>I did fall in love with the idea of the memory cheap, I think that this one is very reflective to the general idea of this series, and it implements it pretty well. It is not entirely out of the reality to say that we could fall for this one. The possibility of seeing time, back and forward, seems pretty functional. More than that it is not very far of what we have now.<br/><br/>My primer issue with the series is the fact that in my opinion it is a bit too judgmental. Too subjective. Also, I find it degrading the human kind, not very sensitive to realistic human needs, such as real person to person relationship. I always believed that technology can hypnotize one, and blur our senses with it's presumably perfection. But assuming that a person would alternate human relations for machine, is a huge clichÃ©'.<br/><br/>I also find it a bit exaggerating with our technology possibilities, but this is not the case for criticizing here, since you can never know, and that is why science fiction is here for.<br/><br/>Some of the characters were seem to be a bit too edgy between good and evil, such as the judges in the singing contest. At first I though maybe it's suppose to be an exaggeration of the situation with a taste of symbolism, but the endings made it clear for me that it was suppose to demonstrate a realistic future story.<br/><br/>We don't need to go too far to speculate what will happen if we'll keep on running with the current technology, the present reflects quite well the disadvantages of advances, we can just look around. Just need good pair of eyes for that.... probably a small use of the brain would be necessary as well.<br/><br/>I am very sensitive about this subject, because I believe with all my hurt in self limiting of technology to prevent this culture of running after transparent satisfactions. Season 5 is not my cup of tea the latest seasons were great ...Alfred Hitchcock, The X-files, or Fringe. I cannot add too much to all the other stellar reviews. This series popped up on Netflix and, after the first wild & crazy episode, I binged. Writing: incredible! The scripts are in the realm of J.J. Abrams quality with serious development evident and fine tuning obvious; crafted. Charlie Brooker is genius. Directing: the type of emotion and passion pulled from every single actor is just incredible; camera work seamless. Consider that each of the original six episodes were directed uniquely, the result across the series is a real achievement. Acting: take episode one's PM: Rory Kinnear playing the part of Michael Callow. He hit the mark so fantastically, and on top of that the supporting cast in that same episode all conveyed such incredible feeling. Empathy was basically thrown at you through their eyes - extras included. There were so many great performances, but one in particular by Lenora Crichlow as Victoria Skillane in episode six, deserves mention. As the primary character with complete focus throughout, her efforts were Emmy worthy. Summary: so surprisingly good I was truly blown away. A series like this does not come about often. I hope you enjoy it as much as so many others have. Latest seasons worst and worst.<br/><br/>While first 2 and some of s3 had great episodes, particularly liked the girl obsessed with likes (Nosedive) and Men against fire (perfect analogy of brain washed soldiers in Iraq), the last 2 seasons quite poor.<br/><br/>Just watched striking vipers, predictable, boring and unrealistic Since The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone, and other anthology series have been off the air for a long time (heck, I'll even include Are You Afraid of the Dark? and The Hitchhiker in there), this is definitely the best anthology series the world currently has. Even if there were others, this would probably be at the top of the list, however.<br/><br/>I hope this show never ends, and I think Netflix should aim for Black Mirror being the longest running anthology series to date. I know we'd like them to keep making it -- pretty much everyone I know loves this show.<br/><br/>Update: The writers (along with everyone else) of this show are doing a great job. Hope future seasons are as good as the current ones, especially the first three of season 5. 4 Seasons. 19 different sessions of mental trauma. 
Black Mirror is 10 times terrifying than the best horror movie ever. It is disturbing to even think about the scenarios presented in each episode. The TV series themes the fatal attraction between human and technology. Black Mirror stories happen in a dystopian society which is soon going to be a reality for many of us. The show instills fear about the future we're moving into. As the makers expressed, this show is certainly not for the faint-hearted. The series starts with a pretty disturbing first episode but it gets better with each episode. The special appearances by actors and early career roles for actors in the series is great as well. Watch it and you most likely won't regret it. Pretty good overall!! Some episodes are just mind blowing & amazing!! Love it! I rated this 10/10 because its the best show I have ever watched. I've never seen anything like it, seriously. When you explain to someone that the theme of this show is generally technology it sounds pretty boring, but trust me this is the most original and mind blowing show ever. Of course it has some good episodes, some bad ones (very few) and some INCREDIBLE ones. Personally my favourites are (in order): Shut up and dance, White christmas and Hang the dj. I love that they are all independent and different themed episodes. Of course, if you dont like weird things you will find this show quite disturbing because it is very explicit. For those who like weird, enjoy!!! The best series I've seen this year! Really looking forward to the next episodes! Definitely waiting for more! had a great suspense and good way of connecting episodes in last episode of season 4 I'm writing this review after watching National Anthem and White Christmas. OK, so National Anthem is the first episode and for me it felt like the dirty joke that a stand-up comedian would start his routine with (crude and in your face - just to select the audience and make it more receptive to the following jokes). My opinion at the end of the episode - very well crafted but definitely SOULLESS. I decided to not watch another episode of Black Mirror. So this friend of mine tells me to watch White Christmas because this is the best episode. Broke my promise and watched it. Definitely a step up in ingenuity, however I have the same problem with the LACK OF SOUL of this show. Personally I don't think I'll ever watch another episode of Black Mirror. Bottom line if you want an ingenious type of show that is basically devoid of any type of empathy and all around SOUL - then maybe this is for you - you will probably enjoy the cold and dark ideas of this show. However if you are looking for at least one idea / character that you can be empathic with, then maybe this is not for you. If your woke and know nothing of entertainment. Then go watch this show. It's polictical and tells you that all men are not good.
I tied to like it, a lot of bad actor's, poor writing and the plots make no sence. From day one of this it screams Woke. I somehow managed to make it about 30 minutes into the first episode, but I have to turn it off because I can't take anymore. It's extremely sad that our society is giving crap like this such high ratings. It almost resembles a Star Trek parody outfits and all. I am not a Star Trek fan at all, but it is 1000 times better than this. All of the positive reviews must be for a different show because this one is nothing like people are claiming. I'm at a loss for words how bad this actually is. I couldn't stop watching the show as soon as I put the first episode on.
Scary to think what the future would hold for mankind if any of the episodes would correctly predict it But the non netflix seasons are very good, they are dark, distopian. Netflix season is shallow, dumb, doesen't presents wide range problems of tech, doesn't induce the viewer to think and fear the future. Very disappointing. Maybe I'm "binged our" , but the 1st episode of the fifth season is dumb. This is great show, but without season 5.<br/><br/>Season 5 is comedy. Definitely worth seeing! Definitely brilliant..definitely touching...the show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature..The stories are mostly set in a world that is badly influenced by modern technology. What makes "Black mirror" special ?!..'Details' , great filming,acting,directing ...asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing ðŸ‘Œ I don't know who had the original idea for this, but I want some of what he/she had....
What a concept.. Excellent story-lines, great acting, great direction, great production.. !!
If you haven't watched it yet.. Just start.. Like, NOW!<br/><br/>PS: The first episode is not indicative at all for what follows on the rest of the seasons, so don't dismiss it before you have another go. Not that it's bad, but as I said. Not indicative. This was a great show, first 3 seasons was excellent. But like all other series, when it joined netflix, it was going downhill, and it is going fast, it is now losing one star with each terrible iteration. OK- I wouldn't rate alle the parts with 9 stars, but most of them. Scary science fiction that is a good critique of the dark side of modern scientific advances that are changing our society or about to change it. The series have a lot of good actors but the action is just BORING some times!
Some episodes are just masterpieces but the most are just boring! Hard Hitting! This is the perfect example of the future of humanity. Every episode is superb. I want to salute the writers of this series. My favorite season is season 3 (Nosedive, hated by nation, and men against fire). ....this enough. Each episode is better, and more surprising, than the one before. Does it tend to caution regards technology? Yes...and it SHOULD...we don't want Idiocracy to become prophecy. Very brilliant from charlie brooker !
Totally recommand it Each and every episode is a masterpiece, written to perfection. Every viewer will feel something different from what episode they've just watched. I know that after most episodes I feel a little frightened for my children as I am fully aware of what the future is bringing. This series is a collection of individual stories so giving it a rating is kind of an average of all of the episodes. The majority of them were outstanding. Quality writing and acting and great stories that were inventive and I was honestly glued to the screen for several of them. Out of the five seasons that I watched, there are a few duds but none are as bad as Netflix's new sci-fi series "another life". That's the worst show I've ever seen. Cleverly put together by making good use of the horror that modern technology and social media can be. Just like the old Twilight Zone series of the 80s, this series give the same creepiness and mystery. This show was recommended to me by my NYU graduate brother for Film. He produces commercial film. Every time he recommends some show or movie or mentions it, I check it out and this one was just so unexpected. This is meant for high iq people or people with a higher illuminated intellect. If not you will not understand it or understand why it has such high ratings. If you don't know if you have the intellect to watch the show, watch the first episode & then continue to the 2nd. You will see 2 drastic changes in between the two. If you understand after episode 2-3 what is going on, then you're stuck on this and now have been enlightened. Good luck on the binge then waiting a year for 3 episodes like the rest of us. - OG IMDb User reviewer. Perhaps the best TV Show that will be for a long time. From "Be Right Back" to "Smithereens" to "White Christmas" - every episode was a learning experience along with thrilling dramas and story lines. Very evoking, mind boggling. This must be watched. The biggest problems with black mirror are similar to a show like The Twilight Zone. Making a show where each episode is different from the next can result in a mixed bag of quality.
Seriously though black mirror is great because when it gets its satire right, it is truly unforgettable. I can't stop thinking about the Christmas special because of its fantastic ending. There are duds in this shows run obviously, but they aren't awful episodes. It's a strong show and there is not much more I can say<br/><br/>
Also watch bandersnatch You know when you get a great steak? So you go back to the restaurant and order it again. Well it ain't easy getting it right every-time..<br/><br/>Black mirror started out as a low budget channel 4 UK gig and picked up a fanbase so the USA took it forward. To their credit the bigger budgets delivered greater productions. The whole things a great watch. Series 5. Well its stumbling a little. First one out wasnt great the next was good and the third with miley cyrus got mixed reviews. I liked that one the most. Overall if your a scifi fantasy type of lover your at the right gig. 9/10 As far as Netflix content is concerned, this show is a must watch. Some of the episodes, particularly the first 3 seasons, are intriguing and worthy of it's fame. Howewer, things seemed to go a bit off-track in the last 2 seasons which I felt was a total letdown. Barring those few episodes, this is most certainly a compelling watch. And I would say it could reach greater heights if they stick to the original premise. Needless to say, it is well directed coupled with some commendable acting. You just need to check out the best episodes and then give it a shot. There isn't much to say about it. Season 1 started off nicely, season 2-4 blew my mind with great episodes and some decent ones. Season 5 is a letdown, since there it lost the feeling of what Black Mirror is in all the other seasons. The best episodes of Black Mirror are worth the time investment. It is cleverly written and well-executed. I think all the episodes are worth checking out, despite the fact that they don't all excel. Season 5 Episode 1: What a waste. The whole problem with this episode was it's lack of believability. It opens with a group of roommates in a club having fun 3 minutes later it's revealed that Anthony Mackie and Nichole Baharie are lovers. Jump forward what appears to be at least 5 years. They are married and celebrating his birthday. The other roommate Yahya Abdul-Mateen II shows up to present Mackie with a virtual reality game device and game. That night they play said game only to have sex. Where did that even come from? No hints at unrequited love between Mackie and Mateen. Most friends/roommates don't immediately try to have sex after years of being apart when there was no sign of lust/love between them.
Season 5 Episode 2: I won't ruin this with spoilers. The only redeeming episode from the season. Andrew Scott ( a highly underrated actor in my opinion) plays a character just drifting through life after the death of his fiancée carrying a grudge for a social media site. Truly the highlight of season 5 thus far. A must watch.
Season 5 Episode 3. Miley Cyrus stars as a bubblegum pop star hiding her own personal angst. What appears to be an attempt to come off as a warning of not to judge a book by its cover falls flat. Weak backstory let's this episode just languish in its own mediocrity. Basically another teen "drama" that wouldn't have made it into any other entertainment platform except Netflix.
Personally I've loved this show until this season except episode 2( really great). Hopefully more episodes will be made that go back to the type of writing that previous episodes had. Better known actors can't help the show if all they have are weak scripts I can't describe this show with a few word , but i can say it's one of the best i've ever seen It is amazing, everyone should watch it. But actually San Junipero was the best thing i ve ever seen.Heaven is a place on earth Indeed!
xx It's basically a tv show in which nothing goes out well in the end. This series is very well written and extremely unique in its ideas. It explores the dark side of humanity and technology through each episode which features a stand alone story. If you were a fan of the Twilight Zone then this might float your boat, but it may be all too real for some people to handle! It is one of the best mind opening show which hits in a very serious yet lesser known issue to humankind. Technology is a boon for us but it can be a bane it not kept in check.
A must watch!! First of all, if you browsing for a show to watch, look no more and go with Black Mirror ( im surprised that you havent allready). But i found it myself by accident, looking for a good show to chill. And man, was i hooked from the 1st 5 mins.
Its really good show, each episode will surprise with the meh moment again and again. Every time i found myself wondering about the episode i watched, days after. My favorite SciFi shows are the original Twilight Zone, X-Files, Twin Peaks, Stranger Things, Maniac, Manifest, and Fringe. What a great show this is. It's stunning! The writing puts most other shows to shame. I don't care if it's cliché, but San Junipero was my favorite episode. This one stood out to me the most. Some of the other episodes were more heart pumping and filled with action, but I really enjoyed the story on this one. Acting is also stellar across all episodes. Short review, but if you like the other shows I've listed, you'll really enjoy this one. Brilliant insights of where technology can take us. Throws out the deep agony human instinct and technology coupled take us. For sure not the average series you see. Overall an entertaing show. A few episodes I had to skip out of boredom.. any episode over an hour was too long. I found the darker episodes better and the majority of the UK episodes over the US ones..<br/><br/>Sure there's something here for everyone..<br/><br/>The show is a bit overrated if you ask me..<br/><br/>For great US sci-fi check out Electric Dreams on Stan here in Australia.. much more superior than the US episodes here.. The 1st ep put me off watching the rest of the show but ended up finishing season 1. In some episodes it is pretty disturbing. TBH I didn't like it Favourite episodes - the one where you get a popularity rating & the one with the robot dogs, the one with the bees, the one with the horror game. Least favourite - the one with the annoying, offensive animated politician, the one with the robot boyfriend, the one where you can play back your memories. Some of them are really insightful and warnings of where we are headed. Others feature too much sexism, objectification and just plain wrong to be warnings or insightful, some are just not realistic. Some have little messages within the episodes that just completely undermine the idea of the episode e.g. in the boyfriend robot episode there is a scene where she is really enjoying having sex with him and she surprisedly asks where did he learn to do that. He says he uploaded porn films, I thought to myself if he/it had learned to have sex from porn he'd be hitting her, spitting on her and calling her names while not being at all concerned with her sexual pleasure so technically he'd be crap at sex. All episodes are depressing & scary. Some of Us, as Futurists, Scientists, Philosophers, Ethicians "Computer Enthusiasts" did think about the implications of Technology, as Sociology, Philosophy's Norms, Morals, Ethics, Mores.<br/><br/>Scientist's is this possible of Theoretical Science becoming Applied Science and Applied Physics.<br/><br/>Regretfully, the Masses of Humanity refused to listen, we watched Technology get perverted from Original Intent to make money, not to make Humanities Quality of Life any better. Everything was all about how much money could be made as profits.<br/><br/>This TV Series does show the Black Mirror, the Evil Reflection of the Perverted Use of Technology, that has been readily accepted as "Normal" by most Millennials (ages up to 39), most have been conditioned to only write a 140 character Tweet, as British Term "Twits", and worst yet those are considered the smart ones, that don't even know how to Capitalize because the technology did not auto capitalize the words for them so they mistakenly think they are right.<br/><br/>We see now a days a 100% lack of privacy, as just about everything is videoed, recorded.<br/><br/>I have seen personally what happens to a "Modern" City when everything electrical has been permanently destroyed by Electro Magnetic Pulses and Electro Magnetic Radiation and took years to rebuild replace. First was the Denial, then Rage and Riots, Extreme Violence, Despair, and finally Acceptance, people actually interacted more with each other, held face to face intellectual conversations, their birth rates sky rocketed.<br/><br/>We see now a days on the Internet Vidoes that were posted only for one purpose destroy somebody's life. - Black Mirror National Anthem or topple a Government.<br/><br/>Today We have video recorders everywhere and Go Pro cameras, drones that can be bought and used to record things not previously recordable, next step implants - Black Mirror The Entire History of You.<br/><br/>Many of Us thought about How to "Eternal Life". Cloning, Consciousness Transfers, Genetic Engineering, Social Engineering, and many others "That Would Change the World". We carefully thought of the consequences. i have read the reviews on this show and for that reason i feel that i must write a brief one myself. I admit that i have only watched the first episode (that most people seem to think was the best) but i have to say that i will not be watching any more.<br/><br/>A few people here have commented about the acting being very good, which it is, some have commented on the 'unusual plot'... and it is unusual. One of the more negative reviews commented on the fact that some of the details of the show are lacking/missing and i agree with this.<br/><br/>What i find difficult to believe is that no one has picked up on the fact that this show (the first one anyway) was absolutely disgusting/disturbing!! The fact that i felt disturbed after watching it is the only positive thing i can say about it... if you don't feel disturbed after watching this show then there is something seriously wrong with you! Do yourself a favour, stay well away! The first two seasons were good. The third started great. Then, they went with that ubiquitous leftist propaganda about a number of themes (gender, euthanasia, supposed racial discrimination). I can't understand this urge for politics. The series is now trash. Season 5 best to worst goes: Bandersnatch, 1, 2, 3. I only wish Miley Cyrus was a choose your own adventure episode too, so I didn't have to watch as much Miley Cyrus. Season 1-2
Smartly written and well cast, the individual episodes keep circling back to such apprehensions, with darkly satiric overtones that distinguish it from most of what's currently on U.S. TV.
Season 3
Black Mirror continues to be as bracingly original and thought-provoking as ever before, a Twilight Zone-influenced gem for the technology age that Brooker only seems to get more creative at fleshing out.
Season 4
The "grandson" of Twilight Zone is loaded of surprises in the 4th season. The episodes that deserves all attention the ones that tributes Star Trek and Alfred Hitchcock presents. The final episode is an hyperbole.<br/><br/>Stephen King described Black Mirror as "terrifying, funny, intelligent. It's like the 'Twilight Zone,' only rated R." That's actually giving it short shrift. ... What makes the series special is how there is always one more twist that you didn't expect in the same way there is always some implication--usually for ill--in a new invention that we didn't think of. This new season will only add to the acclaim This show is completely awesome! I love how its not beginning, plot, end for the entire show. I love how every episode has its own individual story of some type of chaos or disturbing piece. Something I love about this show is how there is always a different character every episode and surprisingly enough all the actors are really good actors. It was very cool to see this contemporary phenomena! I loved watching the episode based on the woman that fell in love with the duplicate of her dead ex boyfriend, but quickly got tired of him because he did not display human emotions. Bringing back the classing Twilight Zone commentary under the guise of fiction, Black Mirror feels only SLIGHTLY exaggerated from where we're heading in the future. <br/><br/>It's a horror classic with our reality laced in science fiction, with superb acting and writing that doesn't seem to quit even in their lesser-liked episodes. <br/><br/>It's a win across the board. I recommend it to all of my friends and so should you! I must say from the start to the end amazing!! I love how each episode is different and takes you into a new light. Very interesting movie with on point acting. Brilliant scripts and screenplays. It packs all the jitters of a thriller and gloom of the dark side of technology. All following episodes have been awesome. It's like a twisted combination of twilight zone and the Canterbury Tales by Chaucer on steroids. The show shines a light on our dependence on technology, our twisted social paradigms, and our hurtle toward a disturbing dystopian very-near future. Every story is a cautionary tale. My advice is to skip the first episode, I wish I had never seen it. This is a show like none other i have ever seen in my life. The descriptions says its Sci-fi show, but the story line makes the technology part take a back seat and show cases how humans can be cruel and petrifying in a way never imagined before. This show is not for the faint-hearted though, it gets really dark and horrifying. Though not supernatural some episodes like "Be Right Back" and "White bear" will petrify even the strongest of nerves. Black Mirror is not what I expected. I had never seen it nor heard of it until April of 2017. Based on the reviews I downloaded the series. Maybe it was all the hype, but I am less than impressed with it. I gave it a chance and watched everything to date and have concluded - someone fell asleep in the middle of a Twilight Zone Marathon while reading William Gibson's Neuromancer and decided to develop a TV series upon awakening. Unfortunately, the person that develops it came away with little more than a "B-grade Fan Film" of the bastardized offspring of those two classics. It will appeal to tween/teen demographics for its willingness to center around technology. Unfortunately, it is nothing but another low production value piece English tripe. Black Mirror is one of those programmes that never, no matter what, disappoints. After emotionally tearing you apart, psychologically intoxicating you, and even after intellectually stimulating to the point of lunacy, you will still be looking forward to watch an other episode. <br/><br/>However, you will only be marvelled that each episode contains different characters, setting and plot. This certainly happened to me and I couldn't stop thinking about how a future that seems so distant in the episodes, could actually be the state of humanity in 10 minutes. <br/><br/>Maybe this is the reason why Black Mirror is so good. It leaves you to think what happens after the episode has finished and your screen has turned black. Turned into a black mirror itself. Wow i was so amazed to be referred to this series.It had been long anything could catch my attention.I was kind off bored of routine content in many other series.Black mirror is just more than awesome.<br/><br/>The mind behind this has to be appreciated.It not just entertainment but a food for thought kind off series.<br/><br/>What creativity,what enactment superb drama !! I am actually short of words due to the uniqueness of this work. A view may be dystopian one at times but is really mind boggling.<br/><br/>Tons pf appreciation and hatsoff to the creativity. The first one I watched had to do with an iPhone type phone rating folks. Funny.<br/><br/>I watched two horrific ones I can never get over. (Will explain more if anyone cares.)<br/><br/>Watched at least one great one. Two lovers spend eternity together using a server farm. They are LGBT but it doesn't matter, could have been any gender, any choice, was only related to love and decisions and eternity. So, this popped up on my recommended viewing list on Netflix... didn't know what I was in for, just bored and needed something to binge on.<br/><br/>What a surprise! I just finished the third episode and am going to move on to more... really looking forward to seeing more! They are all separate stories with a common theme (so far): Technology and humanity.<br/><br/>From the title, I guessed it would be dark. But this really delves into what is so F'd up with society and just what technology is doing to us; a little scary and quite enlightening.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend it for a first date night, but if you want to watch something to just reflect on while enjoying some fantastic acting, brilliant writing, or just to binge a little... or a lot, you're gonna be blown away. I'm sitting here writing this, still just a little disturbed at what I have watched. This is really one of those series that you just watch by yourself, with no distractions. On the wall. What the best TV series of them all?<br/><br/>Well, this is certainly one of them. Black Mirror trapped me, looking into it's gaze and I loved what I saw staring back at me. <br/><br/>Each story is different, but all episodes have an undercurrent of technological variations. It highlights what society will become (and in some cases already is), from being completely obsessed with our phones and social media (society is well past this point), to the afterlife and how we might best use technology for the power of good...and love. <br/><br/>There were perhaps 2 weak episodes for me personally, one being 'Men Against Fire' (yawn) and the second being 'White Bear'. They for me were just a bit boring and done to death. All the other episodes border from sublime - to breathtakingly beautiful. All of the episodes are wonderfully acted though. <br/><br/>Do not miss out on this. Disturbing yes- but it reflects a world we actually inhabit now - damned until the end of this civilisation, shackled to our phones and selfies. Some may look at themselves differently after this- I certainly did. <br/><br/>Judging by this body of work, the writer Charlie Brooker is, quite frankly a Genius. In the last couple of days, everybody around me were talking about this series thus I decided to start watching it. When I watched the first episode, I was impressed enough. First of all the way they summarize the topic is unique unprecedentedly. <br/><br/>In each episodes, it has a different team different actors and actresses also different stories but all episodes has a common point which is criticisms of modern society and its challenges. We all can see modern technology became our new friend that is ruining our life in every second of every day.<br/><br/>This is more than a TV series, this is giving us a way to think with a critical approach. Thanks for giving me a different point of view. This is one of the most amazing series I seen recently.It clearly shows the dark side of the technology - sometimes it looks similar to 1984 and The Brave New World. it has a dark (noire) style and it is not an optimistic view of our near future, but it really catch the moment. This is not a story what you can watch easily, you need to prepare your mind to be opened to the future technologies and the dark side of the humanity. You experience and learn how man can give u sovereignty and independence. It is a vision of total control and mass surveillance never seen before. There is an episode for a kind of digitized heaven and eternal life, but the story about humans , their minds and how they can deal the options they have. So fasten your seat belt and start your journey... Black Mirror it's an English series absolutely actual, it's mostly a drama/sci-fi series and it's centered on the current or future problems of the western society. It's already on the third season but you have to consider that every episode it's a movie completely different between each other and without a common script. But every single episode it's able to bring you in that word and environment, every single episode is well written and well directed and the cast works great. It's one of the best series of the last years due this uniqueness. Since is treating and telling story and problems about the actual or near future society and the dark side of technology you have to consider that every single episode is a reflection and meditation starting point that most of the time can let the viewer with a sad sensation or let with a bitter taste. Absolutely a must to watch Although this show can definitely be corny/edgy, I think every episode of this show (minus the bear episode) catches my attention and makes me want to keep watching! I think they are enjoyable to watch and they have very nice cinematography as well as well performing actors. With the exception of (the masterpiece that is) San Junipero, they are all genuinely creepy to some degree too. My favorite episodes would be Fifteen Million Merits, White Bear, San Junipero and Playtest. The Banksy-esque technology themes can seem a little tiresome but not enough so that it affects my interest in the show! I'll Keep watching until they stop making them. Fantastic. Thought provoking. Seed Planting. Concept exploring and not trying to answer questions though questions are placed well enough that you can decide for yourself.<br/><br/>Each episode is a different "world" or set of characters. Mostly set in a world very much like ours now. Entertaining in a way, but better than that. Stimulating. You can try to guess where the stories going and all that but you're just missing the point and perhaps denying, that this is a mirror, showing back at us what we know is moments away if not here now.<br/><br/>I have long felt that we often attack new technologies, phones, internet realms etc, pointing out the undesirable behaviours surrounding them, but really the only problem there is that we aren't equipped to handle these immense powers/tools. Physical/mental evolution has been shocked by the unimaginable parabola of technological power we all have, even the poor, and the speed and leaps of imagination are only going to get crazier. Soon, we could create new nations/planets with each generation. Not that we should. So far, we're already confronted with these challenges and our society as a planet is paying for the incongruity of what is possible and our old structure, the one we know. Understandable.<br/><br/>So, Black Mirror, highlights the weakness we deal with when confronted with our great power. The addictive and often extremely disheartening behaviours and inhumane reactions we have to this new world.<br/><br/>Most episodes could have been made into movies. Not that they should have but could have which shows value. These 45 minute tales are tidy and well developed. If you like one you're likely to like them all just not all the same way. Some the episodes are actually worth returning to as soon as your done. I won't say which. A number of episodes, I watched online, I immediately returned to a few key moments in the story after seeing the end of the episode. One of them I just went straight back to the beginning. Good stuff. The USA needs more stuff willing to go there but we're so sensitive, fearful of saying the wrong thing, judgemental and crippled by originally well intentioned etiquette (or P.C. culture or whatever). I suppose we're not the only ones cause those very things are covered a bit in Black Mirror as well. Inspiration 0 for this series. Season 1 just have mediocre things nothing to make this show intersting. I was very exciting about this show, but after the last episode I become disappointed. Don't get me wrong. The first episode of Black Mirror was a pleasure, while the second was absolute disappointment.<br/><br/>The pilot hooked me so strong that I recorded it, while the second episode throw me away after 20 minutes of watching. I hoped that it will continue that excitement and great story from pilot, but it failed.<br/><br/>I will not spoil here about the plot, but the first episode is all that is worth to see Black Mirror. I just hope that the third episode will bring back that good feeling as it was at the start.<br/><br/>I could not find much of information about the show, nor there are many of reviews there, nor ratings here on IMDb, but if I could conclude something about this series from first episode, it is the great critique on today's society, especially to the Government apparatus. I like the idea how they represent protest to the leading structure. There's keys to good storytelling. One of them is suspension of disbelief. Nowhere in this episode was my utter disbelief remotely suspended, from the inherent issues that spew from the futuristic technology to the characters actions/reactions. The whole thing was a farce, wearing a current topical issue on its sleeve in an attempt to be thought provoking. Terrible. The only extra star I gave it was for the actors attempt to save a criminally bad script. This series is a pure gold. It is so fascinating and very well made, that i admire those who write the stories. Such a creative team! Not all the episodes are perfect, (while, most of them are..) but this concept is a perfection. Sci-Fi series that is not about promoting Sci-Fi, but how we humans could get affected by new technologies. It makes you think, and it makes you think deep. Some of the episodes are truly breathtaking!
It dives into questions we've been all asking ourselves at one point or another, there in the back of our mind - even if we haven't told anybody about these thoughts.
Things like going to the doctor, where he would immediately know what kind of pain you are experiencing and what might be the culprit, robots taking over the world, implants and the direction towards us becoming more intermingled with computers through the means of implants, VR etc. are just fantastic topics that this series explores. The series centers around it's title with both it's meanings. Black Mirror is another way of saying screen, TV screen, iPad, iPhone...etc. There is also the literal meaning, a mirror that reflects the darkness in our nature. In each episode the black screen is used as a way to reflect the worst humanity back at itself. <br/><br/>Black mirror changes the story, setting and actors with every episode. Each is a self contained plot though it seems to happen within the same universe. This keeps things interesting and fresh with the motto show, show, show. <br/><br/>I found the first episode to be re-pungent, Since this was the one used in the trailer before the show aired I had avoided this series for years. <br/><br/>Fortunately the first two episodes were the most... I'm going to use the word controversial here since the one that comes to mind would be censored. After that the show finds it's moral footing. <br/><br/>Because of this I don't think it's for everyone however the ideas and scenarios in the show are not too far fetched as regardless of the plot of the episode there is always the a central theme of focusing on the spectacle, of how things will be perceive. Rather than the person or their actions. <br/><br/>In a world governed by Likes and star ratings, this makes sense and I would recommend it. Just maybe skip the very first episode if you didn't find the trailer appealing. "Black Mirror" - what an interesting name.
 I didn't expect much when friend suggested me to watch it, but with every episode i wanted more... i was intrigued, thrilled, sometimes terrified and breathless after watching. 
 So i watched all 3 seasones at the time and couldn't wait for next, then forgot about it until ... until season 4 came out ... at first all seems so familiar (atmosphere, dark/light scenes contrast, etc), but (no, BUT!) story didnt develope through the episode (watched 2 episodes so far), it was monotone with no chill going through my spine, no explicite scenes and it doesn't make you think (you just don't give a damn about episode, about ending, about subject in it) ... such disappointment
p.s.: 10 stars for first 3 seasons, and maybe ~5 stars for season 4. OK, I'm watching this series up to season 3 so far and I gotta say, why is there so much hate? I read so many hate comments saying how it tries to emulate Twilight Zone and it's not even as good as the reboot from 2002 So what if it's not as good as Twilight zone? It is still a good series, with episodes that are like mini movies with a good plot or a twist that makes them so enjoyable. Sure the first episode was a complete mess, but the rest of the episodes actually are entertaining to watch, with stories you can actually get a message from It's not the best series out there, but it's certainly far from being the worst just because "it's not like Twilight Zone" (which hardcore fans don't even liked the reboot) My advice, watch the series if you like thrillers or sci-fi movies, only that these last an hour or less Imagine a world where every single person you meet on a day to day basis uses their phone to "rate" you, and you use your phone to "rate" them, as you walk past them in the street, as you buy your morning coffee from them, or as you get your morning newspaper from them. This is the odd, but all-too-foreseeable kind of society Black Mirror – Episode 1 – "Nosedive", focuses on, forcing viewers to contemplate a life like this, a life where even the coffee boy at work, rates you, and you him.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard plays the main character Lacie; a cutish, bouncy, overly-fake woman, who scrapes her social rating up from a 4.2 to a 4.5 by being overly nice and overly helpful to everyone she meets. 4.8 is pretty high, and belonging to the elite of the elite, is pretty unattainable for Lacie.<br/><br/>Like Facebook, people have their own online accounts where whole lives are broadcast for all to see with the use of captions, slogans, and photos. And accompanying these pages is a massive rating in the top right-hand corner, that is forever updating itself to reflect your social success or your social awkwardness – how people have rated you, using a five star system.<br/><br/>Alice Eve plays Naomi; a very successful blonde socialite who has a rating of 4.8 – and hers is a rating that never drops below that. Her online presence makes it seem that she lives a perfect life, and as she is about to marry the perfect man, she will also have the most perfect of futures as well. She and her fiancé do not have any friends with a rating below 4.2 – that would be an absolute social faux pas in her opinion and in the eyes of many others.<br/><br/>As it goes – high-raters stick with high-raters, and low-raters have no choice but to socialise with fellow low-raters, for high-raters will not accept them in their social circles. It is a very abstract, but kind of realistic analogy for society's current climate – people socialising with people with the same kind of social status, and excluding anyone who doesn't fit their mould, per se. However in 2017 rating people using our phones isn't something that has started trending as of yet, so let's just hope that this concept doesn't filter into real life any time soon.<br/><br/>As a lover of concept shows I would give this episode a rating of 4.8, meaning that it was pretty damn good. I don't understand the acclaim for "San Junipero", I felt it wasn't a standout episode and the weakest story of Season Three. For me "Shut Up and Dance" (I concluded all the characters were guilty of the same despicable crime- despite Hector's story) and "Hated in the Nation" were the standouts of Season Three.To me, "Nose Dive", "Playtest", "Men Against Fire" would have been more captivating at 30 minutes. Sometimes I felt impatient with those three episodes - story lines are needlessly reiterated and plot development was at a standstill for too long. All that said, "Black Mirror" is some of the best sci-fi I've seen in recent years. I am impressed by this excellent series. Each and every episode is like a stand alone movie - except that it has a by far over average strong and deep story and plot. The production is excellent as well. I have seen all 3 seasons and there are no weak episodes. The Quality is very high. It's probably the best series/movie(s) I have seen for many years - or ever. <br/><br/>I am grateful for artists and producers that create material of such quality. It awakens my own creativity as well.<br/><br/>However, I would like to add a warning label: The stories are, to say the least, not inspirational uplifting - reminding you the title "black mirrors". This is not the best pick on bad and depressing days, or just before you go to bed. Horror movies like Blair Witch is a good-night story by comparison. Black mirrors challenges our deepest existential fears and unachievable desires in life. This is written by Charlie Brooker (and others) and is quite worrying. Some of it already seems very realistic and a bit scary. The dependence on smartphones is turning people into lazy ignorant morons. WeChat in China is a good example. Nobody talks to each other, even couples in restaurants. If you haven't seen it in Episode 1 the British Prime Minister "has relations" with a pig. That would never happen would it? The acting, directing and use of locations is superb. Every episode is different but seems to have a message about our increasing dependence on modern technology and "social networking". But at the cost of our increased feeling of isolation. I think. I haven't seen them all yet. Black Mirror is a British TV show that shows the darkest aspects of life and technology. Each episode is a different story, but they all have one thing in common: make you think about how technology/life/human beings can be terrifying. It's kind off a sci- fi/drama/thriller show that really messes with you and I believe it changes you. You'll not forget it soon.<br/><br/>The first episode was so disturbing, I can't even describe how shocked I was during the whole thing. The rest are also disturbing but not as much as the first one. I think it was a statement: "this is not going to be a easy TV show to watch but we show the truth about cruelty, about how technology can impact our lives and about us, human beings". I watched all the episodes and I can say they are disturbing (in different levels) but they're all very impressive, well executed and we can see how much effort and thought all the directors/writers/actors put in each episode.<br/><br/>If you watch the first one and just want to quit, give it another chance and watch the third (which I think is one of the best episodes of a TV show I have ever watched). Give it a chance and watch the first season, it's only three episodes and, believe me, it's worth it. As every good show, almost nothing will attract you to watch a lengthy episode which takes time to engage to its audience other than a friend explicitly telling this is a "must watch".<br/><br/>Don't take me wrong when I say almost everything in the show excels expectation but not quite gets there: direction is good, but not consistent. Screenplay is diverse, so every episode has its own rhythm, but packing them together feels unnecessary. There is no bad acting but all characters lack to linger on to the public, you won't cheer or despise one: you don't even need to know their names. If you keep judging each aspect of the series separately you will end up finding flaws adding up to a point you will ask yourself why did you ever watched this, but join all this and it works. Beautifully. <br/><br/>Fiction is used the way it should, helping to prove a point rather than being a gimmick, much like Star Trek did. The critique is always direct and consistent being not about a fictional character or universe but our own, meaning you will care for this series as much as you do for our world. If you do care, make yourself a favor: gather an interesting group of friends, have some popcorn, watch an episode and have a good talk.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping this series from a 10 is its replay value, you won't find much more after your first watch. This is one of those shows that from the description you just aren't sure if it will be for you. It's worth it. This show creates different levels of attachments to the characters in the short period of time you have with them. Production value means nothing if the story doesn't grab you and pull you in, but do not underestimate the power of having these two elements in an excellent mini-series. The creativity that went into each unique story is enthralling! It's absolutely worth taking the journey that is "Black Mirror".<br/><br/>Characters - 9/10 Creativity - 10/10 Cinematography - 8/10 Editing - 8/10 I've not yet watched all available episodes of Black Mirror, but my impression so far is that this is completely unlike any other series (anthology or otherwise) I've seen. The stories are diverse and seem to come out of left field, which is brilliant in its own right. They do share a common theme, however - examining the darker side of technology and how it's come to dominate our lives for better or worse.<br/><br/>Can't really say much more without spoiling it but one doesn't need to be a science fiction/fantasy fan to truly appreciate this show. It's got a powerful message and will, in my opinion, inspire viewers to contemplate some of the larger questions facing the human race. The drama and acting are uncommonly good to excellent; the pacing taut and intense. It's an enjoyable experience as much as it can be an uncomfortable one, but the discomfort is a good thing; after all, how many t.v. shows truly make us use our brains these days? Best mini-series i've ever seen. Need to regenerate and hug someone after every episode to start a new one. <br/><br/>The best part is that you don't have to watch it in order. You can disturb your brain with it random order. The worst part is that this episodes can happen in the near future us. Chipsets, Big Brother, mobile phone addiction (its here), people without connection to each other, people who can't imagine life without TV. Orwell will win this game soon.<br/><br/>In order of stars earned:<br/><br/>The Entire History of You 10/10<br/><br/>Be Right Back 10/9<br/><br/>Fifteen Million Merits 10/9<br/><br/>The National Anthem 10/8<br/><br/>White Bear 10/8<br/><br/>The Waldo Moment 10/6 I watch the first episode and immediately turned it off and deleted my Netflix account. No way they're getting my money if they put it towards creating shows like this. And I hear they have new episodes coming out all the time? What has become of this world we live in? Utter garbage. This is the most brilliant TV Show (Drama) ever! I want more and more and more episodes, please. I'm done watching all 19 episodes and I must say it was amazingly done in all aspects of the film. The 19 episodes were all great. The actors, the director, the writer, the setting, the involvement of technology & innovation, and the moral lessons we learned. I think if you're a person who is into technology and appreciates how it works, you will surely relate to each episode. The common ground is the technology and innovation. How it could affect our living today and in the future. All stories have a basis or common logic and who knows it could really happen to you in the future. You have to be open-minded and understand the logic of technology in order to understand and relate yourself to each story. I think ALL 19 episodes were my favorite ones. By the way, I work as a freelance web developer and really into online games and technology and latest innovation, so I really like and appreciate this kind of show. Very refreshing and new. Also, the casts were great. I like the idea of mixing famous actors and newbies. It's always nice to see new faces on the screen. Kudos Black Mirror! I want more episodes for the next season please! :) The people who wrote this must have taken a trip to the future.To me this don't just seem likely to happen, it looks destined to. It's so authentic compared to what might happen in the future that it's scary. I can't seem to go on with my life without seeing parts of this movie everywhere. Unfortunately this movie don't have a bright outlook on the future. But I guess that's the point. Not to show a worst case scenario, but what we bit by bit might become if we stay on the same path. It's really fascinating how they describe everybody's desire to fame and power. If you are going to watch this, be prepared to might have a gloomy outlook on the future. I don't easily give 10's, but a 9 just didn't feel right for this show. This is VERY well written (acted, produced, directed) and a breath of fresh air between the many American series. Don't get me wrong, things like Breaking Bad are great, but very different. Where every once in a while a BB-episode will end with a truly shocking event, every single one of these Black Mirror-episodes feels like one big shock. (Then again, they only make 3 episodes per season!) The material is such an accurate reflection of the time we live in and is so condensed that the stories are hard to shake off for quite some days after viewing. Again, very well written. Notice, for instance, how amazingly natural the dramatic principle of foreshadowing is applied. This satirical show that shows how society has been taken over by electronic technology starts off with quite a statement. Whilst the first episode is quite in your face, the following do taper off into more normal stories without the controversial impact. But nonetheless, Black Mirror takes the view of technology to a whole new level, showing how it dictates life and the possibilities of it overrunning society completely. <br/><br/>Whilst this black comedy of humans dependence on technology may work well from the get go, the other episodes do tend to blend together a little too much, showing little individuality between episodes. However, that is not necessarily a bad thing, as each episode still is a riveting as the last. Quite a confronting, great TV show that will do anything to get your attention. Just started watching this in 2015 and i'm completely blown away, every single episode manages to really disturb me and touch me on an emotional level. <br/><br/>The series, in which we follow a new set of characters in a new story each episode we see the flaws of our society, how technology, art, politics and so on can utterly obliterate our sense of reality. The different themes of each episode is very welcoming and the stories fit perfectly in the 40min time frame. I can without doubt say that this is the most heartfelt and sad series i have ever watched and after days i'm still thinking about each and every episode!<br/><br/>Must see 10/10 Whilst most of the episodes that have aired have interesting concepts, most are far from developed to their potential.<br/><br/>The first episode from the first season is Jaw dropping and revolting as you are unaware of what to expect. The first episode turns from what appears to be a lighthearted comedy to a explicit horror short in the span of 40 minutes (If I can remember correctly).<br/><br/>This formula however is often played throughout the rest of the series and there is lack of surprises from then on. The viewer can imminently tell from watching one episode of Black Mirror that the next will structure in the same format, the same message and nothing else new added.<br/><br/>San Junipero is by far my favourite episode out of the entire series, as it shifts the current themes played throughout the episodes of possible dystopians and anxieties we have towards future technology into something more positive. It allows to viewers to be aware that whilst the idea of communication online
and the lack of human interaction face to face is a frightening thought, it elaborates on the better outcomes and persuades a message that sometimes you meet the unlikely friendships and relationships that would most likely to have never happened without the help of technology. Brilliant Series. Explores so many concepts, love how every episode has its own moral or lesson. And there are so many brilliant actors. Best UK show in years :) I have watched the whole series and it was something which i never seen, even i did not have any thoughts of them. The whole series is based on a human society where science is very much advanced. The government said that it was all for human well fair. Governments always manipulated normal civilian thoughts in case if they become rebels and will be treats for them. In our sleeping cells we disabled our thinking that scientific advancements also have their drawbacks. Team black mirror conveyed this message to all it's viewers that nobody should manipulate or bend the laws of nature. Because if this law is tampered by science, then the whole humanity must be prepared for it's fatal consequences. A brilliant 'what if' tv show that holds, no pun intended, a black mirror to society. After a long time I am writing a review for a web series. It's very unique script is quite refreshing.it tells the effect that technology might have on our day to day life and relationships.the dialogue writing is also quite good and the cast chosen is very capable.although i couldn't help bit notice that there are too many episodes showing how the "love" between two individuals is affected by technology.I would have liked if it showed other aspects of day to day life in correspondence with political life.
But overall its worth watching and definately one of the best ones yet.. But some of them are boring
There some weird episodes
The one with the VR fighting game was good
The last one with miley cyrus was just ok
Nosedive was one ofthese episodes i enjoyed and i knew how the mother feels if it would happen to my daughter if i had one This is my first review ever.. and I want to try to describe this..but and from every angle I look and i always come up with one word ..."madness" tish is a new kinda realistic crazy.. everyone gotta watch this and throw the TV in tha garbage immediately.. people gotta keep in control... and we are the people Until season 4 everything is GREAT... you must see it...but first 3 episodes on season 5 are big fail....very very bad... I used to love this show, every episode made me feel uncomfortable, anxious and gave me a lot to think. Season 4 had some good episodes but others let me down and season 5 it's not black mirror anymore, i finished watching the 3 episodes and I was left with not even one of the feelings I used to have after watching the past seasons. The sci fi aspect became very limited, the stories quite boring and if those episodes were from another TV show, I wouldn't even continued after the first one. I don't need to see new episodes every year if this is the result, I'd prefer waiting few years if that would give me the good old depressive and filled with anxiety and hopelessness of the first seasons. It's rare that I write reviews or even change rating, but I do hope the next season will be better. Always if there is gonna be a new one. Black mirror will go down as one of my all time favourite shows. The story of each episode so twisted but yet believable is hard to describe untill your 30 mins into an episode and glued to the screen. The technology aspect is so clever and imaginative and has you hooked from the first second. ABSOULTY AVOID SEASON 5. (Would have been a 10 otherwise)This is my first ever review and I wrote it purely from my frustration of season 5. Another show destroyed from lazy writing and no character depth What so ever... Has to improve I absolutely can't wait for the next series of black mirror. I know it's only a few episodes but I absolutely loved all of the others. The written so well with such a believable cast of characters and completely possible storylines of the not too distant future. They are both a foretelling and a warning to us. Can't wait. Brooker is a god! Some of the best TV Ever in my eyes. Gripping and dark. I don't know what to say but this show is really fascinating. You could realize what will happen in the future is appears in black mirror show In this show each episode has different storylines but all of them come to say that people should have common awareness about technologies and understand the possible reasons beyond it. It also shows the darkest part of technologies which goes beyond human perception. We people have to adapt to latest technologies to make a survive in future. Anyone else thinks of "The Twillight Zone" tv show when watching "Black Mirror"? I think the show is awesome, I absolutely enjoy it and hope to see more episodes in the future :) This show is one hell of a ride. I definitely enjoyed some episodes more than others but I cannot say that I disliked any of them. All of them are unique and disturbing in their own way and I was glued to the screen throughout the entire series. Black Mirror is a series of episodes that are not related to one another except for the fact that each of them deals with some aspect of how technology is able to shape human life.<br/><br/>Reviewing this series would be like trying to review all nature programs. Some are about insects, others might be about outer space. The only common theme is the natural world.<br/><br/>Some of these episodes leave you full of hope for what will be possible in our lifetimes. Most of them leave you worried. Although I would say that overall they paint a bleak picture of what's coming, they would best be viewed as a reminder that we humans often fail to anticipate the ultimate consequence of our actions and discoveries. They show us that we can find ourselves in situations where we as a species walked inexorably into our own doom, unable to stop our march.<br/><br/>Such instances have already occurred in history, an example thereof would be the development of nuclear weapons. Although their existence is a threat to human life, it seems that for the time being we are unable to get rid of them. Think about it. They are not a virus, we have the capacity to destroy them, but our current political standpoint makes it hard for it to happen. Fussing with human genome has so far been avoided, but we have the technology and we only need one country to open this Pandora box. Same thing with AI. It seems that there is no way to stop the advances in AI, as it is advantageous for every country to invest in it, and countries that don't will be left behind. I don't think we have the capacity to even make a pause and think a bit, because there would certainly be someone else pursuing it, so we all walk inevitably to the further development of an evermore capable computer intelligence.<br/><br/>We live in a world where it is impossible for each of us to see the bigger picture as the specialization we are subjected too only allows us to be experts in a tiny area of knowledge, and this series alerts us to the possibility of unimaginable pain that we are going to be able to inflict on ourselves in a future that we will be able to see during our lifetimes. I just started this series I know I'm 8 years late, but tbh it is one of the best series I've ever watched so far! I don't think there is gonna be anything like this. The acting is so great, and what I like most is that you CAN'T guess the ending of an episode, they just surprise you,like the 2nd episode from season 3 "PLAYTEST". I'm already Googling if there is a 5th season and I'm still on the 3rd one LOL This show..THIS SHOW, what kept me away for so long from watching this show. Thank you Charlie Brooker for the best show of all time.<br/><br/>Black Mirror is a television series that originally aired on E4 for it's first two series until it was bought by Netflix, and has received a much more bigger audience since its removal. If I had to say, I do believe the show was a tiny bit better then when it was on E4, but I mean a TINY bit better, I am not saying the show got worse, but you can tell it got way more involved with the US, but still kept to it's original British roots. The series takes place in either the same universe or 19 different universes, which would make more sense as the show is very hard to piece together as a related universe show, and follows different futures where technology slowly begins to outsmarts man, in good ways and bad ways (by good ways I mean San Junipero and that's it). I am literally in love with the show, as it practically shows us how one day, technology is gonna roar over humankind and probably destory us, if it's physically or mentally. Some of the stories have already frickin happened (Nosedive, Be Right Back, National Anthem). The show has no bad episodes, although some do feel very poorer to others, but still send powerful messages. If there was a episode to send a silly message, it would have had to been Metalhead (even though I still love the episode and remain in my top 10 favourites) or Playtest or Men Against Fire, which were my two least favorite episodes out of the entire show. My favourite episodes have to be Fifteen Million Merits, Nosedive and San Junipero, darkest episodes would have to be Shut Up And Dance, Crocodile and White Bear, while least favourites would have to be Men Against Fire and Playtest.<br/><br/>Well, Black Mirror is officially my new favorite show now, sorry American Horror Story! Like a prophecy, lots of analogy and twisted issues, but probably best TV show ever made. In this moment (2018. year) seems to provide all answers about issues and dilemmas that you have about the world! I honestly did not expect any twists in any of these episodes, and the acting is quite superb. The creators of this show are geniuses.
The casting choices are also on point. Love all of the episodes! Out of the box amazing stories and concepts, open the mind to new dimensions Every Episode is different than the other but they all have the same realistic meaning in them. Amazing show.. Must See. Some episodes starts slowly and (sometimes) it doesn't seem worth watching. But wait until the end and you will be surprise how well each episode is. Also, don't hesitate to watch different episode at different times. I would recommend that you start if with season 3 and then watch the remaining seasons. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOITNED! Definitely that Black Mirror is a great Series, I simply advice all people to see this great show. In the beginning, the three first episode can be a little strangers and not so good like you are waiting for, but if you still seeing the rest of seasons, you will stay addicted that you wanna see more and more, because it's something really interesting. Just only more one thing, the most of episodes don't have nothing connected with previous episodes, but each of them are a great show that worth so much see. 10/10 The first two seasons of Black Mirror are probably my favorite content ever to be produced for TV. It's been fuel for a couple existential crisis's and it wears proudly it's heart on it's sleeve. No other TV show has put me in such a trance like state. Every single single scenario feels absolutely plausible, and when it doesn't, it's only because of this coating of sarcasm that makes itself obvious to the spectator. The casting is perfect.
What I love the most is the fact that every single episode becomes absolutely captivating after maybe 20 minutes, and never stops from there. I don't see this as a science fiction show. To me it feels like a social experiment, where they basically created a sandbox in order to play with the flaws of humans, showing that no matter how much technology evolves, we're still the same.<br/><br/>If only I could say that about the entire series.<br/><br/>After White Christmas, the stories lost their meaning. You can still enjoy the very forward thinking implementation of how humans would react to new tech, but it definitely feels more plastic. It's politics are mostly gone, and only present in very cliche narratives. This doesn't apply to everything though, Hang the DJ and San Junipero are both beautiful examples of how much they can play with your emotions in a productive way.<br/><br/>Give this show a try. Even if you disagree with it's premise, it's still nutrient-rich fruit for thought. I Actually Dont Watch Sci-Fi But Black Mirror Is Something Different. Unreal! A lot for think about after each episode.
Best series ever. It was alright I suppose and cheesy I love the cheesy ones makes them funny but I need a good movie/t.v. show to watch. Black Mirror is sci-fi high on shrooms: a very thought-provoking show, that will leave you with strong and very different thoughts and emotions after watching each episode. Some episodes will uplift you, some will depress you. I personally cannot binge watch Black Mirror because it is just so draining to watch. Each episode induces you to reflect on your humanity, your personal life, how you deal with society, how technology affects your connection to society, the future of technology, and many other things.<br/><br/>Each episode is a stand-alone episode (but is said to be occurring in one cinematic universe) so you can jump episodes and seasons (except for the last episode of season 4-- watch that last). Different episodes have different characters (and I think writer and creators).<br/><br/>Black Mirror is the modern version of the Twilight Zone. It combines various genres in a predominantly sci-fi theme, while providing a utopian or (mostly) dystopian satire of humanity's technology-dependent present and future.<br/><br/>I highly recommended that you watch this show, especially if you belong to the young generation (after the Millenials) who were born with all this "high technology" we now depend on. Just be patient with season 1 because that's a pilot season-- most pilot seasons usually are just building the series' steam. The 4th season might've not been so black mirror-ish, but it still shows the dark side of technology as intended. Though it may lean more towards style over substance in more than one case, Black Mirror still finds plenty of opportunities to perplex and depress This is an excellent series, each season is quite short, and each episode is an entirely separate story, with different cast and producers, so you can watch the episodes entirely on their own.<br/><br/>The red line connecting all episodes is how technological advances in a possibly quite near future might impact our lives. And here the focus is on possible side effects and misuses of the possibilities of new technology.<br/><br/>It is many times a journey into the darker sides of humanity in a dystopic future. But also how good intentions of new technology conflicts with our aspirations as good humans to have a loving and meaningful life. There is a wide spectrum of stories in this show, from very emotional love stories to dark sci-fi horror. So there is a very big variation in the episodes. and everyone start watching should find some real golden nuggets to like.<br/><br/>Stories are well thought out and seems quite realistic. No overplayed action or violence, you basically just know it is there to take the story forward which is good.<br/><br/>The show is really addicting to watch, you just want more of this mind expanding, thought provoking and sometimes frightening and disturbing stories about us as humans in a possible future. An amazing show, masterclass of stories and actors. I really look forward to season 5. What we have here is a show which is a disturbing commentary on the way that technology could lead society down a route that shapes our societies in a way that we never wanted it to. If you're new to the show, don't be put off by the first episode. First of all, it is probably the least Black Mirror like episode, but also consider that just because it is disturbing (as anyone in their right mind would say), it does say a lot about the people using that technology. Currently as of October 2018, there are 4 series out and series 1 and 2 are purely based in England and series 3 and 4 are mixed between England and the United States (although sometimes filmed elsewhere). The tone of the show definitely changes, but not necessarily in a bad way, however the American episodes seem to be somewhat glossier made though don't have quite the storyline that the English episodes have. For series 5, I'd like to see some more money spent on those episodes based in England. The episodes are consistently well thought out, though sometimes "a leap of faith" is required in the odd episode as the concepts don't fully add up if you scratch beneath the surface. It does however provide excellent drama. This is up there with 'Breaking Bad' for being a well written series with ideas that are there to challenge our ways. A lot of people give a lot of credit to Charlie Brooker, but I'd also like to add Annabelle Jones and other contributors. If you watch it and feel that you can't watch any more as it is too sick, give it a day or two and watch some more. These will really be, is truly an amazing show. That the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. Guys, I am not a regular watcher of this series. I have just watched may be a couple or more episodes and I am hooked.<br/><br/>Just watch the 6th episode of the third season and you will understand how deftly the makers handle the show. Simply mind blowing. Very tech savvy and and with brilliant narration, the series takes on very serious subjects. Ok, acting may be very mediocre by most of the artists, but you can't say the same thing about the making.<br/><br/>Must watch. The tv show is great and very well constructed. Cool plot and originality but...
for people with anxiety like me it's quite hard. it intensifies and triggers anxiety a lot and there should be a warning. All the episodes are well written and created... dark and twist, some times hardcore and really dark or extreme... but still you can believe that sometime in the future this can happen...<br/><br/>Amazing show, I cant wait for new episodes Created in 2011 by Charlie Brooker, it's a series who includes a different types like horror, sci-fi, thriller and drama.
It's an English series. This one talks about the impact of the new technology in our life.<br/><br/>Each episodes are independent. There is no order between them.
For example, the episode "nosedive" the most realistic in the series, show a fictive world where everybody gives a rating using their phones.
I like this episode because it seems crazy to live in this world, to depend of the rating for the work, activities, earn apartment ...
If you have a bad rating, you can't do this things.
Bryce Dallas Howard who's playing the main characters gives a fantastic performance.
Concerning the realization of this part, the director wants to show us a perfect world with a catchy music and pastels colors.<br/><br/>However, "Hang the DJ" is less interesting than the others, because it seems too long and too confuse. The plot talks about only a date between two persons.
The ending of this part doesn't come across convincing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really recommend this series because there is a twist on every episodes. That's what makes this series unique.
It will change the way you see the new technology.
It's a must on Netflix, don't miss it!!!! This show is absolutely brilliant. There are only a few episodes out of all the seasons that were a little odd but overall the show is amazing! Dark and mysterious every disposes leaves you wondering about those twists endings. Always and favorite and easy to rewatch And im even underestimating this AMAZING show on how the (very nea ) future will be.Very very upsetting but so intresting socially,makes your brain works thats always a plus for me!Apart from this brilliant acting directing music etc.Well done guys!Keep on rocking! TBH , My honest opinion is to stay away from this series as it will induce doubts and have questions on your very existence and life.. It did spark something inside me which i dont think will never ever leave. <br/><br/>Its not bad ... its so wonderful and thought provoking on life and many other dark stuffs of life, its best avoided... It is very funny what happens when some people see the worst side of life, the worst side/version of themselves in front of their eyes. Black Mirror is definately an heir to The Twilight Zone, The X-files, Outer Limits etc. <br/><br/>It is almost pure Sci-Fi but based on the truths of our world today. It is disturbing, it is frustrating, it is pesimistic (except one episode, find out which), it is a guide-suggestion, on what to avoid so as not to turn technology/science into a freaking waking nightmare. <br/><br/>I don't like doing this but in this case I think it is imperative: People, my fellow reviewers... each episode is a "stand alone"! Different stories every episode. There is no continuity from ep to ep! That is the show format. For crying out loud, please!<br/><br/>Black Mirror is Hu-Man in the Mirror. The Mirror is Science/technology. It is up to us to de-black it. Make that Change. (Spoilers) Black Mirror is an anthology epesonic TV series set in the near future. A future in which technology will determine your every decision. The true antagonist in this series is the technology itself. This near technological future has created a dystopian society. <br/><br/>The real spoiler part come to my favorite episodes. Every episode is a 10 out of 10 stars. With a gun to my head I would highly recommend watching the "white Christmas" or with John ham. TRUST ME ITS GREAT! <br/><br/>Jeeze I literally love every episode I can't decide. Every episode is a story within its seat that involves technology in some sort of way...unlike in all the shows and movies on tv where "the bad guy" always loses and the good guys live happilu ever after....well this show is NOT that. All but 1 maybe 2 of these great GREAT stories with superb acting do not end with a happy ending for our main character or protagonist and it usually ends on a very bad, sour, depressing and twistful for our main characters. My adore series caus it takes all ideas will happen in our near future and make it in Black Image Ever since the pilot of the series, I've been utterly hooked to this television concept. Every episode is indeed very dark and very alarming. But, I find myself on the edge of my seat throughout the series, grasping onto each episode's stretched depiction of current technology (horrors). This is a very unusual program, and the controversy is understandable. But, "Black Mirror" delivers a significant yet intriguing reality, and makes me rethink our age of technology through each and every episode. The mind-boggling British science fiction "The Black Mirror" haunts the use of modern day technology through sharp and suspenseful episodes that present possible societal consequences.
Each episode contains a whole new story line and cast as it showcases a main character being challenged by "new age" technology, essentially going through a psychological crisis. With the use of dark satire, this tv series surrounds the audience with the "Twilight Zone" sensation of a dark and twisted nature. Black Mirror aims to display how advancements in technology will interfere with human nature. Daunting and wicked music aids to transitioning from scene to scene, as the audiences' anticipation grows with each heart beat.
Charlie Brooker, the writer and creator of Black Mirror projects the future side-effects of the overuse of technology; under;lying the subject of digital technology and potential within human development. The content of the series covers internal struggles that incorporate a major conflict between humans and nature. As the characters take on pressuring decisions, the audience begins an ongoing or repeated theme of ethics: what is considered wrong, right or honest, for humans to do.
Black mirror is an untraditional take on the common debate between the advantages and disadvantages of technology in society. Each individual story within an episode will keep you hooked on a thrilling experience of suspense and emotional trauma. Paradoxes of digital age affect us daily, although we may not know it or don't want to admit it. The Black Mirror reflects these paradoxes and possible dangers in an understandable, moderate, appealing way, without unnecessary moralizing or going to extremes.<br/><br/>Ideas from each episode, which last "only" 40-60 minutes, always sticked with me for several days. Episodes which aired on Netflix are less edgy and more straight to the point than those broadcasted on UK television, but Black Mirror is definitely one of the best drama shows in past decade. The first two seasons are captivating and original, I couldn't look away. They were also British (which the show is meant to be). Then something in the third season shifted, the writing of the episodes changed. I found myself bored, and they were American actors in very American episodes. Guns and army personnel, had me distracted and disoriented, forgetting that I was still watching Black Mirror. I am yet to watch the fourth season, but I am hoping they go back to original ideas and mind the bending episodes, fans love so much. I've watched this episode and its shocking in its brilliance. I'm sure to have nightmares tonight. OMG I love thats its always something new in every episode. Makes me think about the future and the different paths that us as people and science can go which i love. And i hope to see more seasons to come!! 14 of the 19 episodes so far have been brilliant, in my opinion. It is a British high tech version of the Twilight Zone of the early 60's. I was recommended an episode by my 14 year old son and I am hooked. It reminded me of a twilight zone episode and now he's hooked. How have I scrolled past this the last 6-7 years??? (Twilight Zone music plays in the background) I thought about watching this series for some time and I'm so happy I finally did, because this is what an anthology series at it's best can be. Reminds me a lot of The Outer Limits, which was one of my favorites back in the 90's.
Black Mirror is a fascinating way of looking in to the future more or less tongue in cheek. The only reason I'm giving it 9 instead of 10 is that I wish there was more horror elements, but you do get your share of horrible imaginary though. Also the first season as a whole is boring compared to the rest of the seasons. (The Waldo-episode was a complete snoozefest.)
The acting is really good. I also love the fact that I get to see familiar actors and actresses like Bryce Dallas Howard or GoT's Jerome Flynn, which also do an amazing job. The special effects are seamless and I wish more series and movies had such a fantastic effects.
Many of the episodes come together from the simple idea that technology and social media are consuming us and our world at a fast pace and it's dooming us more or less. I am not myself a huge friend of social media or the latest gadgets so I agree 100%.
You should most definitely watch this series, it will make your day! So entertaining, touching and deep, helps ppl be wiser and hopefully, make better choices . The ideas in each episode are also genius, cinematography also is good. U should watch it Black Mirror is definitely a well thought out series of different movies in each episode, which is definitely thought provoking; although it can get quite dark.<br/><br/>Would love to see an episode, on World War 3, or what would happen if all the nuclear went off. Wow , just an amazing show , best show on Netflix , each episode is a journey and different story . 
What makes this show an exceptional is that it's not just the new future technologies but mainly on the human nature and their interaction with this technologies .
Black Mirror need more recognition in the Awards galas like The Emmy and The Golden Globe , Charlie Brooker is a genius producer and screenwriter . Only episode I couldn't bear was the first one with the pig. Other then that it's an amazing show with superb actors and the special effects are tremendous. I love the idea of a new story in every episode. With this show you always think you know what's going to happen but you really don't and it's amaxing. Viewers expecting a gleeful, feel-good television show will not find one in Charlie Brooker's "Black Mirror", a technology centric Netflix series drenched in disturbing realities, social commentary and possible near-future outcomes. It is also a brilliantly-written anthology that serves as a 21st century Twilight Zone of sorts. Each season builds around several aspects of modern tech and how we humans may abuse them and how that tech may haunt us come a few decades. Yes, there have been one or two letdowns over the show's four year run, but all of them address key issues regarding modern day life and societal flaws, always remaining relevant and connected in some way. It's intimate and mature portrayal of people's lives affected by rogue tech is often disturbing, but thought-provoking and logical nevertheless. Its a pessimistic, often times depressing viewing, but its so effectively brought to life and so authentic, that it makes you think... a lot. Every episode in this show is a stand-alone story, with different characters in different settings. 
They are all linked by one theme - technology and human nature gone wrong. Mostly they are futuristic, ranging from 'could happen this year' up to 'far future technological dystopia.' 
If you like happy endings, you won't like this show. I think there is one happy ending among all three seasons. <br/><br/>S1E1 - I suggest you skip this one. It was by far the worst in my opinion, the only one I really disliked. It was pointless and disgusting, blackmail via social media for no apparent reason. 
S1E2 - a future dystopia show about using media entertainment to escape a dull reality. I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>S1E3 - a future where everyone has an implant that records every moment of their life and can be played back on screen. It was pretty good. 
S2E1 - Can robots replace people? Good presentation of complexity of emotion and personality. 
S2E2 - it is strange, you don't know what's happening for a while, without giving too much away it's kind of a dark twist on justice. I liked it. 
S2E3 - could happen this year - a look at public opinion and the fakeness of politicians. Very good. 
S2E4 - it says it is 'three interconnected tales' but it is all one story, and comes together at the end. Another 'technology and justice' story. <br/><br/>S3E1 - social commentary on virtual 'popularity,' well done. 
S3E2 - technological horror story, somewhat predictable but fun. 
S3E3 - technology and blackmail, this one is how the concepts of S1E1 should have been done. I liked this one, even if the kid was stupid - he's a teenage boy, so his foolish emotional responses are believable. 
S3E4 - a virtual reality romance, not my thing personally but well done. 
S3E5 - a commentary on combat and dehumanization of the 'enemy.' Very well done. 
S3E6 - a combination of technological terrorism/horror with social commentary - the deaths are pretty disturbing especially if you have certain phobias, but I really liked the show. Each episode builds on a futuristic word where our technology has become highly integrated with our lives. So much so, that many aspects of live have become perverted by the technology. Many of the stories are disturbing from the aspect of human interaction and technological interactions. The graphics are great, the technological ideas are believable, and the acting is great. Show too bad,
After watching two to three episodes,i finally realized that i have wasted my time on it ####<br/><br/>Season 4 update (02/08/19). Season 5 came out last month and I'm still dawdling around S4, Ep5/6. This is the way I watch BM - by watching one episode very infrequently and taking some months to recover from the enormity of the (let's hope erroneous) prediction. Still no better SciFi in 2019 IMHO.<br/><br/>####<br/><br/>I generally supply good reviews, however, very few TV series, films will ever get a rating of 10/10 from me. Black Mirror is one of those TV series.<br/><br/>As a fan of Sci-Fi (i.e. Ray Bradbury, Phillip K. Dick two of my all time fave authors), the writing in Black Mirror (BM) is deserving of accolades accorded to the aforementioned greats. BM brings into sharp focus the trajectory humanity *could be* on (see Prof Stuart Kauffman's concept of the 'adjacent possible') and extrapolates beyond our current smartphone reality to an altogether (sometimes) grimmer collection of alternative higher-tech futures. BM is great Sci-Fi for this principal reason. The cinematography provides some stunning visuals (Ep 4 - San Junipero) and perfectly blends periods across the time hopping story lines of some episodes. If you haven't watched Season 3, do so, if you have, watch it again.<br/><br/>"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." George Santayana This compelling series make you think. It's definitely not one of those bubblegum flavored shows that one just spits out and forget about the next day. <br/><br/>Who would LOVE this:<br/><br/>People who like reading slightly macabre short story anthologies <br/><br/>People who like sci-fi <br/><br/>People who want to delve into the dark side/implications of technology <br/><br/>People who love watching episodes that stay with you long after you've watched them<br/><br/>What to LOVE:<br/><br/>Amazing premise for each episode (fresh, original, etc.) <br/><br/>Great acting<br/><br/>Gorgeous visuals <br/><br/>Brilliant direction<br/><br/>I highly recommend this! EVERY EPISODE: When the main character/s are female - things work out for them in the end. When the main character/s are male - their endings are always extremely negative. Like everything else Netflix - it's heavily biased towards killing men while at the same time giving happy endings to female viewers in impossible ways.<br/><br/>I don't care how much budget is spent on the special effects (which are bootleg Dreamworks in the 90's quality) - when every show Netflix produces is pushing the exact same agendas, you start feeling like you're paying to watch the same show over and over. Which is why I didn't renew my subscription and am waiting for the upcoming new streaming services to finally overpower this trash factory. Every episode ending was awful. Hate this show, won't watch it again ever! Season 5, the episodes here are beyond good, just amazing. The creativity here, it makes me scream. My respect to the people who made this all up, just incredible! You cannot watch these episodes without just being blown away by the plot twists!!! It is really really amazing!!!! Yup not a fan, really getting tired of all these crap shows I just started wactching and i have to say, the first episode, u just have to think that this is something South park would and then i just started dying in laughter. Just think south park the whole time and you will to. Lol To say season 5 was a little disappointing is an understatement for 2 reasons. Firstly there is only 3 episodes and second I don't know if it is just me but the episodes seem to be aimed at a younger audience, comparing to the last four seasons content I was expecting more. Season 5 is a 0, while Season 1-4 was a 10. Watched the first episode of Season 5 and was wondering if we were watching Nick Toon. The concept was silly and cliche, the acting on some was laughable, and the ending was a joke. Actually I take that back, I have enjoyed watching Nick Toon with my kids more. Then episode 2 was just OK, nothing amazing but after episode 1, it's an upgrade. After that didn't bother with the 3rd episode, just didn't inspire much motivation to keep going.<br/><br/>And for those saying the criticism for Season 5 is unjust because it wasn't we expected, please stop. This is the same crew saying that we hated on GOT because we didn't get the ending we wanted. It's called "independent thinking". If something is bad, you say it's bad. Not be brainwashed into thinking everything is good when it's clearly crap just because you were die hard fans from the start. If I hadn't watched the first 4 seasons of Black Mirror, I'd still think Season 5 is crap as a stand alone series. It's because of it being Black Mirror that I had wasted my time on Season 5. Lf you appreciated Chris ...dark as a nun's habit...Morris - C20th+ you'll simply adore this as there's a stenchette of his brain-pan about. If you're too young ....simply the only excuse - go to Wikipedia now!<br/><br/>Every one else who gives BM 8+ here is bango-on. Every episode is a masterpiece of fantasy. It's amazing how each episode can be a reflexion of a future reality How anyone could rate this lower then a 10 is beyond me. Amazing writing, actors, filming. It has it all. It will blow your mind and make you think about things you've probably never thought to think about. Absolutely amazing and impatiently waiting for the next season because I can never get enough! Set in a dystopian society, Black Mirror isn't a regular tv show with a basic plot. Each episode is different and complex with a plot that is not predictable from the start nor the end. Each episode of Black Mirror ends on a huge twist.<br/><br/>My all time favorite episode of Black Mirror is the Season 1 Episode titled Fifteen Million Merits. It separates humanity into three categories: the lower class, middle class and upper class. The lower class have limited rights and menial jobs, while the middle class are forced to ride a bike all day hoping to gain fifteen million Merits in order to win the hot shot ticket and participate in the contest led by the upper class.<br/><br/>Black Mirror is quite dark and let's you see life differently. There are one or two episodes that are quite lighthearted, for example; the season 4 episode titled Hang the DJ. This episode leans into a world where all relationships have an expiry date and the only way to escape is to find your soulmate. It is quite an interesting concept, but sometimes the dating program contradicts itself.<br/><br/>To conclude, Black Mirror shows us the dark side of modern technology and how twisted it truly is. Every episode makes you think about how the future will look or if it already looks like it. Black Mirror is definitely a show people should start watching. I have loved this show back since it started, i've seen every episode numerous times and watched Bandersnatch many times as well. But reading that Miley Cirus has signed into season 5 is so very DISAPPOINTING to me! I think most of the public agrees she is a trashy trainwreck and trust me I am a lifelong Nashvillian and that isn't the way we are. I pray they rethink that choice of a cast member I have watched all the episodes and I love most of them, there are some that dont really resonate with me. However, all the episodes stand alone and could honestly be reviewed separately. Dont judge this show based on the first episode. Series started off great. As episodes went on I liked it less and less. White Christmas was amazing. Start there. When you watch expecting a twist its hard to be surprised. Not something you can rewatch since the reveal is the best part. Have you ever played a videogame online where somebody starts insulting and commanding his teammates before even saying hello? This is a serie about such person. One that does not know how to speak to people in real life, one that gets told in real life on his workfloor that he is useless and a nobody. So he goes home after work, plugs his Virtual Reality game in where his crewmember ingame are his employees and managers, so he can finally insult them for once and even do worse with them, just so the next day at work he shuts up again. This is very close to reality and many of us experienced many people like this in a online videogame. Some episodes are good ... some are bad. Some episodes will make you want to turn back in time because you've wasted an hour watching a boring one.<br/><br/>However , the episodes that are good are cleverly thought out and really does scare you because of the reality of the situations. Just as I was tired of all the futuristic dystopias whether the world is ruled by robots, everybody became fat and lazy, or resources are over and people are fighting for food, I came across this beautiful TV Series, instead of making people fear from what is already terrifying such as world hunger or short life expectancy, this show takes everything you love about the future, from artificial intelligence to nanotechnology and lets you see how it can go all wrong, and how it is more terrifying than evil robots destroying your home. If you've ever thought about the world and where it's possibly heading, this is your show. If you've ever thought at all, this is your show. True art of our time. I don't have time to watch tv but after watching the first episode, imma have to make time!!! Black Mirror is a unique and excellent show. <br/><br/>It is a blend of technology and human nature and the conflicts. This great anthology sets itself apart from so many shows in this way. You never know where an episode will take you and what the result will be, often this is dark. The creativity and new plot for each episode is a marvel to watch. For the most part it is hit and miss as some episodes are not as good as others. I think the best episodes are the crash between human conflicts and advanced technology. We can do with less of more focus being placed on human dramas that looks more like a soap opera. 
Overall very good show and a success for Netflix. <br/><br/>8.5/10 Black Mirror is an anthology show where a whole bunch of different stories take place. There's elements of horror, sci-fi, survival and others contained in 4, soon to be 5, seasons of 6 episodes each. <br/><br/>Each episode is self-contained in that they don't touch on any of the other episodes except in the most superficial way. For example in more than one episode they make reference to "brown suede" as a style of coffee. But there's no specific callbacks to any specific episode. It's more like these all take place within a shared universe.<br/><br/>There is a certain amount of darkness to it, after all it's not called "Black Mirror" for nothing. Social commentary is a thing and they use the show to reference this. Whether it's our addiction to things like Facebook, Instagram and how others see us all of these things are spoken of in one way or another. <br/><br/>I seriously tell anybody not to binge watch this as easy as it might be for you to do. Take the time to think about and digest the information and what the episode was trying to say and give yourself some time before firing up the next one. This is one of those series where you just have to push past that first episode to get sucked in completely. I agree with those who were offended, and I almost turned back, but I had the same experience at some point early in Breaking Bad, and we all know how that one went down. And although I was horrified by the first episode, I have to say that it actually was one of the post powerful and on target ones that deal with the dark power of social media. The writers are fearless. Black Mirror is one of the shows that I most anticipate the next season. And I love anthologies. There are not enough of them out there. Quite simply this show is an example of why it's worth watching television. Supremely talented writers with an ever improving budget and wealth of great acting talent creating satire and poking holes and turning our own reality, values and ideas about the world on its head. <br/><br/>This quite simply can not be missed, I've rewatched almost every episode multiple times. It's the rarity of a thoroughly enjoyable from a dark comedy and cerebral slice of modern world reflection. Black mirror can't be define with words. Every episode leave you with a lot of reflections Some episodes are incredible, others unfortunately not so much. Would give 10/10 but for some disappointing episodes. If Ray Bradbury wrote episodes of the Twilight Zone set on the cutting edge of near-future technology, it would be Black Mirror. You won't feel good after watching an episode. You will think and you may even cry. It's deep and intense and disturbing. That's the whole point. If you enjoy pondering the moral dilemmas of our modern age, you'll appreciate this show. I need a listing of any or all past British-led Speculative Fiction Based Anthology TV Series comparable to BLACK MIRROR. I am trying to determine if the Series is inadvertently DECONSTRUCTING the axioms prevalent within any previous British Anthology Speculative Fiction Based SciFi Horror and/or American legacies like Twilight Zone/Outer Limits. This series can be seen quite controversial and high amount of reviews on the both sides of the rates are to prove it. Either it was loved or hated. I guess it depends on the expectations of each viewer and how the seen would be interpreted. <br/><br/>Personally for me it is one of the best series I've ever seen that makes you think over lots of things, like where the society is heading towards and how technologies are bound to collapse with human nature. If you are on the other side rates or just about to watch the series, I'd like to give some of my personal hints that hopefully would explain you why it is so highly rated and what could be the way to understand it:<br/><br/><ul><li>don't take the plot for granted and don't try to take the direct story straight forward, usually the true message is more subtle or between the lines;</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>because the message is not so obvious, some commentators do complain they don't get this series. But one of the key points of this series - make the viewer think (about it) and have the freedom of the interpretation of his own. This said, if you're planing to watch it for a relaxed romantic Friday night - consider somewhat else. This series requires attention, it is not meant to have adventure type fun - it's meant to make you think.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>when watching the mainstream plot don't focus on how real it is or how likely it is to happen. It's not. And it's not the key point of the stories. For one thing - it's Sci-Fi, by the nature of the genre it cannot be real. Plus it can be exaggerated in order to help portray the "hidden" idea.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>(spoiler ahead) as an example, many commentators complain about first episode that this is totally unreal or that it was absolutely disgusting to watch therefore it's crap. But what is the idea behind that episode, what is the focus there? PM who's forced to do the indecent act? Or maybe the spectators/viewers who are so indifferent? Where is the line, what is decent nowadays, how far one can go showing and another observing? There are Jackass type videos where people may put fireworks in their butt naked asses, or prank by pulling down girl skirts publicly in the streets, harassing people, or news channels showing bloody, dead, disassembled bodies from war/blast zones and where's basically nothing covered or untold anymore, people cast videos of killings of their own suicides... Is this happening? Yup. Does any of it surprise you? Should it? Is all of it decent or disgusting? Have you noticed how the understanding of "decency" and "privacy" is changing with the time? How numb, insensitive people have become to things compared to the past. And how triggers to enforce feelings, like empathy, are becoming more and more stronger? How people nowadays go more extreme: more extreme news on TV, more extreme video on Youtube in order to have the "shock effect" and attract viewers. So how long will it take till we'll be watching PM having an act with a pig while having a nice cold beer considering it to be normal or maybe have an awakening? And that's just one moment in this episode. Another quick one - PM was a victim but did anyone care, like really care? Do we always care for victims? Is it "show that you care" or "do as you care"? How sensitive the society it to the pain of others? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's much more, but I will leave it for you. Just start asking all sorts of "Why...?" questions and spend time thinking over the answers. That may be the way to finding a discovery of your own.</li></ul> Pro tip : Do not give up on this series after the first episode - that one is a bit too freakishly bizarre <br/><br/>Extremely well done series. If you want to watch something that is really different with incredibly intelligent and fascinating writing, this is the show to watch. It is episodic and each episode has different characters and story, and most of them are simply amazing. It is set in a futuristic world where technology rules every aspect of human life. The underlying theme of the show is how humans adapt/react to extreme tech but the series is kinda timeless - it is all about exploring various aspects of the human nature in a thought provoking manner. Technology only highlights or draws attention in a (somewhat) quantifiable way to what is already the worst of human nature. <br/><br/>The episode 'Nosedive', for instance, is technology for social interaction/approval taken to extremes. Are you on social media? Are you popular on it? Are you unpopular on it? Do you like it? Do you hate it? - Doesn't matter which side you are on, just remember that everyone else is on the same thing, and whether or not you use it or how you use it says a lot about you and not about social media itself. Jerry Seinfeld says it best on Seinfeld - "It's very important for human beings to feel they are popular and well liked amongst a large group of people that we don't care for." This quote was with respect to voice mail and the time period was 90s. Nothing has changed, humans are still the same and will continue to be in the 'tech extreme' age too. I will begin by saying I absolutely love this show and I cannot wait for the next season. While majority of the reviews here are positive, some of the negative reviews are interesting. Most didn't get passed watching episode 1 of season 1, nor get passed the face of PM and the pig. This is an anthology series in which you take each episode separately. Further, so many have missed the messages behind the episodes. This series does a great job and showing the relationship between technology and psychology. Several episodes dive into deeper meanings of psychology and humanity. This is what I enjoy so much about this series, it is thought provoking. This is not the kind of series to watch and be simply entertained. You have plenty of that on TV. This series is for you to think. Hopefully, if you have found yourself not enjoying that first episode, I implore you to watch several other episodes. It gets even better. I especially enjoy the entire history of you, fifteen million merits, white bear, San Junipero, and men against fire. These are such great episodes. I do hope it does not lose the British influence though. I have watched so far through Episode 2 of Season 2. I have enjoyed this human experience; the show is terrific. The human acting is terrific, and the stories are mostly believable in a future world gone wrong. Kind of crazy, actually. I would write more, but... She is saying I need to go back up to the attic. I wanna say thank you to make this kind of series which shows us the real things happening in our world and with our humanity. this series made me to think deeply about the world, about the people we are living with, about me and our humanity. The quality of human being is going down... I heard human beings were the animals (monkey I guess)and now I think human beings are again becoming animals. or may be we are keeping update us (human beings and the world) and something going wrong with this updates.. we need to thing about this and we must do something. Black mirror what I supposed is the black screen, in other words technological screen. After a long time I liked some English TV series. This drama was dark, futuristic and so much scary that it took long time for me to be normal. The drama was brilliantly made. I won't say the first episode was not futuristic but the second and third was absolutely was. All the time it reminded me how scary can technology get through time. The first episode is based on modern time. It's a complete dark comedy. First two episodes signifies how pressure peer in modern or in near future can get scary. In the third episode it shows how people will lose their privacy day by day and it will increase as time will pass by. I consider this show as a masterpiece. Kudos for the Makers. The show is great and disturbing! I like how it exaggerates the problems with society and technology and gives a slight glimpse into how things could end up being. Each episode is it's own story line and there is almost always a great plot twist by the end. Although I enjoy the show it is very disturbing and there are times I find it hard to watch. If you do not enjoy twisted stories than this might not be the show for you. Black Mirror is the anthology series we've been wanting the UK to make in a very long time. Each episode is a self-contained story that could EASILY be used for episodes of shows like Doctor Who and such. The thing that makes Black Mirror so good is its exploration of futuristic utopias, how technology affects the world when we've reached a breaking point, and it's got the open-ended anthology nature of The Twilight Zone. It's basically a contemporary equivalent of Twilight Zone for the 2010s.<br/><br/>I love Black Mirror. I discovered it when Netflix revived the series in 2016, and the stories it tells are interesting and unsettling. Is all that happens in the world of Black Mirror the right thing to do? Do the character even know the difference between right and wrong? <br/><br/>See this show asap. It's not going to fizzle anytime soon; but get a Netflix account if you don't have one already. Excellent near-time Futurama of tech intersecting everyday society. Think original Twilight Zone with the thought-provoking ambiguity replaced by existing or near-future technology. Immediately alarming and insightful. As a technologist and father myself, the series easily captures your attention with solid acting and directing through intriguing story-telling that will stay with you beyond the episode's end. On Saturday night I watched 4 episodes of this series- "The Entire History of You", "Be Right Back", "White Bear" and "The Waldo Moment".<br/><br/>I had previously never heard of this series, so I'm not sure what channel this plays on (in England I assume?).<br/><br/>I was disappointed in the amount of foul language used throughout each episode, plus I was disappointed in the use of gratuitous sex in at least two of the episodes.<br/><br/>That said I thought they were quite interesting, and I wouldn't mind watching more of them to see what they are like. From reading the episodes descriptions, the rest of the episodes sound quite interesting. Reminds me of some other show, wonder what it is. Oh, yeah ! STAR TREK! Series 1: 7
this season is really good with awesome ideas and great music. i did feel unsatisfied after each episode. questions were unanswered and there were some possible missed opportunities. they left me wanting more. but i guess that's the way short stories are. individual ratings 6/10, 7/10, 7/10 (1 viewing)<br/><br/>Series 2: 7
individual episode ratings 7, 10, 5, 9. wow white bear, wow (1 viewing)<br/><br/>Series 3: 7
individual episode ratings: 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5 (1 viewing)<br/><br/>Series 4: 7
USS Callister 3.5, arkangel 3.5, crocodile 4.0, hang the DJ 3.5, metalhead 2.5, black museum 5.0 (1 viewing)<br/><br/>Bandersnatch: 7
pretty good episode on par with the average black mirror episode. but the interactive aspect was really cool and a fun experience. i was getting really into it (1 viewing)<br/><br/>Series 5: 4
individual episode ratings 1, 7, 4 (1 viewing) Originally had rated it 9 up through season 4. Season 5 was such a stinker I'm dropping the series to 7.<br/><br/>Honestly, did they fire all the writers and hire a bunch of kids? Season 5 was low quantity with only 3 episodes managed but more importantly very low quality. This is show is great, in its earlier content there are more twists in turns in each episode, as for its newest season, it seemed to be missing that factor. This season is why I didn't give it a 10, it was just unremarkable, but I still have hope that they will improve. I've watched with great enthusiam all of the seasons and in my opinion these last 3 pieces (meaning Season 5) don't do justice to the show. There is that familiar strange vibe, some good acting, some easy to relate to tech-society debates and a few star names in the cast. Still, when the credits rolled out after each episode I felt a bit dissapointed. The "fault" could be the fact that the show set such a high standard in the previous seasons and it was very hard to live up to everyone's expectations. I really hope this show will go on and the future series will continue to put our minds to work and to try to figure some stuff out. Our society needs this I think. Keeping a track of most liked episodes<br/><br/>S3
Men against fire Eventually get's too emotionla and boring to my opinion...
but it's sure as hell a mush watch and gives a very good perspective to the world we live in and the path humanity takes Great show, amazing actors, interesting and original plot lines, I can't get enough of this show. It definetly fills the deep empty longing that I had for a show similar to the Twilight Zone that I loved as a kid. The only negative for me is that I have to wait for new episodes after bingeing the first 4 seasons. My choice for the film review is Black Mirror - British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker where the series are not related to each other by plot, actors, time or place of narration. According to Brooker, all the subjects unite only satire on the way of life that is prevalent in the modern society. The cross - cutting theme is the influence of information technology on human relations. The series shows the modern life of mankind and all the problems that technological innovations bring to people's lives. In each series, people can recognize themselves. Black Mirror shows the world where technology burst into human life and took a solid place. Without computers, TVs, laptops, phone and other electronic devices people cannot imagine their lives. This kind of technique is called the "Black Mirror" of mankind. The World Wide Web has captured the billions people in its networks. Social networks swallowed the youth up. And it has already reached the point close to the situation where people cannot see the difference between reality and virtuality. During watching Black Mirror, person will see a realistic picture of the modern world, where people are ruled by technology. In order to clearly show the world with its own norms which is shown in Black Mirror, I will provide as an example one of the episodes of this serial which is called "Nosedive" - Series 3, Episode 1, where the whole life revolves around the rating in the social networks. High rating gives you a discount on the purchase of the real estate, luxury seats in an airplane, and the possibility of rapid career growth. The rating defines to which social class person belongs to; the higher ratings person has the more respect, kindness and privilege he receives. But the issue is that people in that world are ready to go on with a strained smile and fake feelings all their lives and forget about sincerity only in order to make their ratings to be on the top. If draw the parallel between our world and the world, represented in the episode "Nosedive", it will be obvious that there is a huge difference in the ways of living. In these two different worlds people have different concepts of norms of behavior; what is normal for "Nosedive" world, it is abnormal for our world. For example, if we make friends for the reason that we love them and enjoy the time spent with them, in the world from the series people are communicating with you only because someone has the high ratings in the social network. The significance of the ratings in the social network is so high, that the world became feigned in all senses. These kinds of norms which are being followed by the world from the "Nosedive" episode are abnormal for the world we are living in. Norm it is a standard of appropriate behavior, but since different societies have different standards, it can be concluded that they follow different norms which could be abnormal for others but normal for themselves. The sci-fi TV series starting with a horrendously disturbing episode yet turning out to be a minimalistic accent tv series is such a likable one which is indeed unique in itself. Every episode is not interrelated to each other and each episode till date is up to the mark to be called a black mirror episode. <br/><br/>The characters is really intense and have been appealing enough to leave a mark despite having around an hour of screen time. The stories are well written, and the direction is par excellence. Not to forget the cinematography, it never fails to attract, yet is a bit not equally good in a few episodes. The solo one hour episode with no relation to any background story nor requiring an explanation ultimately immersing the viewer in the story makes this show stand aside.<br/><br/>This show has indeed been one of my favorites and every episode has portrayed the sad yet actual face of our society which how in future could turn out to be a nightmare. This series also shows the beautiful impact of trchtechno on human lives, how it being crucial can some day turn out to be a bizzare spoilt mistake. This series in literal metaphorical term, is a mindbender. 'Black Mirror' is, in my opinion, a standalone in what it achieves. By exploring the dark side of futuristic technologies it really delves into the uncertainty and fear surrounding technological advancement and the fragility of the human mind. It poses the audience with very real and very relevant questions about where we are and where we're going and whether the progress we're making is truly progress at all. <br/><br/>Being an anthology series means that each episode of 'Black Mirror' offers a new and unique experience and story, whilst maintaining the common theme of technological advances. It's exciting because with each new episode you just don't know what you're going to get since they're often written and directed by a different team of people. Luckily, each episode and season benefits from an incredibly strong cast of talented actors that bring to life very real and interesting characters. However, the anthology organisation of the show is a negative as much as it is a positive, since each episode is very hit or miss. There are some episodes that are truly dreadful and that fall completely flat, whilst there are others that are brilliant masterpieces. Which ones are good vs which are bad, will all comes down to individual tastes but personally my favourites are, The Entire History of You, Nosedive, Shut Up and Dance, Hang the DJ, San Junipero, Playtest, Black Museum and White Christmas. <br/><br/>Each episode, whether you enjoy it or not, will leave its mark and is very representative of very real issues that we're debating today. Is it right to unnaturally preserve human life? Is it right to monitor your child's every move? Is it right to exploit technology to exact our own justice or revenge? Is it right to create unnatural technologies that defy nature and pose a danger to everyone that uses them? It's these kind of thought provoking and emotive moral dilemmas that 'Black Mirror' tackles with each episode and what makes it so brilliant. This sci-fi anthology series is basically a modern-day version of "The Twilight Zone." It features dark, bizarre tales taking place in the not-so-distant future focusing on technology and it's consequences. I've always liked anthologies and this is pretty good. If you're a fan of "The Twilight Zone" or "The Outer Limits," Give this a view. This futuristic series is just amazing. Most of the story line are unique, not something that you've watch a lot of times. I love how they try subtly connect the episodes. I can't say much because you have to watch it to know how good this is. :) Almost every episode in this extremely entertaining and thought provoking series tells us how technology changes our lives in different ways.
From the superbly disturbing first episode of it's first season to the extremely dark episode 'Black Museum' in its 4th season, every episode has something different to offer.
I'll just give you my 3 favorite episodes....<br/><br/>1.) S1 ep1 : The one thing that got my attention in the first episode was the plot itself. It was so absurd that I wanted to know what would happen, will he do it?<br/><br/>2.) S2 ep3 : Kinda unlikely that Waldo would rule the world right?
This episode kinda explores the possibility of what would happen when we get tired of our conventional politicians and choose an unconventional candidate..... Who then takes over the world, but an interesting story.<br/><br/>3.) S3 ep1: What happens when we're in a world where we're judged based on what we do?
This episode takes the concept of political correctness and jacks it with steroids.
What happens when you do stuff other people won't like, which would cause you to lose certain privileges. 
Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing in the role of the person who wanted to be accepted by everyone, but in doing so, she lost all her friends and realised it's so damn liberating speaking your mind.
This was easily my favorite episode. My rating of 7 is only about the 4th season. It isn't at the same level of previous 3 seasons, those I could rate them as 10. Just that. My oppinion. What are the Embedded Motifs evident in Black Mirrorverse? Are they inadvertantly subliminal and subversive or not? Suicide, Sadism, God-Complexes, Techno Worship, Masochistic Behavior and a more than curious Fetish for Pathological Absences of Conscience run amok as meta-themes. 
Is BLACK MIRROR 'mirroring' a darkly pessimistic overview of this generation's dysfunctional Speculative Future? I love Black Mirror and have been a fan since the first season on C4. It is very well written and I like the story telling and the cynical social commentary, I especially like it because it is cynical.<br/><br/>My only issue, at least with season 4, is that each and every episode has one fatal error or plot holes that rendered the stories pointless (and I cannot remember for sure but think also some of the older episodes from previous seasons had similar issues). Let me explain. <br/><br/><ul><li>USS Callister: how could she get access to his house, how could she just pop up on his balcony on the top floor?</li><li>Arkangel: they mentioned that the company did not get government approval to carry on, so how come the program still worked after 12 years of it being shut down?</li><li>Crocodile: self driving vehicles will obviously have all the journey data stored including speed. Actually current cars have that so how come they needed to rely on eye witnesses? Also, the ex boyfriend had a small trip on wooden floor, how come he was injured as severely as he was?</li><li>Meatalhead: The things are battery operated! She got the chance, on a couple of occasions, to disable it but she chose not to. Simply break the other legs while it was recharging, or blow it up while it was blind - simples.</li><li>Hang the DJ and Black Museum were actually very good - flawless..</li></ul><br/><br/>Brooker should know better. Black Mirror is a reality check. It is not a feel-good show, but manages to redeem its perturbing quality with its penetrating insight and indictment of mainstream society. It's m.o. is poignantly portraying and exploring the role technology is playing in our present through a series of futuristic, somewhat hyperbolized sci-fi scenarios where society has arguably mal-adapted to technological advance. <br/><br/>The thing isÂ… despite the futuristic setting, the show resonates intensely with the now, I guess, as good sci-fi should do. A sample of themes from season one:<br/><br/>-How absurdity, grotesqueness, and even violence have been trivialized to the extent of becoming entertainment at times. How trauma, depicted so readily on screens these days, has become something to watch primarily for stimulation. How, in many ways, we've become sadistic spectators or at best desensitized unconcerned bystanders. <br/><br/>-How a system that commodifies human life and energy (particularly lower and middle- class human life and energy) i.e. "a dead-end job" is maintained by aloof sociopathic elites through the brainwashes of materialism, distraction, and dream- selling. AND how society is complicit in this basically by being satisfied with the comfort of minimal needs being met, no matter how vapid and mundane this renders their life. <br/><br/>-How perfect memory, its storage, and recollection can be a double-edged sword. In a society where everyone has a brain implant that records and stores all audiovisual aspects of an individual experience for playback (and projection for all to see) at any moment, what issues will arise? How would you use it? To what extent would you relive your pains, your pleasures? To what extent would you fact-check your friends, family members, and lovers? To what extent would you chase clarity on events that happened outside of your experience, since you know an accessible recording exists in another person? <br/><br/>The subsequent seasons continue to tackle various heady and humane issues connected in some way with advanced technology (e.g. hacking, terrorism, virtual/augmented reality, racism, social media addiction, manipulated consciousness). Every episode is its own mental trip, has a twist, and most leave you with a sense of psychological vertigo. This probably isn't a show you want to binge-watch because, again, it isn't a feel good show due to its existential tone (even though it has some truly funny parts and scattered gems in the dialogue). But it IS a show that engrosses your mind and gut, and compels you to watch every episode. I like to think this show is like medicine: sometimes hard to palate, but necessary. I took off a star only because some of the endings frustrate far more than they satisfy which, all considered, might be the point. <br/><br/>Great show. Highly recommend. Started watching this show on Netflix over the weekend and I am hooked. Such a different show than anything on TV right now. Episodes make you think what the future could be like and how it may not always be such a great thing. Pros: Episodes feature different actors with different story lines, so no need to watch them in order (storyline does not continue from episode to episode) Cons: Need more episodes to watch! Good pickup Netflix! I find it very difficult to write a review of "Black Mirror" as a single series. It is made up of a series of very different pieces, which range from the heart-warming like "San Junipero" which is one of the best pieces of television that I have ever seen to horrifying to just kind of boring.<br/><br/>It is an interesting show, but each episode should be taken for what it is.<br/><br/>(I have seen it before, but I have mostly recently seen some episodes in June 2017) The only way I watch T.V. shows nowadays is by recommendation. There are so many shows that I could be completely consumed by them all and I can guarantee that over half of them are not worth my time. I actually heard about Black Mirror from a sports radio host and thought, "that sounds interesting."<br/><br/>I watched episode one of season three and was hooked. Just as a refresher: season three ep one was titled "Nosedive" starring Dallas Bryce Howard. It was about a world in which ratings are currency and clout. Every individual has a rating attached to him/herself that can be seen upon viewing the person's face. Using a five star rating scale, those with a higher rating have greater privileges whereas those with lower ratings are the scourge of the Earth. It was amazing to see what people would do just to get a five star rating (not too far from our current reality). <br/><br/>I binged watched that entire season then watched all three seasons. Just about every episode was genuinely thought provoking. These shows are extremely well done and offer so much food for thought. Each episode is replete with quality writing, quality effects and filming and quality acting. Black Mirror is a Netflix gem. It is Twilight Zone if it were rated R. Black Mirror is not a show for the weak of heart, those fragile in our society, those easily disturbed.<br/><br/>Black Mirror is for those of us who can take on the darker side of life without suffering a nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>The very first episode of this show is possibly the most disturbing piece of television I have ever watched. For many I would suggest skipping the first episode and re-visiting it later when you have become a little more hardened to this type of show. <br/><br/>Most of the one star reviews of this show are from folks totally repulsed by the first episode. It hits them so hard they couldn't cope!<br/><br/>Every episode of this show sends you a message from the writer. Sometimes that message is not welcomed....but it should always make you think!<br/><br/>The overall concept of the show is that technology is not a positive improvement in our lives.....the writer occasionally admits that it could be, if used properly (season 3, ep 4), but for the most part we are better off without technology, because it will be abused!<br/><br/>This is a show for the thinking person, who has a strong heart! If you don't like to be shocked, don't go anywhere near this show. <br/><br/>If you love to have you brain massaged....this is for you! This series shows you how dangerous can the world be if we let technology control us without any kind of limit.<br/><br/>I think the message "Black Mirror" tries to deliver to audience comes to the screen clearly enough with warnings, and i mean the shocking ones, like the episode S1,E2: "Fifiteen Million Merits" or S3,E1: "Nosedive", and the question always haunt you: "Could this reality be possible any day?".<br/><br/>My personal taste for entertainment always make me look for ideas well executed, where that be in books, music or TV shows, and this one right here has a flawless performance from all points of view than anyone like me expect when you sit on a chair or lie in bed and want something to look up to, to think with our very brains.<br/><br/>More stuff like this please: 8/10 This show is one of the best I've seen lately. It makes you think about arguable topics, and whether we should continue the technological developing trend or not. I also like the depressive settings which contributed to your involvement in this show. After episode 1 I could not stop watching anymore because it really intrigues me. However, not all episodes do play on your feelings the same. Some are much more personal than others, however, overall it did a great job and makes one really think about it.<br/><br/>All by all, I think each episode (I watched until now) was a masterpiece by itself and made me eager for more. The show also includes many innovative ideas which I think are also very interesting. Very bad bad bad very boring very bad
Bored time consuming
Baaaaaaaaad Okay, I only watched the first two episodes, but this isn't the kind of thing I'm into and it seemed pretty pointless.<br/><br/>In the pilot, the PM has to bone a pig or the abducted princess will be bumped off. The drama is tight - I can't fault that - but was there any real point to the episode? Afterwards, had I not just wasted 45 minutes?<br/><br/>The second episode shows some bloke who is apparently a slave to the gaming and online world. It should be a scary future, but it was as boring as hell! I managed just over 10 minutes of the episode before I turned it off.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no intention to see the 3rd episode or any from the other series... to me, it felt like a grossly over-rated programme. Maybe if you haven't read the classics, such as A Brave New World and 1984, this will all seem like an eye-opener for you, but, personally, I'd rather spend my time watching something completely different or being outside. Simply awful! I persisted until part way through EP 2 of S1! That's time I'll never get back.... Good stories, just why every movies insist to have nudity?? Wow!.you are going to think I'm off my rocker here! Season 5, Episode 1...Striking Vipers! Is a gender bending conundrum of two older built black males who like to play video games with each other in the future. One is married, and the other a rascally playboy of sorts.(he plays the female fighter)/ They go at it fighting kickboxing, etc....until they kiss. I don't want to drop any spoilers, but this show really makes you think about how men and women derive pleasure from sex. Is it nature or nurture? Without genitalia in a video game, how would you derive orgasmic release? Would it matter what animal you were or gender? Quite intellectual on one hand and eye opening on the other. For mature audiences only of course. Enjoy the sexual imaginings of your own psyche as you watch this! Fun! Murf I'm not sure if the first few episodes are just particularly bad, or if they are all this way. It basically reminds me of the Twilight Zone. But instead of thought provoking (certainly the case for the pilot) it's based almost entirely on shock value. After watching the first few episodes all I felt was cheated for my time. 15 million merits seemed as though it was hinting at something great with the dystopian future angle but ultimately the end had me feeling like I had wasted my time. Wasn't quite sure how to rate this show because there were episodes that I just couldn't get into, and some were so strange it was hard to follow. The episodes that I did completely watch and understand were great tho. Very outside the box kind of thinking went into the storylines clearly and that makes for some refreshingly new plots. The psychology behind the episodes is definitely interesting. My only problem is that not every episode is as interesting to me. But the nice part is that the episodes are individual and so if you don't like an episode you can just skip to the next one! I've seen a few different ones and some of them were very intense, and definitely great to watch. Gives you a lot to think about I think this show might be one of the most important shows our new young generation of humanity has been miraculously gifted lately. This show can send us some of the most disturbing truths out there that we, today's rats, consumers, and sheeple have to adopt and understand. This show is a must. This show really captures where we are currently heading as a society! It is the most perfect "use caution with tech" tale I could imagine! Such a great show, it's so sick but so interesting. I love most of the stories! Metalhead in S4 was awful. Worth a watch, check it out people! It's on netflix and it's really really good!!!! Each episode,different subject,well written scenario its a good serie.Impressive explain the development of technology.Technology and the future.Benefit or harm.Good series.Very good. Black Mirror presents to the public, with sci-fi and drama stories, the consequences of technology evolution in a future society. Created by Charlie Brooker, the British TV show won the International Emmy Award in 2012 as the best TV show in the year.<br/><br/>Presenting a completely different plot for each episode, the series, divided into 4 seasons, uses issues of our actual society mixed with future technologies and how the people would use it. The most stories approach dark themes, insisting to make a reflection about artificial intelligence and the ethical issues about it. <br/><br/>Despite the sci-fi side, we can relate each plot treated with nowadays issues and really see in this memorable TV show a mirror of our society and people's reactions. The viewer can put himself in the character's place and try to imagine what choice would take in each situation.<br/><br/>Using a mind blowing scene in the end of the episodes, Black Mirror makes you stop and think about right and wrong, where we will be and what we will be doing in the future, how the technology can affect us. All this context is perfect for the sci-fi lovers, who would easily spend all day long to watch all seasons in sequence. ... And I'm enjoying every single second of it.<br/><br/>
 Introduction<br/><br/> For a long time, we, entertainment consumers, have been fed relatively conservative content steadily. For a while, Parent Guiding certification (PG-13, etc...) had been enough to the majority of mainstream production companies out of ''risky'' markets such as R-rated movies, TV-MA shows and the likes, because the consensus was that they were missing out on full market capitalization with their content ; Making movies/tv for a part of the market was less lucrative than targeting broader range of audiences. <br/><br/> However, today, because of the abundance of media content, we see a market that is split into multiple sub-genres with a loyal following that will often barely venture out it's own personal preferences, if at all ; If one of those sub-genre gets a large enough representation, However Niche and unusual it is, Content is gonna be produced and producers will capitalize on the market opportunity. 
 
 What we get is a bunch of ruthless TV shows, like Black Mirror, like Game of Thrones, etc... Shows specifically engineered to satisfy our own sick desires and to fulfil our most deranged fantasies. The human mind is twisted, and companies like Netflix and HBO have understood and capitalized on it. 
 
And you know what ? I'm Grateful for it ; I came for entertainment and that's exactly what I get
 <br/><br/> Review<br/><br/> Black Mirror, is a built on a bold concept. At it's core, the show takes contemporary concepts and technologies, enhances them and builds realistic, dystopian-societies, set in the near future, around those technologies. It's purpose is to demonstrate that technology and power are not good nor evil. They are simply tools, used as an extension of the wielder's will. ANY technology can and WILL be used for Creation and/or Destruction given the right circumstances.<br/><br/> Being an Anthology series, it gives the show the ability to visit a lot of different worlds and societies. As a sci-fi fan, the opportunity to explore as much individual, unrelated universes as possible, each containing their own set of characters and stories to explore is a feeling that can't be explained.<br/><br/> The show can be enjoyed for what it is, an explicit demonstrations of the eventual problems associated with modern day technology through dystopian societies closely resembling our own, misusing enhanced version of the devices we use everyday. In that sense, it plays as an original Sci-fi, Drama, Thriller with a lot of plot twists.
 
 However, It can also be enjoyed for what it represents, and that's the best way to enjoy it in my opinion. It's fascinating to see how a lot of the things we take for granted and assume is harmless or to improve society and human condition is merely a perspective, and the show makes a very good job a demonstrating that point ; I've never been more scared of X-factor, Facebook and Brain Electrodes...
 
 What's interesting is that even though a lot of these world feel incredibly alien, they still feel somewhat familiar and instinctive, because they are built around how the human race dealt with a concept or technology in the past, leading to such extreme changes in comparison with todays society, even though, they are not set that far appart in time. 
 
 What's amazing, is that every one of those societies is a possible outcome for our own human race. The problems and dysfunctions at the root of each dystopian societies portrayed in Black Mirror are based on current issues, and the way we do or do not deal with them will help shape tomorrow's society into what could be an aberration of it's former self, as shown in Many Episodes of Black Mirror.<br/><br/> I personally enjoyed the lack of a regular cast that appears in every episode. I think that ongoing character development associated with a recurring character in a TV show encourages lazy writing, because they can always change something or add some flash-back to fix an issue with character/plot. Being an anthology series, each episode is a definitive, final version of a story, including it's protagonists. It also plays as a motivator for actors to give good performances, as they only appear in a single episode (for the most part). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a lot of quality, established actors.<br/><br/> The best episode of pretty much every season as been the finale, which to me, indicates that the show's producers are in touch with what makes their show successful and good, especially in an anthology series where the finale's appreciation is not influenced by plot cliff-hangers or events that have been built-up for a whole season. This means hey are likely going to be able to replicate their formula for years to come, and that they didn't just get lucky. On top of that, the Show's success could attract big name actors as the format of the show is not overwhelming on an actor's calendar<br/><br/> This is the TV show I've been wanting for years without knowing it. I've seen so many movies/tv-shows that presented original, intelligent, ambitious concepts, but ended up compromising what made them special to comply to social conventions. Swapping their bold eccentricity, mid movie for sheer, bland normality. Thankfully, that time has come to an end we can finally see how alien, twisted, and scary the world could be or have been, with a push in the right direction. It is very thoughtful, sometimes deep and revolutionary.
Season 4 is so bad, some episodes are disgusting like the first of season1 , some others have a good point and idea but too long and overstretched incidents like the second.

Overall Score: 4.01/5 Black Mirror, for me, went through a different phase each season. I will use these phases as building blocks to review the series as a whole. <br/><br/>Start-up: At this point, the series was new, wild, very confronting and, unfortunately, completely unknown to the outside (read: non-BBC) world. Everything was right. The creator had an idea and he made it happen on the small screen. In my opinion, the best episodes were created in this season for just that reason. While underrated, the brilliance caused the series to earn a second season. <br/><br/>Growth: This is when I picked up on the series because it got better and more reviews overall. I really enjoyed every episode except the very first one and I could only hope for more brilliance from the creators. The writing was excellent and the concept was still incredibly cool and unique. <br/><br/>Maturity: The series achieved its peak with the White Christmas episode. The show got a broader fanbase and Netflix decided to throw money into the concept to scale it up to six episodes a season. This was the moment I, and with me probably many more, got very excited for the future of the series. However, the new episodes were still enjoyable but every fan knew this was not the rebellious and brilliant series it used to be. It lost its touch with its core, which mostly showed in the unusually happy episode San Junipero. Don't get me wrong, that episode was brilliant, but not as 'Black Mirror' as the striking episodes in the beginning (like Five Million Merits) used to be. <br/><br/>Decline: I watched the fourth season right when it came out, and I let it sink in for a few months before I wanted to write this review. There was not a single episode that got me on the edge of my seat, and there was not a single episode that really got me thinking. What I loved about Black Mirror was the challenge it gave us to look differently at (all our behavior with) technology. However, this season, more than ever, let the good guys win, had inexplicable and unreasonable plots (instead of technology, it were the people causing bad events) or it was outright not 'black' at all (Hang The DJ, which I will review separately because of its wasted potential). <br/><br/>For me, Black Mirror has ended. It was great as long as it lasted. But every great concept like this was great because it was what it was at the time: a niche. A niche talking to a specific audience that wants to be challenged. When Netflix wants to produce more episodes in a shorter time window, it comes at a cost. The cost of the niche that I valued so much at the beginning of the series. So right now, it is time to find a new niche series to enjoy. Probably the best show ever made, at least up there, and will probably continue to get better. It's unfair to compare this series to The Twilight Zone. Unfortunately, that's the only comparison available. Additionally,with such a variety of writers and directors, the range of styles and methods of execution make it a collage. The common threads are the producer, a dystopian view and British film/TV Movie making sensibility.<br/><br/>Many episodes could stand on their own as full theatrical releases. A few need not have been made. Taken in its entirety, the body of work is genius. It will likely remain viable for generations as the technologies foreseen will be compared to the similar technologies that will become reality. Where Series such as Star Trek and Star Wars futurist views are defined by the movie making technology of the time, this series is defined by the creative talent and imagination of the production staff. Like I said, British. Fortunately, this wasn't (or has not yet) been f'd up by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Reading some of the reviews are, as other non US series of movies, not fully appreciated by the US audience. It lacks the typical banality and requires an intellect or education level beyond the US electorate to fully appreciate the work.Clue, there's no laugh track or formula or predicable outcome. Sorry Trump supporters, this one requires a brain. As a kid, I was raised on the Twilight Zone. It is fair to say that Black Mirror is the best series I have come across. Every episode is its own plot with its different cinematography, soundtrack, and characters. It is a series that has perfected their own thought provoking, futuristic, mind blowing screenwriting. <br/><br/>Just as Twilight Zone was set in the future, so is Black Mirror. But it is not too radical of a futuristic rendition, rather it is just a small step forward on technology we have today. Black Mirror uses this aspect in ways to engage a emotional connection in its advantage<br/><br/>Every episode is great, Every season is great, we need more! - Ansel Ponce Diama REVIEW - BLACK MIRROR <br/><br/>Let me start with a little explanation, Black Mirror is a series made up of separate stories, so from one to another each is different. <br/><br/>That being said even though each episode is a different story one thing they have in common is that they are original. <br/><br/>Some episodes are scary, some make you think and some are just strange but each is compelling viewing. <br/><br/>As each episode is its own story if you don't like the subject of one skip to the next because so far there are 4 series (UK) seasons (US) to watch so I can guarantee you'll find something. <br/><br/>Stories original, scary, beautiful, brilliantly acted and a must watch! <br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10 I just love this show. Nothing makes you think like Black Mirror.<br/><br/>It's definitely not for everyone, but if you manage to look past the bizarreness, pig f***ing etc. you're in for a treat. I've had hours and hours of debates with friends about the show. Sharing and hearing opinions about the episodes is the best, because people notice different things and have different takeaways from each. It broadens your horizons and gives you a new perspective on life and the future.<br/><br/>SEASON 4
It's a shame it had to go mainstream and everything is now feeble and watered down for the masses. I know it can be f***ed up at times, but I actually watch BM for the bizarreness and the pig f***ing.<br/><br/>Half of the episodes just didn't make sense (memories from DNA?) and the other half had weak twists or flat endings. Before this season, everything was outrageous, but believable and maybe not too far off into the future. Now it just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I expected more from BM this season and it didn't live up to it, but it's still the best show I've ever watched.<br/><br/>
Favorite Season: 3
Favorite Episode: Shut Up and Dance (Radiohead, duh) "Black Mirror" is a science fiction series that opens a window and lets us peek into a future that seems to be getting closer and closer.
 IÂ´m a fan of this show since it started in 2011 and despite its acquisition by Netflix in Season 3, nothing has been lost in terms of creativity and every episode of this Season 4 continues to offer us stories in a future that feels more and more present. By the way, this is the characteristic that I like the most in this show, the future is strangely familiar and plausible, as if what we are seeing can actually happen in an increasingly technological world that still keeps much of what we know today.
 Each episode presents us with a new story with new themes and characters, always maintaining the background that characterizes the series, a future that may be more or less black and dystopic and in which we are confronted with the consequences of the use of technology in the evolution of the society and the human being.
 There are always many and complex questions that stand at the end of each episode and insist on staying in our thoughts. Perhaps because of this, "Black Mirror" is a reference to the effect of a TV screen or computer that, when off gives a dark reflection of the viewer.
 My favorite episode continues to be "Nosedive" of Season 3, which shows a society that lives by the rules of a social network and where the success and happiness of each one is decided by the evaluations given by others (it does remind us of something familiar, does it not? ). 
 This season, the episodes "USS Callister" and "Hang the DJ" are my favorites, the first being a satire to the classic sci-fi shows, full of black humor and that makes us think to what extent virtual clones are conscious beings, and the second a vision of relationships and soul mate search through algorithms of an advanced virtual dating system.Thanks Netflix for having started the year in the best way and I can only hope that this is just the beginning of a 2018 full of such good quality series.
GOOD - creativity, innovation, black humor, the ability to surprise, reminiscences of "The Twilight Zone", thinking the future
BAD - few episodes
VERDICT - excellent, a must see Charllie Brooker's Series 'Black Mirror', just having released its 6 episode fourth season on Netflix, is must-see story-telling for the current developing age of homo technologus, where feeble humans cope with what their age of apps and smartphones have wrought and are wreaking.
Each story can be considered on its own. Here is a tale of a husband paging through the memory chip in his head that augments his ability to recall events and discovering a new view of his wife. There is a tale of what can happen when an electronic bee-hive is hacked. All are tales of the near future so close we are almost touching it.
We can agree or disagree with how the writer sees the issues, but I think the issues are already there.
There is plenty of homage to go around to the best of sci-fi prognositicators, I would mention the creator of Twilight Zone, Rod Serling, and I would mention Philip K. Dick as a mentor as well. But Charlie Brooker works them into the perceptions of NOW. This show is amazing! I watched the whole third season yesterday and never saw "the dark side of technology" that everyone else seems to see. The black mirror in Mexican culture is a magical object which reflects different aspects of the human nature - exactly as does technology here; it is not an actor, just an instrument. And just as any other instrument, it can not make life better or worse without human intervention. So, if the series are showing a dark side, it is the dark side of humans, not of technology. Even in "Hated in the Nation", where technology is so advanced that it almost seems to have a will of its own, there is a human actor and a human motivation. Moreover, in episodes like "San Junipero" things look sparklingly positive and in many others - they are ambivalent. But I suppose the series themselves are yet another black mirror reflecting the human fear of technology, thus the one-sided perception. The best mini series ever seen, all episodes are amazing even some of them seemed Similar but all stories are brilliant , the most episodes i like are ;
White Christmas, Hated in the Nation, Men Against Fire, Fifteen Million Merits & White Bear . for now iam waiting for season 4 ,so if you like drama you will see it as a piece of art . Black Mirror is a show that provides the important modern question that is very meaningful especially in this day and age. "Can technology go 'too' far?" <br/><br/>To put it very simply, it's sort of a modern form of the Twilight Zone. The show is easier to comprehend if you treat each episode as it's own separate universe. It has somewhat of a formula. Each episode, there is a problem. However, there is a piece of new tech that perfectly tackles the problem. Or so you think. Unseen consequences come with this tech, creating a problem equal to/ worse than before. For a show that sometimes follows such a basic formula, the plot is always fresh, new, and most importantly, interesting and thought provoking.<br/><br/>There's a sort of unique feeling you get while you're watching Black Mirror. A mixture of horror along with the morbid intrigue of watching a car accident. A wonderfully constructed car accident at that. The further you go, the more horrified you are, but at the same time, are presented with a plot that unfolds brilliantly. <br/><br/>The only preventing me from giving this a 10/10 was the fact some episodes were slightly dull in production. In any other show it would've been a good episode, however in the standards that Black Mirror sets within itself, some were lackluster. Also, this show does not appeal to all. This is clearly visible even in this review section. There are either 8-10 ratings or 1-3 ratings. It's like geometry. You either like it, or you don't. <br/><br/>Of course, there are complaints in this review section. A common complaint is about the first episode. In the first episode there is a scene where the Prime Minister is forced to rape a pig. That scene of course was very obscene. And I can imagine a good amount of people were disgusted by that. They immediately saw the scene, exited out of the Netflix and probably ranted online about how bad it was. They accuse Black Mirror of relying purely on shock value alone. This is far, far from the truth. The whole episode was to show how someone can influence a population with a few posts online, and how effective it can be. They essentially criticized Mob Mentality, showing how flawed it really is. If you cannot find a pretty clear message from a television show which explicitly states it's lesson, you're probably a bit to young to watch this show. The pilot sucks so naturally the show could have only gotten better from there. The pilot is about a ransom for a kidnapped princess. The ransom being that the future prime minister must Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo a pig. So avoid the pilot. Season one was otherwise simple. The special episode 'White Christmas' was the best episode in the show and its not just because John Hamm stars in it but everything is awesome about it. Hayley Atwell stars in an episode in season two but that episode was average. Watch Nosedive that has Bryce Dallas Howard in it and its her best performance ever. I now have so much respect for her and the show. Almost every episode in seasons 2 & 3 are better than the pilot and season 1. These episode are all differend, you can start with a random episode. Each episode contains a differend story and that makes it so awesome! I recommend this series for all the people who likes a little mindblow. All the episode has a story in the future, past or present. <br/><br/>Pro Tip: Don't give up on the first episode, i found the first one a little bit to much, but on the other hand it was interesting how it can be if it was bassed on a true story. Excellent Performance As My friend told about this and he gave a good review. No matter which Language is used in the film.<br/><br/>IMDb is a great website and providing excellent services to their customers. <br/><br/>Excellent Performance As My friend told about this and he gave a good review. No matter which Language is used in the film.<br/><br/>IMDb is a great website and providing excellent services to their customers. <br/><br/>HTTP://www.ertekaz.com/en This show puts a spin on modern and futuristic (not so distant future too) technology and how it is impacting our culture as a whole. How we as a people view it and each other as a result of our attachment to that technology. It makes you turn back on yourself and say "I could really see that happening someday" in some and "oh man, I do that all the time!" in others. Kind of reminds me of how The Outer Limits was done back in the 90's just re-imagined for today's viewer, there is some message to be understood from each one. Each episode is completely different than the last, constantly keeping you on your toes while still keeping things fresh and new. My only request is that they get some more funding so we can start getting longer seasons! Black Mirror is a trip to the "what if" realm......<br/><br/>Unlike its title, the stories presented are not always dark and dystopian. Its a mixed bag, of cautionary, horror but also at times, genuinely uplifting and even moving, tales from the "other side". <br/><br/>The standard of storytelling, predictably, varies. Sometimes there is real flair and inspiration on offer. Other times, the tales can be rather unremarkable and occasionally, boring. That said, as a guide, I'd say this series is more polished than not. <br/><br/>Season three, sees a departure from UK only based episodes and offers up imaginings from the US as well. Its a good move, that works well, breaking up the UK centric feel of the show. <br/><br/>I like Dark Mirror and hope for more in future. Seven out of ten from me. Ingenious writing of the highest form. One of, if not the best, series I have ever watched. Every episode gifts the viewer with the element of surprise, not only in terms of subject, but through the unfolding of the unique plot as well. A trait very rare in today's ocean of diluted series, whom often do not have the intellectual ability to achieve total unpredictability as well keep the viewer enslaved to their screens (ironically) from start to finish. While I selfishly would love for more episodes to a season, I understand that this is what will doom the show. Black Mirror is, indeed, a case of quality over quantity with its ingenious concepts and authentic story lines. This is nothing short of excellent. It is intelligent above all, and I think that is the most attractive feature. The concepts addressed in this show are deep and meaningful; the sort of things we should all take time to contemplate in our daily lives. I especially love that each episode is a different story exploring a different scenario - its refreshing and engaging, at times making you feel as if you are experiencing everything first-hand, because the protagonist in each tale is someone we can all relate to. I really hope more and more people get to see this. A deep thank you to the creators and contributors! Black Mirror - season 3 - Episode 1 - White Christmas is by far the craziest audiovisual trip in a long time. A Twist most likely to those times of Master David Lynch himself. I mean I see here influences from so many films, TV series, but put those influences all together in one episode is a riddle of not so many. To what levels do you let your mind go? Is that enough to write about it? Is that good to film it? Do you think people will pay for that? What do you wanna show? What do you want them to know? Do you think you can handle the story out? Right from the beginning? Well, think again... Black mirror makes you wonder. Wonder more. Black mirror is a blend of crucial elements in order to lift off from your mind, your most intense stimulus and feeling. it is unbelievable wise - outrageous Wow. Amazing show, have no idea why this TV show is not more popular these days. These drama represents the essence of the human being, a mesmerizing show that sometimes make you feel trap and looking for a way out. Seeing all the chapters of this production make you thinking in your life and in some ways feel bad for the characters of the show, because sometimes you think that some things of this drama (like the loneliness) can really happen to your life in any moment. I need to say that the writers of Black Mirror are bad-ass. Just when you think all the good shows are done, I find these magnificent production by a comment in Twitter. The technology will dominate us someday, I have no doubt at all. This is just a preview. One of the Best series which can keep you entangled with standalone episodes. Been on my watch list for years. But once I started it I never knew how it all ended just in a day. Charlie Brooker's knowledge on Human mentality is epic. All the things that are shown in series are actually plausible. People are losing their empathy as it is not of any financial value.<br/><br/>Each and every episode of this has made me think for hours.<br/><br/>My personal favorites from the first two seasons are<br/><br/>1.The National Anthem. <br/><br/>2.The Entire History of You.<br/><br/>3.The White Christmas.<br/><br/>4.The Waldo Moment.<br/><br/>5.15 Million Merits.<br/><br/>6.Be Right Back. Black Mirror takes a step forward in looking at the darker side of technology and social trends to a level of creativity I have not seen before. With each episode being it's own story, there are some losers in there. That being said, the concept is so good I have to look paste them and applaud the creativity and application of science fiction that isn't so far in the future that it is a guess. Much of the technology used in the shows is in some stage of development (not all, most) making the future feel like next generation. The highlight is in how from a social and psychological standpoint close it is to where we are today. The general sense is a bit of twilight zone mixed with next generation technology mixed with possible evolution of social or application of the tech from a darker perspective. Taking this next generation technology and exploring what hackers could do with it, how it could be used/misused by those in power, and other variations on this theme. The one thing I found in common was that how many times I had no intention of watching an entire episode only to watch it, and the next, and the next. Quite Addicting and well thought out with hopes that Netflix (which from what I can tell has taken it over) has done to improve it and increase the episodes. Hoping the upward trend continues and the creativity not lost. One of the best shows I've accidentally watched. if it had more episode it would beat breaking bad, walking dead ,daredevil even game of thrones .<br/><br/>i don't know why it is not one most famous TV series ever created.<br/><br/>features speculative fiction with dark and sometimes satirical themes that examine modern society, particularly<br/><br/>with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies.<br/><br/>it takes you to edge of dark human nature and in awkward scenario in which people may exhibit so extreme behavior.<br/><br/>its a must watch if you liked GOT, BB ,TWD ,daredevil like me ... you will love it like me .<br/><br/>a different stuff that rest of them all combined . each episode with a new theme . no connection between episodes. I had no expectations starting this series nor had i any idea of what it was about. Ever episode brings something new and always blows my mind away. At least for the first two seasons and the Christmas special. This show brings out the worst aspects of the human race and blows it out of proportion. That is what makes this show so disturbing yet so entertaining. I am one who loves disturbing shows with an intelligent story, and this show is perfect. I like the fact that ever episode is independent from one another, this widens the reach of the show, being able to cover many topics and different aspects. The pacing is great, screenplay is wonderful and the direction is on point for the most part. with that being said, the third season was slightly disappointing. i'm not saying that the latest season was bad. it's just nowt as good as the previous seasons. i did not find the latest season (3rd season) as intelligent or as disturbing as the previous ones. however, it did improve in the direction and the screenplay. overall, this is still one of m favorite series of all time. I watch very little tv but since a friend recommended it I have been hooked and love talking to anyone else who has seen any episodes. Highly recommend This series is in a way outrageously disturbing. It is not science-fiction as usual, but it is science-fiction from a systematically vengeful and sadistic point of view. The six episodes have no alternative meaning and that's why they are poignant in a way because even though we know it is going to be sadistic and vengeful, we do not know how it is going to develop and the punch line is always flabbergasting.<br/><br/>USS Callister is the story of a power-hungry man who is in real life servile and even humbly spineless. He is a game programmer and as such he invented a game of virtual reality in which he can be himself as he would have liked to be, dominant, powerful, a real slave owner who, in the game, is always successful and can transform the team members of his USS Callister into monsters. The interest is that the team members in this virtual reality game are real people imprisoned in this VR spacecraft via their DNA. Of course, they only are copies of their real selves that stay in the real world. But they have to submit to Captain Robert Daley or they are transformed into monsters that can be killed and revived as many times as Mr. Captain wants and what's more he can capture the children of these team members by getting their DNA and he can torture the VR copy of the children in front of the eyes of the team members who are copies of the parents whose children's copies are being tortured. But what happens when a new "member" is brought into the team who does not want to play the game?<br/><br/>Arkangel shows a mother who decides when her daughter is still young for a reason that does not justify the decision, to implant in her a sort of GPS that enables the mother to see the world through her daughter's eyes on a screen. The mother becomes invasive and she for a short while decides to put the screen away and keep it dormant. But that will not last when her daughter is a teenager and able to have love relations with boys. I just wonder what it would have been if she had preferred girls. The mother gets crazy when she finds out one boy actually drugged her daughter to rape her. That will lead to the final crisis and both mother and daughter will get out of it deeply bruised.<br/><br/>Crocodile brings another mind-reading device, this time it is able to go back in time and read the memories of people. Imagine the drama that can come from anyone if they were able to know exactly how the people, they were dealing with felt about them and about themselves. You can meet very dangerous people in the street, and it is better not to know. If you can then you will panic. And the story is ending in some sort of banal conclusion that it is always better not to know what other people think of you and what they think of when they are with you.<br/><br/>Hang the DJ is just a crazy dating system that brings together people, always one man and one woman, no anti-LGBTQI segregation at all, of course not, but there is always a time limit that becomes a time frame that has to be respected and when it is short it is always too short and when it is long it is always too long. In this dating world, where people do nothing at all but wait for their date, date them and then wait for the end of it to have a new prey provided by the system, and the word "prey" is the only word that fits. What happens when one person falls in love with his/her date and when this date falls in love with him/her? There apparently is no escape. So welcome to permanent and recurring frustration with no compensation or escape at all. Sinister. The very end is the negation of anything human you may believe in.<br/><br/>Metalhead is mysterious. It is the story of some kind of animal, outside in the real world that got in a way killed or destroyed and the kid attached to it is wanting, not desiring, absolutely wanting, absolutely haunted by his demand based on his deprivation, is wanting then a replacement. Three people try to enter the warehouse where they could find a replacement. It is abandoned except that it is under the control of some mechanical dog that is - or in fact, are - but one is enough, entrusted with the responsibility to get rid of the intruders. They are AI dogs that have tremendous technical powers and psychological understanding of human beings. Wait and the humans will always end up doing what will cost them their lives. More drastically pessimistic than that you die. Not me of course. It is a show and nothing else.<br/><br/>Finally, Black Museum is by far the best because it reveals the real nature of humans, you know these entities that some people call men and women. Here we are essentially dealing with men who are perverts and live on the nasty suffering they impose onto other people. Imagine a VR-being or a Tussaud's mannequin in which the experience of the highest suffering of the real man represented by the mannequin is embedded and that he could be forced to relive artificially this moment on command from the visitors of the museum. Imagine the sadistic people coming to that museum just to electrify a guilty character who was electrified and have this VR character relive entirely his suffering when he was executed. Sadistic I said. And in this case, the end is absolute and plain justice. Vengeance will come sooner or later, and it does come in the film.<br/><br/>In our world today, there is a deep vein of vengeful sadism in all or most people. Is there any exception? And modern means of entertainment enable these vengeful and pain-hungry perverts to satisfy their perversion, thirst, and hunger for pain, blood, suffering, torture, etc. This is deeply revealed in these episodes. But what our real concern is that these perversions are not only virtual even if they are mostly satisfied virtually. Is it catharsis? I am not sure at all because of the level reached by some people who are your next seat neighbor on a train, a plane or a bus. And catharsis requires the regular and recurring release of the violence of this death instinct in us for this very catharsis to last more than an instant, more than the length of a TV episode. It could be seen as some kind of feeding of the perversion, keeping it alive and "vital" since the subjects cannot survive if they do not have their portion of perverse fodder, their pound of fresh bleeding flesh. Are human beings becoming the perverse cows raised and fed on the bloody hay of these perversion-providers?<br/><br/>So, enjoy your perverted onanism on these VRTeleConference TV-episodes. Enjoy the drinks.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU Black Mirror - Netflix's hit sci-fi drama is back with its fourth season. While the first three seasons raised the bar for sci-fi dramas, a lot is expected from the fourth season. Will the makers live up to the sky high expectations of their fans? Does it get repetitive?
First off would like to make it clear that we are not on the payroll of Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. But when these compete with each other to give us the best content, we can't help but be in awe. Like in any other season the latest season consists of a bunch of standalone episodes. Some episodes have some familiar faces in terms of TV celebs. Each episode speaks about the perils of technology & how adversely it will affect us in the future. The scripts are one of the best we have seen. Each episode got us thinking & stayed with us post the show.
The fourth season is similar in execution as compared to the previous season. The episode about the dating app simulation was our favorite. The first episode about an IT honcho, who has made his fantasies come true in his own private world sets the tone for the remainder of the series. New viewers will have no difficulty whatsoever following the show. 
Black Mirror is easily one of the most flawless show on Netflix. The only hitch is that since there are no recurring characters, it fails to build an emotional connect with its viewers. But you can;t have it all can you? What it lacks in emotional connect, it makes it up in freshness. each episode is diverse from the others.
Please do not miss this show for anything under the sun! I am a new IMDB user, usually I rate TV series, movies, by just giving it a rating to my friends or recommend it to them. But Black Mirror is a different story, oh yes. This piece of art here, deserves much more of my attention, and I mean a lot more. <br/><br/>Currently I am in Season 4, Episode 3, but I have plenty of reasons to write this review. I accidently started with season 4 episode 1. Didn't know what the hell was going on, but it was good so I decided to watch Episode 1 season 1. And it was an entire different story, a different setting. At the end of it, I was just blown away. While I thought that the entire series was based on what I saw in s4 episode 1. It showed me how powerful these episodes are, that even one single episode could make me watch an entire TV show of it. And that's what Black Mirror delivers, it delivers great mini-movies. Black Mirror tries to hold a mirror infront of you, or someone around you. Some of it may confront you with personality traits that you own. It also shows that science evolves faster than our own instincts and how to deal with science when it's combined with desires in general. Making us question if technology is a step forwards or a step backwards. <br/><br/>If you haven't watched Black Mirror, then wait no longer! You have no idea how great this TV show is. It's a rare piece of art that is hard to come by. The only thing that will be saddening for me, is what the hell will I watch after this? To me no other TV show can actually compete let alone be compared to what this art is.<br/><br/>A big fat 10/10 for me! I wasted quite some time now reading reviews. To at least put some sense into that time invested, I decided to write my first (as far as I remember...) review here:<br/><br/>This show is not for everyone.<br/><br/>You need to be intelligent to enjoy this show.
If you're not ready to deal with seeing a man having sex with a pig, even if it's only in a fictional TV show, don't watch this. If you already have watched the first episode and got scared away, this simply wasn't right for YOU.
It helps to have some experience in still getting the point of a story despite of very disturbing scenes.
You could use at least a rough overview on technology trends to understand this show.
Don't expect a story spanning several episodes. It doesn't, and that's INTETIONAL!
This is not a documentary. It's fictional. It uses "unrealistic", exaggerated elements.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this show is outstandingly brilliant!<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer, leading a team responsible for user interface development for machines aiming at innovation leadership. I can relate closely to many of the technological aspects Black Mirror deals with. Yet having watched up to S4E4, this show is a perfect match to what a person like me might expect from such a show.<br/><br/>Black Mirror is very versatile in it's settings and moods, while I can see a lot of references to, or at least I'm often reminded of shows or movies I've seen. This makes it easy to dive deeply into each episode, even though they're so different.<br/><br/>For me, personally, it's mentally stressful to see bad things happen to children. Even if I know it's only a fictional plot. So, for example episodes White Christmas and Crocodile were hard to take for me. Just be warned. On the other hand, I really, really, really like the chilly winter mood. Especially the frosty, yet steaming from underneath setting in Crocodile.<br/><br/>Whatever. My 5 cents. I give it a 10. Every rating below let's say 7 comes from the wrong audience which proves the right audience right. This series feels so relevant to our current world and has actually made me want to shun social media and modern technology. Cultures and settings are interchangeable and there is never any indication of where it's shot or whether it's set in the future or modern day, which only adds to the other worldliness of the series. Charlie Brooker himself has said that the title is based on an idea that when we look into a black (switched off) computer screen it reflects a dark shadow back to us. This shadow form accurately reflects the darker recesses of the human mind as depicted by the show's protagonists. Episodes vary dramatically however this theme is always beautifully maintained throughout. The writing is so intelligent and thought-provoking to the point where the message stays with you long after viewing. Very few series make me feel fully immersed in the storytelling like this one does and I'm already itching for the next season. Intelligent writing, beautifully executed. Is it possible that a show can be every emotion ever felt by a human being all at once? Well, Black Mirror definitely proves so. One of the most impressive series of the recent times, it becomes with a strong mix of stories. The creators have obviously spent a lot of time curating these stories to make for thrilling seasons one after the other. <br/><br/>I am particularly happy and satisfied with the consistency of the episodes. I love how each one of them (and the Directors are to be credited for that, of course) can simply engulf you and make you a part of the story within just a few mins. At several occasions, I have found myself so connected to the characters. <br/><br/>The production value is also excellent. You do really start believing what you see because everything looks so convincing. I do hope that this series does not stop for a long long long time! Amazing TV series which amazingly depicts the the realistic part of how science and technology is taking over over life rapidly and what happens when technology is taken for granted. This TV gives a glimpse of near reality and how things can get so intense that technology can itself become a dark reality than something which makes our life easier.
Charlie Booker has created a real master piece. This show is like The Twilight Zone on steroids. After every episode I feel really shaken up. There have been very few shows or movies that have had this kind of effect on me in recent years. The anthology series is based on the premise that in the futuristic world where despite mind blowing high-tech stuff, humans still end up more miserable than they were before. It makes you question (you know similar to whether robots are good, aliens are friends?) whether we want that kind of "cool" or seemingly interesting techs around us.<br/><br/>If you can digest the above premise than you are in for a heck of a ride. The writing & cast is so brilliant, you get immersed in each episode almost as if living in that world. The series delivers episode after episode its dark thrilling tales that gets you engrossed completely.<br/><br/>I am not giving out any spoilers but would recommended highly for people who are a fan of "out of the box" concept stories... The first 3 seasons were amazing , not able to find the right word to explain it . and waiting very impatiently , I am now on 4th episode but still waiting for the past seasons effects . hv not able to find it yet , but I am such hopefull about it , because it is still one of my favourite series I read all the reviews and started to watch S1E1, The PM and the pig, all I can say this was stupid. However S1E2 was slightly better and then S1S3 - S4 all the episodes were amazing so stick with this or just start watching from S1E3. The depiction of everyday and backstage situations through the use of super advanced technology of the future. At it's heart "Black Mirror" is a scifi show using elements of reality and fiction to create believable worlds and characters. If an episode is not pushing the boundaries of ethics and morality: it is creating fictitious glimpses into near futures that are wholly entertaining.<br/><br/>The first 2 seasons are short and might put people off with it's Anglo centric storytelling. Seasons 1 & 2 appeal more to a British audience but if you stick it out until Season 3 the storytelling broadens to include a more predominant American presence to it's characters and storytelling.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the show is that conflicts within a character are often left unresolved by the end of an episode, leading people to review "Black Mirror" as a bleak or dark description of a fictitious future.<br/><br/>Definitively worth watching/buying on DVD. I'm so impressed with season 4 episode 1 I had to write a bout it. At what point do our desires become non-fiction. Wonderful. Netflix produced the third season of this previously BBC sci-fi thriller of stand-alone episodes that range from horror to mystery to romance yet all provide cautionary tales on how we use technology today. The third season has some harsh depictions of social media hate, societal ranking by online activity, and even technological effects on warfare. None of this episodes are cheerful and all of them end on a haunting note that will leave viewers second-guessing their online interactions and the nature of our reality. This season fell right in line with what I've enjoyed so far about the short series and I found no episode lacking in mind-bending social commentary and sci-fi entertainment.<br/><br/>The first episode "Nosedive" follows Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) as she tries to increase her ranking in a society that judges each social interaction with a five-star rating. As Lacie takes a road trip to her old friend/bully's wedding she encounters different rankings and finds that the world isn't open to those who haven't had positive interactions their whole lives. The scenario is a definite possibility as individuals achieve fame and money from Instagram likes and a person's career can be destroyed from a single Twitter rant.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com Black Mirror: San Junipero & Nosedive (United Kingdom, Charlie Brooker, 2016) – Technology hurts as much as it helps. Its knife cuts both ways. This Netflix television series of short stories reveals the sting of technology as well as the opportunities it provides.<br/><br/>San Junipero – The story begins in a 1980s dance club. It is a strange setting for a series based on technology. Yet appearances are deceptive. There is more going on than meets the eye. Two women meet at the club and one asks the other if there is anything she would like to do that she has never done. There are more possibilities than it seems.<br/><br/>Nosedive – Instant and random ratings of routine interactions determine social status, living quarters, jobs and so on. In this new world it is hard to climb and easy to fall. Does one pretend to be happy and successful in order to get better ratings, or does it pay to be authentic and honest? One young woman pins her hopes for a better life on a previous acquaintance who happens to be a rising star in this precarious world. However, this acquaintance was always mean to her. It is difficult to know who to trust. One false step or twist of fate may lead to a nosedive in life prospects.<br/><br/>The stories are timely, darkly humorous and imaginative. Technology is a fascinating subject. I was worried that this television series would not be as adequately funded as if it was a big screen film, but there did not seem to be much of a difference. While there is depth lacking in the dialogue and the acting is a little flimsy, the Black Mirror series and these stories are compelling. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. Three and a half of five stars. Black mirror episodes are like a Law and order episode, you can click on a episode without having to watch it in order, which is why I love it. S5 is quite the best yet!! These episodes that they are bring out is unexplored Territory, bringing a whole new game and meaning to everything it self. I've only just seen the first episode (National Anthem) and I am absolutely impressed!!! I've seen some negative reviews citing how the show is disturbing but that is quite literally the entire point of why I liked it. It would be like criticizing a roller coaster because it felt dangerous. Well, in my case, that would be a damn good reason why I'd LOVE a particular roller coaster.<br/><br/>I guess I have the ability to separate fictional strife (this show, roller coasters, scary movies) from real strife (which I don't like at all). <br/><br/>Aside from the story itself, I was impressed with the "realism" in portraying something that is in a slightly bizarro world version of ours. I guess I can imagine how Hollywood would screw this up with "over-the-topness". The British production values are at their best here. After finishing Utopia (another British series) started looking for a new TV-series like the good series-junkie I am... I came across this series. I've read the plot "anthology bla bla dark side of technology" I thought yeah why not, sounds interesting! Who have ever thought that such a funny plot can turn in serious drama ! Oh my god the scenario is so disturbing and funny with the PM to have to f*ck a pig live on national TV I didn't know if I needed to shut it down, laugh till the next morning or watch it like there is no tomorrow! Weird, original, giving food for thoughts and discussion. British people are innovating indeed! Thumbs up for the writer/writers I do not use to write reviews, but this series is gold and a must-watch for everyone who hasn't watched this yet. It's a mix of sci-fi, black comedy and drama. It might be a sci-fi, with the majority of the episodes being sci-fi(except one or two), but you gonna enjoy it regardless. Every episode is self-contained, so you can start from season 4 if you wish to but make yourself a favor and watch it lol.
I can name you many reasons to watch it, but one of my favorite reasons is that "disturbed" feeling that you get every time an episode ends! A show that transcends traditional boundaries and leaves the viewer hungry for more. It's definitely a show that you could analyze for hours. Incredibly complex, detailed, and one of the best series out there. Good episode, however when they described the pistol as an "automatic weapon" they lost credibility with me. I mean seriously. A quick Google search would have told you it was semi automatic. Yes there is a difference. Honestly the most boring series ever !!better to watch sausage Party movie !!!! Its so sad to see this is what our generation will see as "black film" it isn't. Dont be fooled. The concept is mediocre the stories are poorly executed. It's sad that they were able to fool so many people. Anthony mackie... smh Lol,i started watching this series by seeing of its high rating which i guess was my mistake I watched first episode and decided not to continue. Sadistic sadistic sadistic...... Would rate this a 0 if i could, it's boring, everything is excepted. pretty braindead series to me, Capitalism/technology bad. The only exception is the one with the pig which has nothing to it beyond being uncomfortable. Totally boring
season 1 episode 1 is ok but e2 and 3 is boring Series is overrated, no logic and just senseless stories. Waste of time. I only made it a few episodes into the 1st season. It was just weird. Not worth wasting my time watching any more. Didn't see much entertainment value in this. I know many people might find it obnoxious but with all these things in their minds, they did NOT play it fair with the play. I mean there are more than 20 times where you would say it could've been better. But still, you can blame the writer and director for not doing the justice. The presentation is though quite great. In my opinion you should watch it at least once though.<br/><br/>Moral of the review?<br/><br/>You should watch it. My opinion can be yours but not always. It was a great peice about social media. Then I started over and watched the one involving beastiality just completely unnecessary. I don't understand why so high rates? Nothing special about that TV show, just about new technologies that have influence on people, so what? 5 stars only because of actors play. It's a must watch for any movie lover who looks for creativity and something new. Story of the show is filled with new concepts and glimpse of future. You can't resist to praise maker's creative approach. It's highly entertaining at the same point push you to think for some questions you have ignored so far A superb, sharp series of vignettes. Very prescient.<br/><br/>The last series was a little disappointing and seemed to be less sharp than previous seasons. Nevertheless, well worth the watch. I really enjoyed it ( saw it 3 times in two days)! I am one of the biggest Daniel Lapaine fans and I say that this is his best movie yet. This is one of the most amazing shows I've ever seen. Looking forward to next season It's beyond safe to make this statement: Nearly every human being on this planet owns a personal mobile device; a black mirror. We're fixated...ensnared like a fictional cobra's dizzy-eyed hypnotism. Interesting factoid: Earth's atmosphere is comprised of Nitrogen and Oxygen. But, did you know that when organisms pass away, the bodies decompose into the fertile, rich land-creating nitrogen in the soil and even in the vast, cerulean blue that makes up 75% of our globe. Plants are able to utilize this process and power life itself. Humans, animals-we learn to crawl, talk, walk, run, sprint, walk again, slowly strafe, slow our breathing-then rest our eyes after seeing and experiencing a good life; a personal history that could fill countless novels.<br/><br/>As we come and go, the seemingly countless black mirrors scattered across every inch of our planet continue on. Newer, faster versions are created every year-unlocking a limitless amount of information, automation-even redefining what convenience and "one sec... here you go" means. Are we headed towards a Skynet takeover? Well, yes, in part. Only a small part. It's much more than an artificial paradigm shift. It's about the journey towards arriving there-and humanity is the centerpiece; the protagonists.<br/><br/>Charlie Brooker has created and curated a not-too-distant glimpse at where technology could one day, realistically, be. We all hold the all-knowing Doc Brown and young, exuberant, multi-faceted Marty McFly in dear regard, but that vision was even was undersold by a few miles. The future will be brighter, far more advanced, far more spectacular-with a Blade Runner wildcard factor: If we continue to progress towards AI dependency, it'll be our downfall.<br/><br/>Is it laziness? Sure, I like using the remote, too. Is it scientific exploration? Thank you, Mr. Kubrick. Is it a lift hill on a futuristic roller coaster-once reaching the apex-will come rocketing down towards the ground at breakneck speed? Stay tuned you theme park junkies you.<br/><br/>In the fourth season of Black Mirror, a few, albeit, "disparate episodes" exist that delve further into the soul and mind than other entries. I like to think of Charlie's Brooker's structure as a flawless symphony. You have bridge compositions that ease the mind into a trance, before the big numbers etch their way into our hearts-slightly altering how we process the world around us; our life. A spiritual cleanse. The beauty and power of art.<br/><br/>The National Anthem plays with the sickness social media has plagued across each one of our devices. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook all hold the power-with the strength in numbers-to move mountains, figuratively-or perhaps, literally? What seems like an internal country crisis (dear Princess Savannah being captured and ransomed), morphs into a global, social phenomenon. This notoriety causes one of the highest, most prominent figures in the world-and the UK-to (yes, let's say it together) "give it to a swine from behind." Brilliant, humorous, but such depth in the message.<br/><br/>The Entire History of You is a dangerous, raw exploration into each moment of our lives being digitally preserved and available 24/7 for near-instantaneous playback. A super-powered DirecTV Genie with an infinite SSD. Would 911 have been prevented if security and world police agencies could see every single moment in our lives before boarding any plane? Would crime as a whole be lowered? Or-even deeper down the rabbit hole we go: The truth is twisted behind your back, until one day you subtly take notice to nuances that seem off with a significant other, close family member-whomever. You obsess-like playing a dark-caped detective. Replaying through things with "this person" until your suspicions drive you mad. Every time you approach this person, they make you feel like you're unjustifiably accusing them, so you briefly give up. But you can't let it go. Something is there, scratching the inside of your mind. Then one day you unearth the evidence and reveal the lie. You weren't going crazy. This person made you feel awful for accusing them, but, in fact-you were right the entire time. I don't know about you guys but this makes me shake with fear.<br/><br/>Be Right Back toys with the stretched, dry tear-ducted-emotion of losing someone insanely close to you. IF...technology allowed for a recreation of this loved one-based on their "social posting personality" and interactions via email, would this appease us-or hold our natural grieving process in a wretched circle of hell. We'll never truly forget our parents or god-forbid a spouse passing too early, but we do have to move on to an extent. If not, we'll ironically trap ourselves in a hell matrix.<br/><br/>USS Callister reminds us that bullying is bad, and creates a path towards suicide-or possibly worse, a stealthy, grotesque psychopath. Technology as a whole is utilized best here, in my humble opinion. Not only is this a standout episode to get all your nerdy fanboy friends into, but this disparate installment plays with Star Trek themes without ripping out Star Trek itself. It's far too smart for that move. The notion of transforming a life of fandom to that of a toxic villain is powerful and all too true example in a world of comic book film adaptions. Don't forget: Evil, maniacal men can wear the "good guy's uniform" in a gold statue worthy performance.<br/><br/>Hang the DJ is all about the advancement of technical algorithms and how this now contributes toward two people meeting, falling in love, and defying traditional norms and expectations. We've all had flings that we knew from the beginning would someday fall apart. For Frank and Amy, they knew from the get-go that it was each other or nothing; no living. A pure romantic entanglement, that for one hour defies the Black Mirror DNA. It's a stroke of genius. A flair for the dramatic; a love story that "hits home" to each one of our lives. For me, Hang the DJ rounded the bases multiple times. A dating app isn't just an app. It's a simulation within itself where 99.8% of our digital replications choose one another nearly every time. Thus, when the real world us meet, the app's digitized versions of ourselves have done their job; have made the sacrifice so the real could be together. This episode is designed around one arching theme: To cheer for true love. No cheesy popcorn here. I mean it. We may have ever-changing, ever-expanding technology, but that doesn't change the chemistry and power of the deepest human connection: love. Or does it?<br/><br/>If you find yourself not agreeing with my assessments and positioning, then you've missed the point entirely. This is a love letter to a beautiful schematic that holds its own against all other comers. We're stuck within a sack of non-original creativity-for the most part-so when unique, original creative ideas come to fruition, it's truly art, and why we write, play music, paint, dance-or do what we do. I like a lot of what I've seen in Black Mirror. But there are two episodes that are only there to try to put "gays" in a normal light. I just shut those shows down. One is the 5th season episode - "Striking Vipers". This show was pretty interesting.. Shows how humanity acts in certain (bizarre) situations. Fascinating..... It helps you to realise truth of our society I think Black Mirror is the case that's proves not all science fiction-related series are nerd. It undermines all the doubts and speculations about the future by answering it on the show. Masterpiece 10/10 Shhh.. don't tell everyone about this, many people don't know!<br/><br/>Nothing else on tv has ever stuck in my mind..wow..so good and dark..frighteningly true.<br/><br/>I can't find the one where the power goes off in the uk..that one was particularly disturbing.<br/><br/>A warning? A glimpse? Certainly awesome drama, extremely well acted by people you never heard of and the stories are off the chart...brilliant!! Note: I have watched through Season 5, and I have no intention of watching further.<br/><br/>Black Mirror messes with your mind. There is no overarching plot because each episode is it's own story. Each episode focuses on a theoretical situation, usually centered around a current or theoretical piece of technology, and all of them portrayed very realistically. It's easy to think of the show's conflicts as immediately rising threats in the real world, with major emphasis on the word "threat." Each episode makes the technology's benefits very clear, giving more credit to its believability, before explaining how it could be used for evil purposes.<br/><br/>Season 1 & 2 - Easily the best seasons. The stories are so harrowing that I couldn't force myself to watch more than 1 episode in a row. Even though I watched these seasons years ago, I still occasionally find myself pondering their implications. There are a couple of rare duds, but most of the episodes are fantastic. These seasons are so good that I wouldn't blame you if you don't watch the rest of the series. 8/10<br/><br/>Seasons 3 & 4 - The original writers probably dropped the series after season 2 because they ran out of material. When Netflix picks it back up, I think it's more accurate to call this a new and similar series rather than a continuation of the original. The seasons have many more episodes, and also many more duds. Granted, even the duds still have thought-provoking concepts, but every 5-15 minutes of substance is dragged out into a 60 minute episode. The series would have been much better if each episode simply goes on as long as necessary to convey the point rather than dragging on to fill a full hour. Plus they are generally "ruined" by relatively happy endings, and the removal of the hopelessness means the formerly gut-wrenching problems don't pack the same punch and they don't stick with the viewer for nearly as long. The result is a show that's much easier to binge (which is Netflix's goal) at the expense of good storytelling. 5/10<br/><br/>Season 5 - Fewer episodes means the writers get to throw out the dud ideas. The episodes didn't drag like the duds of seasons 3 & 4, so it's a step in the right direction. Though it does still lack the punch and lasting impression of seasons 1 & 2. I don't think Netflix is ever likely to return to the roots of a show that's difficult to watch, so this is probably the best we're going to get from now on. 6/10 Disturbing, real, awesome and overwhelming. This series is one of the best written Netflix shows. However, it lost its essence at the end. So clever compact movies! Never bored! You never know what is gonna be next! Just a couple of episodes that didn't quite reach the target for me... Great show , excellent ideas and directed to perfection , most of the episode were very interesting , the cover tricked me , i thought it's something else at all . pure genius ideas for future time The best thing in black mirror is the end of each story.
It shocked me every time but I love it .. I fell it like black comedy This show is simply great.<br/><br/>Every episode has a new interesting story to offer and yes, there are reocurring themes or similar ideas, but in my mind that's the point of the show in a way.<br/><br/>It's always thrilling to figure out what the plot-twist is going to be and an enjoyable visual journey even if the episode may not be quite my taste. This show could win the award for a Binge-Worthy Watch statue! Its amazing and even Season 5 was good. It's different from the previous seasons but it's still really good. You just have to have an open mind and not expect everything to continue to be the same. It took until season 5 primer for me to start driving myself into this proclaimed series. I got to say it did not disappoint, NOT at all. Everything is just perfect; the actors selection, the acting, the scripts, the visual, the soundtracks and best of all, the story lines. So many twists, sometime predictable but still surprising to an extent. Every single episode is thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Some people will like some episodes more than the others, depending on how much they relate to it. If you have been thinking so much about the subject of death, you will love "San Junipero" (literally the only episode with an actual happy ending). If your interest lies within the realm of detective/ crime genre, you will adore "Playtest" and "Hated in the Nation". "Fifteen Million Merits" is all about the entertainment industry and "Nosedive" will get you choked-up a little if you are an Instagram-freak.<br/><br/>For me, this is one of the best things ever came out in the decade. Really the best series ever. Each episode just blows your mind. All of the episodes very well define future technologies This review is for the first 3 seasons only. I'm going to disregard the 4th and 5th seasons as if they've never existed.<br/><br/> How could you describe Black Mirror? Episodes like 'Fifteen Million Merits', 'The Entire History of You', 'White Christmas', and my 2 personal favourites 'Shut Up and Dance' and 'White Bear' are television masterpieces.<br/><br/>I really want to call this series a comedy, but not a comedy in a 'ha-ha' way, it's hard to describe what I mean. Every episode in this series will leave you enthralled and completely mind blown at what you have just seen (in a good way). Each episode is it's own mini story and all of them seeks to answer a prevailing problem in our society in a way that will leave you with shivers at the end of it. This is, in the end, a true modern take on the twilight zone and anybody out there, need to take the time out of their day to watch this. Probably the best Web series you'll ever see greatest of all time The problem with Netflix is the sometimes unnecessary binge in wanting a resolution then and there. The great thing about Black Mirror are the diverse ideas presented each episode that really get you thinking, invested in the characters and are resolved. What's really interesting are some of the abstract ideas which are hard to swallow but make us believe because of its generally character driven script making it very relatable! Rarely do series get me as excited as Black Mirror did and does, can't wait for a new season. I thought some episodes were better than others but all worth watching, and the better ones are just in a whole different league to just about everything that's come on tv/Netflix this past decade. Incredibly mind provoking, deep, dark, great acting and brilliant scripts. I could go on and on but basically I think people should just watch and see for themselves. I can't imagine a show that's more representative of a diverse world that we live in, it truly caught my eye. I have no doubt this is the best show in the world. 100%<br/><br/>Some are better than others. But this does not get enough credit If there were only 5 out of 20 odd good shows - this series still deserves top marks - however almost all are great to 10/10. A few miss the mark. Series/season 5 clearly changed direction due to it going on Netflix and put a lot of more of the stories in the US (for that audience) over the UK and also created one in modern day story about someone in this world we live in . Bandersnatch also deviates from the future dystopia model which has no future tech involved bar the irony that we are watching a period piece through a future tech model and choosing his actions. So now Black Mirror will just do stories about almost anything, and what is done is mostly great. Do not be put of by low ratings. many people hate some episodes, but NO ONE hates them all, most love a few at the least. This show blew my mind on every episode. It really focuses on hitting your subconscious and make you cringe on every episode. The technology used on the show is just spectacular and make you wonder if we will get to see that in the near future.
I just have to say it, season 5 episode 3 was a f....g Nickelodeon show. Please don't do that again, ever!. If you are going to do another season please do it as dark and cringe watching as you can. Thanks Charlie Brooker is featuring speculative fiction and dark which examine our society. It is soo dark and gloomy show.<br/><br/>Like it though Not a lot of episodes but they are very good. each episodes changes the way you think with the different concepts. seasons 1-4 have their ups and downs , mostly ups. bandersnatch was not well planned out, boring. season 5 is interesting but has a different feel, not as interesting and empty plots. This is one of the best shows I have watched. It concerns the dark side of technology and how it can impact our modern lives (often quite negatively). Ot has great plot, character develpment and makes you question and think about hard topics.<br/><br/>However, the most recent season has become very light hearted and not dark and as it used to be. Got worse like GOT. Please do not make this show something it's not. I think the best episode of season 5. Episode 1 and 3 are worst episodes of entire serie. Twists and turns that keep it interesting. Along the lines of the original Twightlight Zone, or Night Gallery.
People seem to think that every episode has to be dark, or have some sort of tragic ending. That would create boredom, because the end would be predictable.
The thing I like best about this series is every episode is completely different, and never what I expect. That doesn't mean the viewer is surprised by some twist at every moment. Some episodes are bleak, scary, fun, horrific, odd, etc... but they all make you think.
While some episodes are better then others, I can't think of any that I didn't enjoy.
My only criticism is there aren't enough episodes in each season!!! Great series to watch, that reminds Twilight zone or similar. In my opinion, it has in its favor the surprise factor and that mystery that we like so much. But in each season there is a chapter more lazy than others, they should be a little shorter in duration and more electrifying, mysterious and powerful stories. High technology makes people understand that the body is only a body after all, and your inner self is the real you. Way too many 10/10 episodes for this not to get a 10.
Each and everyone a moral dilemma, most a frightening look at how fast tech is growing and how it could ruin life as we know it.
Look at us just 10 years ago, and look at this very message about a t.v. show on a streaming site called Netflix. Where are we going to be as 2030 rolls in.<br/><br/>Black Mirror tounge very much stuck in cheek . And to top it off its written by one of the funniest dry dark comedy guys in Britain Charlie Brooker. This tv series is always short, especially this season, but it was worth watching as usual. I didn't want to give it 10 just 9 but the reason so is because of IMDB. They made this short clip saying, "Did Black Mirror over deliver?". Ugh, how about over crying or over demanding. Of course, the content of the video might not be as the title but still, it wasn't fair to the tv-series. Like I said ignore the first episode, go back to it after you watch the series. Amazing series deep thought and intellect behind it. Some episodes might lack to some, others might pull you right into it. But definitely something worth spending time on. Really good series that makes us think outside the box. Absolutely brilliant. Fabulous and unlike anything else ever .
Each episode its own little movie.
9 due to the odd episode not being a 10 thats all.<br/><br/>Took me years before I watched as i couldn't get to grips with Charlie Brooker writting fiction and not comedy ( if you aint seen him stand up or on tv i recommend it ) watched every episode in a binge .<br/><br/>Great stuff Black Mirror has undeniably gained considerable popularity in the last 2 years, benefitting from Netflix injecting a healthy dose of money and production power into a previously understated British gem. The power of the show is down to the consistent quality of stories, but this has begun to devolve slightly with the arrival of the American audience. There is no doubt more quality stories may be on the way, but there is certainly a fear that executive decisions may end up harming this television treasure.<br/><br/>The best of the show is undeniably in the first 2 seasons (when Charlie Brooker was at the helm); this was when Black Mirror wholeheartedly embraced the bleakness of its stories, each one a tormented glance at a future better off avoiding. A personal favourite, "The Entire History of You" is a prime example - unrelenting, thought provoking and disturbingly real. Part of the charm is also the continuous employment of lesser-known British actors, many of whom have gone onto many bigger things following having shown their qualities (such as Domhnall Gleeson and Daniel Kaluuya).<br/><br/>Since Netflix obtained the rights to the show, some of this quality has lapsed from time to time: misfire episodes were more common in seasons 3 and 4, alongside a sincere lack of despair usually portrayed in the show. No doubt there were still some strong showings ("Shut Up and Dance" is another good episode), but these were diluted by the presence of tame episodes like "San Junipero" and "Metalhead". This also correlated with the use of more and more famous actors (such as Dallas Bryce Howard and Jimmi Simpson), which to me signifies a weaker story propped up by bigger names.<br/><br/>As eager as I am for the new season to be released, there is certainly an air of apprehension: seeing Anthony Mackie and Miley Cyrus in the trailers screams overcompensation, alongside the clear budget raise each episode is displaying already. We can only hope that the episodes this coming season have not been sterilised for the mass market, and still hold the gravity that made this show great. This has got to be the best anthology type show I have ever seen. I am astonished by how often an episode leaves me breathless. This show is at the apex of the current batch of brilliant TV shows. It is a commentary on contemporary society, technology, love, loss, remembrance, apathy, sympathy, pathos, and metaphysics. It is sometimes satirical, sometimes sad, and sometimes biting and sardonic. It is witty, beautifully written, directed and cast. Wish it could go on forever. One of the best scifi shows on TV, and only 3 episodes? Come on!
On the other hand, I prefer quality over quantity.
PS: Peeles Twilight Zone sucks, BTW. Black mirror is very amusing series to watch but after some time it gets really boring Every episode of the show is like a separate movie, and every episode I watched so far is at least very good. I almost watched 90% of the show and till now "White Bear" is my favourite with no doubts. I would strongly recommend it. I would 100% recommend Black Mirror! This show is never the same. I love how each episode is diffrent. I have watchers them all at least twice and everytime I watch them they seem different! Love this show!!! The idea of a show with a stories that don't interconnect and each episode has different casts always intrigued me. It's a gamble because you can get an episode that's the equivalent to 'the room' or one equivalent to 'the godfather'. Black mirror is what I expected, some episodes are fantastic and others are meh, similar to the twilight zone. But it's commentary on modern technology really is fascinating so you'll always get at least one good moment from an episode What else can I say? Sat and watched the 3rd and 4th series (it went from 4 backwards for some reason) in one go! Absolutely mesmerized!! This Tv-Series is just good. Plots are pretty obvious and old, but this fact does not make it harder to enjoy them. I watched only 1 season and a half of 2, and it is important to understand ,that they are not against technologies. It shows our presence and human's disadvantages. The best example of it is episode with guy, who has all his life recorded in his brain. Technologies make it easier to see our problems. As the title states there is probably an episode for everyone when it comes to black mirror. It's an anthology so you can watch each episode out of order, however make sure you watch 'black museum' last if you decide to opt for picking and choosing the episodes you like. The story lines are often clever and thought provoking and often come with a twist that you wouldn't have guessed prior to finishing the episode which is rare to find in modern TV.
I'm my opinion some of the best episodes include:
San Junipero (a fun story set in the 80s)
White bear (a story to get you thinking)
Shut up and dance (the dangers of computer hacking)
National anthem (probably the most famous episode involving the PM and a pig)
Hang the DJ (a romance story in which an app tells you how long you will be with a romantic partner) Every episode has a different story to tell which is why I love it because I can pause and continue whenever I feel like. And every episode addresses different social issues from day to day life in a carefully thought symbolic maze. You can easily understand some episodes while with other episodes one needs some pondering over. With me it was mostly that plus the shock and hundreds of questions popping up!! Some episodes have managed to creep me out for days together. :D I really struggled rating this show. I believe that the writers, producers and actors doa great job. I like the show. But for who loves dark and twisted. Also I'm a pieces and we get deep. I binged watched this one day. I had to stop watching because I was depressed. I think because I could see some of these sick and twisted things happening with humanity making decisions. However I think that's the point. Very well done. Absolutely on of the best series i've ever watched. One word: BRILLIANT!
Looking forward to seeing more episodes of Black Mirror! Wish I could live enough to see the days when all black mirror ideas come true.
