Watchmen at its heart as a graphic novel and now a TV show isn't about deconstructing the myth of the superhero. It's about us. It's a very dark, realistic take on our country and our people with superheroes as the cherry on top.<br/><br/>This show demonstrates that beautifully. While the comic was about the fear and anxiety of the 80's, this show is about today. The writing is clever. The subtle ways the writers managed to continue from where the comic left off (just a few decades later) is very well done. The way the show mocks many of the folks here who are complaining about the show being "too political" (as if the graphic novel wasn't) by having their beloved Rorschach be the face of a white supremacist movement is sharp. If you saw him as the hero the first time around, Moore's comic and its themes went right over your head. I love how this show points that out.<br/><br/>Regina King is a force to be reckoned with. This show is exactly what a true fan would want and anyone who thinks otherwise needs to revisit the source material. The series brilliantly creates a world similar to ours but with a unique parallel history in which events happened but with different starts or ends. In modern times, the cops takes white supremacists way more seriously than they do in our reality, which is why people are screaming about "wokeness." But it's far more complicated than that, because its masked cops ignore civil rights and can be fairly lawless, which - guess what?! - is not what we social justice types are after.<br/><br/>The complex morality is echoed in the complex plotting, with a bunch of dark characters in a very strange, dark, violent world and a story arc chockfull of mysteries.<br/><br/>The cast is first rate, most notably Jeremy Irons as a peculiar aristocrat and the phenomenal Regina King as the ultimate ass-kicker.<br/><br/>As for its relation to the graphic novel and movie, I read/watched them but it was years ago and honestly I don't remember much of anything about either one except they were both quite good. I may like this series better than either so far (based on the first 5 episodes), but I couldn't even hazard an opinion on the debate as to whether it is to the source material. As an entity of its own though, it is absolutely brilliant, and I highly recommend it. The majority of the comments here came after one episode. One. Episode. I'm now 4 episodes deep and this story is great. It is timely. It is scary. It's exciting.<br/><br/>Episode 4 starts with a message, "If you don't like the story, write your own."<br/><br/>That is absolutely right.<br/><br/>I have never reviewed a show after four episodes but I traveled to IMDB and saw the rating and felt obligated. This show has acting, cinematography, sountrack, you name it.<br/><br/>It is doing what a good series should and building the story. This show is great. Watch it. I have no issue with the underlying story and using white supremacists as the villains. What is problematic is taking the Watchman characters and just changing them to your whims to create a story. So Jon who had shed his humanity just does a complete 180 and comes back to Earth to pick up a random girl in a bar. Said girl then decides to start a relationship with this robotic individual with no personality. Ozymandias comes off as goofy comic relief just because it was needed in the story, not because it was his established character. And we really are to believe some cleaning women was able to determine that Ozy had sperm hidden in his office, find out his password, impregnate herself, and escape Karnak, which just happens to be in Antarctica? Potential was there to be better. Ignore every review that places politics front and center. The show is utterly nihilistic about the politics. The Seventh Kavalry is obviously evil, but everyone seems to entirely miss the fact that the two woke, authoritarian, socialist, utopian statists are every bit as evil, thinking all that's stopping them from saving the world is the accumulation of power.<br/><br/>That said, the show itself is at times great and terrible. There are episodes so corny and ridiculous that they're nearly unwatchable and then episodes that are totally stunning. The show is extremely ambitious so not always hitting the mark is to be expected.<br/><br/>It is absolutely worth watching, but not nearly as good as people are pretending, and certainly not as flag-wavingly woke as they're thinking. Most of the reviews place an emphasis on politics, and rightly so, this is a VERY political show. Disappointingly political, because the social commentary is handled with all the finesse, subtlety, and skill of a toddler killing ants with a sledgehammer. If you do not care about left-wingers, and right-wingers, and all of that trash, the show just on the merits is not that good, and I feel like this five star review is being rather generous. I would ignore any 10 star or 1 star review however because both are equally inaccurate and could not have been made in good faith. There is nothing about this show that could make it reasonably deserve any better than a 7, and likewise anything under a 3 is also unjustifiable.<br/><br/>The real scoop: The show is a very weak depiction of Watchmen, which you may enjoy more if you subscribe to the particular political message the writers pushed in a very hamfisted way, can ignore the show's overall low quality because it caters to you in that way, and are unfamiliar with the source material the show is based on. The biggest issue with this aspect is that the message the writers picked is a very odd choice to match up with Watchmen, because it is incongruous with the source material. One of the amazing things about the ye-olde Watchmen graphic novel is it was anti-state when most comics were ultra patriotic and pro-state, and smashed the "Moral Absolutism" present in most comic books by depicting most of the characters as morally gray rather than white hats and black hats. This show embraces the exact opposite stance, and does it in the most milquetoast way possible: By assigning the villain roles exclusively to caricatures of people with whom the writers politically disagree, and assigning the hero roles exclusively to people with whom the writers agree politically.<br/><br/>The thing the original did so well was it sold a message to the audience that was likely different from what the audience believed, and did it in a way that could convince them that the message was correct without beating them over the head with it. It made people think about big things. This show on the other hand only has a message to stroke the egos of the target audience who already agrees with it, and rather than making any attempt to show the merits of these stances through clever writing, they just openly disparage everyone who disagrees, which is fine with their target audience but does absolutely nothing to convince anyone of their stance. Something the original did so well.<br/><br/>Moving on past politics, the show itself even with the obnoxious political overtures stripped out is not that great. The plot is extremely dissonant. Some of the subject matter is extremely dark, and some is just ridiculously silly, and it comes in no particular order. The silliness of some parts of the show keeps the more serious elements from feeling serious, because you never know when the supposedly deep moral moments will be interspersed with raining squid. The writing is very much like the Star Wars Prequels, in that it can range from very good to very bad in the span of about 30 seconds, and like those films the show is generally better when nobody is talking.<br/><br/>Visuals: The effects are I'd say somewhere between a CW superhero show and a 15+ year old A-list film. That is to say, usually not outright terrible but definitely not amazing. It's somewhat surprising that this is an HBO original show because the visual effects are a huge downgrade from other HBO shows like Game of Thrones. The cinematography is nothing to write home about, it gets the point across. In this regard the show grinds along at a constant sub-par level that is endurable, but not enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overall, the show is painfully sub-par for an HBO show just on the merits, and has little to no value as a social commentary because it picks the safest possible stance for its target audience, and rams it down your throat in the laziest and least subtle possible way. How do you review a show after one episode? Two or even three? Let the show develop. The fan boys are crying for all the wrong reasons. This is a very good sequel to an amazing graphic novel with the politics updated to our times. Don't let the whiny reviews stop you from watching a great series and I read the comic. Damon Lindelof did a great job with this series. I swear people are always looking for something to be offended by. The characters are good and the storyline is good. Watch the show for yourself and stop reading reviews from people who are easily triggered. There was nothing cliche about Watchmen. Trolls really need to be prevented from making reviews because their reviews all sound the same. This show would sound exciting and interesting, but I still found it very boring. What made the movie interesting was that it took place in a believable world where people became masked vigilantes and some of it could be relatable. The tv series on the other hand is a mix between Science-Fiction / Fantasy with unlikable characters that we're forced to watch go through this very unbelievable world. I preferred the movie over this . Watchmen series tackled a big topics as Black vs. Whites , accepting who you are on the outside ,and family trees ;all through the eyes of African American and maybe that's one reason I couldn't get into this show. The director also must of drew inspiration from Legion because things keep getting odder and odder as the series went on with with a colorful atmosphere unlike the dark , depressing world of the movie. As I'm writing this I realized that the bit I liked about the series kept shrinking and now I have to give it a lower score than what I originally did. I do not understand the negative comments. The first episode was truly amazing and I cannot wait for the next one. Very intriguing world, great cinematography, interesting characters. What more can you want? Had to write this review considering all the hate. Great pilot, one of the best ones I've seen in a long time. Beautifully shot, great acting, intense, relevant and highly entertaining. If you have any taste for thought provoking movies, books or shows, you'll love it. For the folks out there calling this show "Woke" you actually might be a racist. This show is not "Woke"... Charlies Angels was Woke. Dark Fate was Woke... Watchmen is just great storytelling with a diverse cast and poignant, rarely discussed historical topics.<br/><br/>Seriously, did anyone at any point during high school and college ever once bring up Tulsa 1921? No? Yea me neither.<br/><br/>This show isn't preaching at us and I really appreciate. For the first time in what feels like an eternity there is a strong female lead who is believable and doesn't need to tell us she's a strong female lead. She isn't some stupid Fing supermodel who looks cute holding a gun trying to make us believe her 105lb a$$ can beat up a grown man. THAT folks is woke horsesh**.<br/><br/>I haven't seen this many African American actors on one show/film this mainstream since Black Panther. I love it.<br/><br/>Regina King is truly fantastic and I'm so happy shes the face of something so mainstream.<br/><br/>I'm only a few episodes in but im hooked... all I ask is please Damon Lindelof... don't "Lost" us here. This version of Watchmen looks really cheap, not even close to Snyder's great adaptation. Bad casting, bad scenario, ridiculous dialogues and of course this ugly dr. Manhattan(handsome Squidward). It's about 4 episodes into the show so far, I assume out of 10, and so far it doesn't seem to be about anything.<br/><br/>It still seems to be world-building and doing call-backs to remind you it's a sequel to the comic series, rather than having a plot of its own.<br/><br/>It appears to be hinting that there will be a story eventually, but that's it. If you keep watching, eventually a story will happen.<br/><br/>Long story short, this show thinks it's way better than it actually is. You could have just set this up as its own fictional universe; you'd have the same result. It's not very interesting and the Adrian Veight character is absurd.<br/><br/>Three stars only because Don Johnson surprised me with the intensity of his performance, and because the art direction and music are superb. The rest of it stinks. No, I am not 'triggered'. And no I am not a Trumpster or Republican. I am a person who was looking forward to watch a series based on the comics or movies, and got a show with a political agenda. I read, watch and listen to too much political news as it is... then there is social media... when I want to watch television I want to watch a show with no agenda, no politics. I am sick of politics. The show is not offensive; it's plain annoying. This has nothing to do with the original Watchmen. Full of cringe, not even a single likeable character, totally no interesting storylines. As some one not from the USA, I am really surprised that the racial card is played in every single show nowadays. White people are bad, we got this. Can you please stop already? I could not wait to see this show. Watchmen fan from way back, I don't know what I was expecting. But this was not it. I will most likely not watch a second episode. Not sure on the target audience for this show, but I am not in it. Another misfire for HBO. I wanted to wait until this had been out a while before I rated it. I kept hoping it would get better. It may be inspired by the source material, but it is a long way from being what most fans expected.<br/><br/>It is exactly what many of the other reviews say it is. A social justice propaganda show. How woke are you? The series is a disaster. It fails to evoke the same excitement that came from Snyder's 2009 masterpiece. The cast are okay but the script is a mess. Nothing inspiring comes from watching this film as it fails in the plot direction from the poorly scribbled script. Dr Manhattan is a big mess and seems to be a hoax when compared with the one from Snyder's film. Very unlike HBO series,... childish to be exact... Way too politically charged and terrible storyline. This guy must have the biggest stash of blackmail material on just about every power player in Hollywood !!
A truly terrible writer, who has already ruined any "Alien" universe film for me, and is now let loose on Watchmen.
Except this ain't Watchmen. They share the name, and that's it.
Someone make him stop !! First off, IGNORE the very angry trolls . Within 5 seconds of watching this, i knew it would anger them, and for obvious reasons The show doesnt is unapologetic in the way it puts forward issues . Its a great watch, well made, riveting and true to the tone of Alan Moore's work. Very recommended This show makes zero sense in the aspect of Watchmen. It is all over the place and of course uses HBO liberal references at every possible moment. Bland atmosphere, confused first half, tacky almost shoddy out-fits.<br/><br/>Poor dialogue made worse by top name actors, managing the poor script, leaving you wondering whether they also found it painful as well !<br/><br/>With all the great shows out there, Watchmen ( which was hardly a story that made much of an impact originally anyway ), presented in an alternative reality, where they still try to sell you the black / white issue ( I guess alternative reality wasn't alternative enough ) and leave you waiting for the usual politically correct 'social rendering'.<br/><br/>What a shame. I wish I could raise more praise. Actually no I don't.<br/><br/>Meh......... :o) ( sideways Watchman ) How about you stay true to the source material and just do that. Don't take someone else's story and use the name to make your story a success. And in the process make people, that have never read the actual watchmen, believe that your story is true. When it could not be further from the truth. This is pretty much the most divisive propaganda on TV right now which is saying a lot. I'm latino and thought it was so off putting. Basically the show is all about white people being evil subhumans. The purpose of this show is about one thing and one thing only which is to create resentments in minorities and white guilt in whites. These people will little create racism out of this air. Very irresponsible filmmaking to say the least. I will not be watching any more of this trash. Absolutely diabolical, Watchmen was an incredible and intelligent graphic novel. This has nothing to do with the comic other than references to the material. Think about how clever the story arc was and the decisions made by the key characters in the novel. Why not make a 12 episode series based on the novel like the animated comic series as this falls incredibly short of the mark! Good guys? Bad guys? Who cares! By far, the WORST adaptation of anything that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>*********SPOILERS EVERYWHERE********<br/><br/>For those of you who loved Alan Moore's Watchmen; don't hold your breath. This show has virtually NOTHING to do with Moore's brilliant Watchmen, or the decent 2009 movie. It's a stupid-fied, politically correct-ified, mishmash train wreck of a series.<br/><br/>Here's an example to clarify. Suppose you see a new series, "Superboy". You like Superboy. You're excited. You watch the first episode, but it shows nothing but the daily life of Smallville's baker. For one second during the show, you see a tiny blue dot flying across the sky, presumably Superboy. One of the cakes the baker bakes, has an icing picture of Superboy on it. The show continues in this fashion. THIS is what Damon Lindelof, creator of this worthless, mean spirited mess, thought would be a superior continuation; instead of simply expanding on what Moore created.<br/><br/>I would guess that Lindelof got the rights to Watchmen cheap, and crassly used the title to attract viewers, when the title of the series is mostly a lie. Again, this series has virtually NOTHING to do with Moore's Watchmen, though it used a few of Moore's characters badly in mostly small capacities.<br/><br/>Instead, it features the police prominently (absolutely the DEAD OPPOSITE, of anything Alan Moore would have done), as the "good guys", who have these astounding powers:<br/><br/>1. A search warrant isn't needed, if you have a "feeling".<br/><br/>2. You do not need "probably cause" if you have a "feeling".<br/><br/>3. No prissy "Miranda rights".<br/><br/>4. With a suspect who has done NOTHING, it's OK to grab them, throw them in the trunk of your car and haul them into the police station; as long as you have a "feeling", of course! No pansy handcuffs, and a comfy back seat!<br/><br/>5. It's OK to deny the suspect a lawyer, even when asked for.<br/><br/>6. It's OK to make an agreement with the suspect, and then break it later, never having intended to honor it, because they're (by the officer's thinking), worthless.<br/><br/>7. You take the results of a high tech lie detector (polygraph), at face value (if it matches the officer's thinking, of course), and use it to justify abuse and torture of the suspect. (In the real world, polygraph results at NOT allowed as evidence in court. The reason for this, is at their absolute best under perfect conditions, with a highly skilled technician (rare), they are still wrong 1/3rd of the time. A high tech polygraph, would still have a high failure rate.)<br/><br/>8. It's OK to brutally beat a suspect, who has done NOTHING, to within an inch of his life, to get information, because you have a "feeling". But it's OK, because it's out of sight of the other officers.<br/><br/>9. OH, and all police officers wear masks, presumably so that you can't press charges against them for the brutal beatings and abuse. (Well, not the explanation in the series, but, actually, more logical.)<br/><br/>Unbelievable.<br/><br/>Regina King, the primary actress, is absolutely terrible. Has she ever has a single acting lesson in her life? Because this stupid, worthless series is SO black/white focused, I will mention that Larence Fishburne is certainly one of my favorite actors, who I welcome in pretty much anything I watch, unlike this incompetent actress.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast? Eh. Who cares? Certainly a gross waste of Jeremy Irons.<br/><br/>The writing? Worthless drek.<br/><br/>Stay far away from this garbage.<br/><br/>My 2Â¢ worth.<br/><br/>*********SPOILERS EVERYWHERE******** This is not an adaptation of the original Watchmen graphic novel. This is a continuation. So yes, it has a very different look and feel than the comic and the previous movie.<br/><br/>This is very politically charged. The original graphic novel was, as well. Although they had to tone it down for DC comics to publish it, Moore and Gibbons created it as a backlash to politics of the time. They used an alternate universe setting to make it more palatable for readers. But if you missed the subtext in the original graphic novel, please read some interviews with Moore about his view on it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this series embraces the spirit of the original graphic novel's commentary on current power struggles in America. Just as the original was set in the time period it was published, this is set in a mirror of our current time period, extrapolating how the previous world would have evolved.<br/><br/>It's okay not to like it. Fans of the graphic novel may not like it because it's different. People who are easily triggered by racial politics will definitely not like it. But if you enjoyed the bleak brutality of the graphic series, and are not afraid to see a different view of what America could be in a completely fictional and hypothetical alternate universe, then this is a well crafted example of world building. So glad this got canceled its an insult to the original. With great lines like "if we dont have walls it all comes tumbling down.
Now, those walls are strong but it wont stay that way if even a little bit of yolk gets mixed in with the whites.
So thats why youve got to seperate them, tada!", you know they must have a crack writing that deals in nuance and subtlety.<br/><br/>Well defined superheros like, woman who wears a leather jacket and white turtle neck, suck you into the watchmens world.<br/><br/>And the pod idea is just genius. So much more visually exiting than a lie detector test, though apparently less effective in every way.<br/><br/>Obviously, hitting a man in the face with a suicide tablet in his mouth will make him spit it out.<br/><br/>O yeah, and obviously the chief is the bad guy. Wow they really blew this didn't they? Trivializing racism? Not cool. Patched together 1 or 2 things from the comics top brand it watchmen and give it a jump on fanbase. It's a decent show, but gets a 1 star from me for lying about what it is and running off the coattails of a comic it has nothing to do with. If you still wonder what coastal elitist Hollywood execs think about middle America, this series will tell you. They've fallen so hard for the hoax of white supremacy that they are creating completely unbelievable villains that are supposed to represent Trump supporters. Divisive, disconnected, disrespectful, garbage. No one seems to be able to construct a watchable story any more, Star Wars, Doctor Who, now this, so instead they focus on political correctness and if you complain you're the bad guy.
Remember how good tv and movies used to be, everything nowadays is cheap, watered down and soulless. You've got to grab your audience's attention in the first ten minutes, this lost mine in 2. Eventually I gave up on this after 40 minutes, got tired of being preached to, don't know what it's supposed to be, granted I never read the comics, but it's nothing like the film.
I find it highly suspicious that all the reviews on here are bad, yet it's supposedly beating the Walking Dead (Another show suffering from a serious case of bad writing) on viewing ratings, and nothing but booming reviews else where hmmm.
I agree with the other bad reviews on here, with the way the world is atm, this is the last thing we need on the telly stirring things up. People watch tv to take their brain out of reality for a bit, not to further rile them up. Not me. This is quintessential "whypipo bad" tv series of all time. Don't waste your time on this. And I hope this will wake(heh) more people, who will happen to stumble upon this pile of garbage, to growing torrent of woke Hollywood propaganda. Made it through the third episode, then just got tired of being told how bad white people are. If there was a point to all of this, I could not care enough to hang around and find out what it was. I can honestly say this is the worst example of reverse racism I've come across since M.A.N.T.I.S. Huge disappointment. I've watched the first two episodes now and waited on the second one before leaving a review. I truly hoped it would get better. It got better fractionally. Like from the 1-Star I would have left last week to the 2-star I'm leaving now. It's horrible. I can't even go beyond that because what the writers have done here is akin to using the Mona Lisa as toilet paper. They've soiled the name of the Watchmen. Trash. garbage once again and a complete waste of source material. It's boring and lacks a good story with characters that you actually give about.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. Watch Snyder's version instead. I love the entire comic world and lore of Watchmen and every single character in it. I love, even more so how the director of the movie made slight changes to the characters and story, most of them good, and stayed true to the feeling of the comic. You know what I love the most about this new show? How they scrapped everything that made Watchmen good and turned into political garbage and race baiting.
OH WAIT NO, THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I WANT IN ANY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT AT ALL TODAY!
Thank you creator of Lost, one of the worst shows I've ever seen, for destroying another franchise. I almost had faith that I'd come to find a show I actually liked that was made in the last five years. Ten years after the original film, the series was initially felt like a bad idea considering the cult the movie has gained. But indeed the intensity risen episode after episode, and the final episode did a happy ending and an amazing job.<br/><br/>The story was perfectly balanced without contaminating the continuing story. Not only in the sense of superheroism, this series showed the injustice to the colored people during early 40s till 90s. The most amazing episode was 'This Extraordinary Being".<br/><br/>Less action more intensity, The Watchmen is a changing aspect for DC when it comes to TV shows. I hope the 2nd season would come sooner.<br/><br/>I would rate 4.5/5 for "WATCHMEN" The sheer guts it too to make Rorschach (in symbolism) the head of a white supremacist terror cell. The sheer nerve it took to make watchmen a hierarchical police unit, lead my a 'cowboy' that holds speeches about terrorists only sleeping, and 'so glad, we already know where they all are'. The sheer *lost for words* to make 'do you believe in squids as interdimensional beings' a 'control question' for - are you a terrorist. But luckily we give them state police them cool tropes from the original - so everyone cheers at the right intervals.<br/><br/>Takes every trope, and all symbolism of the original (highly moral beings, adventure seekers, mathnerds - coming to understand tough decisions within societal processes), flips it on its head. And makes out of it another tale about american patriotism.<br/><br/>Adds 20 cow carcasses just for visual effect and cool factor in the first episode.<br/><br/>Alan Moore must rotate in despair and disbelieve right now. Have you no mercy. Not even with artists? Not even with stories that originated at the edges of society? This is the old bait and switch, we're all used to clickbait thumbnails but this takes it to a whole new level. what idiot gave the thumbs up for the PILOT episode to NOT MAKE ANY SENSE?! this would have been perfectly acceptable if the entire series was available all at once... but releasing weekly AND making zero sense right off the bat was a huge mistake. i don't know where this show is going, and after that ridiculous pilot i have little to no interest whatsoever. i may give it another chance after the season ends but it's highly unlikely.<br/><br/>P.S. this has nothing to do with the watchmen and Like others out there, I found myself questioning why I was forcing myself to watch this show. Not having any good reason to waste my time, I simply shut it off. If I wanted to watch a depiction of the Tulsa Race riot of 1921, I'd probably find a documentary. This production is sadly just another way someone has found a way to force their very strong political opinion down audiences throats. This feels like the viewers have been tricked into watching something they wouldn't have watched- a bit like false advertising in a way. Dark gritty great cast, riveting On Episode 3 can't stop watching - just watch it The only thing thing this has in common with the original movie appears to be the title.
They've taken a tragic true event that occurred nearly a hundred years ago, and used it as the basis for a cartoon alternative reality.
The pilot show was disjointed, confusing and banal. None of the characters came over as genuinely believable.
If the first show of a series is the showcase, then I won't be buying into it. This is not Watchmen. What is it? HBO's Watchmen is an example of a story's theme run amok. A TV show should not make you feel like your being preached to about social issues. I never read the comics. Only saw the zack snyder film. I am writing this after watching the pilot.<br/><br/>Watchmen is about a different world than ours. Here the police force wears masks to cover their identity. In the pilot the main threat was a white supremacist group in rorshach masks. If the movie i watched closely followed the comics i would say this series is going to be different. There are many easter eggs and callbacks though. The pilot revolves around the main characters finding out about the threat and gearing up to stand against it. The way that happens kept my intrigue. They didn't let the story fall flat, there was always some momentum. It had some aptly handled tense scenes. Not too flashy action scenes but they had a punch, held interest for me. Acting was as good as it can be. There wasn't any scene that called for amazing, stand out acting. The actors and actresses did the best that can be done. There were competent character interactions inbetween. Also good tease for things to come. So, all over i wasn't bored at all. Along with the satisfying character interaction and up to the mark action and tense scenes, i was enterntained. I was hooked enough to want to see what would come next. Would definitely check out the next episode. The production is really good. Aesthetic is eye cathing. I liked how it's edited, i specially liked some transitions. The music is very well produced. There's a synth track i would like to get my hands on. So, an interesting pilot. I don't have a deep knowledge of the comics, but as far as I know, this have very little to do with the original... A modern take on a classic isn't a bad thing in itself.. but this one is steeped in to much modern political correctness, that half could have been enough.. Total disgrace of a show, just more in your face  towards whites disguised as 'political correctness'. So aparently everyone is trashing this show because of the race issues? Come on people, now taking that aside, this show has really started strong, respecting the characters of the original graphic novel but also introducing new ones, and if you're a big fan of Watchmen, you will love the references, can't wait for the next episode. Too many people on here finding horrendous reasons to rate the show low. No character development? No story? Not close to Watchmen? Its only the first episode people! Maybe these people are hurt because they fear the show will scrutinize the exact same entitled behavior these reviewers exhibit. So here is my 10/10, in an attempt to balance the scales, one step at a time. This feels like they took the name Watchmen as an attempt to rope in old fans and capitalize on its critical reception. Then, they made a show about things that seem very controversial so people would feel they have call it brilliant or seem like they weren't getting it. Add in plenty of little mysteries which Lindelof will continue to sprinkle in without ever doing a good job of tying together (ehem...Lost and Leftovers) and this show seems like it's destined to keep building until ending complete lack of payoff.
Long story short, they should probably leave the legacy of Watchmen out of this and let Lindelof make another protracted non payoff without sullying a classic comic. Complete crap. I had such high hopes for this series. For some strange reason I thought it would be like the original graphic novel or the big screen movie. Start with as absurd plot and throw in a little gratuitous sex and violence and you get a show only a 15 year old could love. It is ridiculously self-indulgent. The IMDB reviews/scores are much more realistic that the current Rotten Tomatoes scores. The series shows promise and after the fourth episode, I can say that I am excited to find out where this story leads. I think the characters are interesting and can it wait to learn more about them! Pure, unadulterated garbage. Absolutely nothing to do with the comic other than the name. Riddled with copaganda, it is an absolute disgrace to the original comic and the movie. Total and utter pc trash exactly what I expected
And I see the shills and bots defending the travesty Funny thing about the ignorant turds calling the real fans of the source material "trolls" is hilarious. Yes we're trolls because we see this show is garbage and has pretty much nothing to do with "WATCHMEN" and is filled with political garbage, very disappointed. These guys praising this crap are the real "trolls"
Would give is 1 but the visuals are actually decent. Weird, confusing and unlikable. Who are the good guys and who are the bad and do I care? I watched the first, now I am going to delete and never think about it again. What where they thinking? Missed the mark big time. Could of made a 100 different narratives and it would of been better.
It's like those lame comic shows they make that are nothing to the quality of the film.
FAIL. This show looks like its going to be pretty good. The reviews at low stars are likely from snowflakes who are offended by racial topics, but i think it has a lot more going for it. Cant wait for the rest. Never expected that it would be too boring. Experienced headache after 15 minute watch, better not to watch this Damon Lindelof's modern day remix of Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel is brimming with style. His trademark storytelling mechanics, which we've seen in Lost and The Leftovers, are also present here. The characters are interesting and the story off to a great start. Sad PC have taken this art and turned it into propaganda! Boring dumb and overreaching , it has spilt all the goodness onto the floor.
What we are left with is disappointing dreadful , shame . After watching the pilot i did not feel like I got hooked on this show but rather the opposite. There was no character that really caught my attention or made me feel like i want to know what happens next.
Confusing at times, weird music choice, not intriguing. definitely one of the worst pilots I've seen.<br/><br/>I am going to keep watching but with way lower expectations. Cringey cinematography/editing. Poorly written. Bad acting. Just bad. A few exceptions of course, but that's the main take in the first episode. Buy the rights to the Watchmen name and then proceeds to make a train wreck !! Nothing to do whatsoever with the awesome Alan Moore graphic novel ! The writer of the show supports race based reparations for black people. So he tried to force that agenda on the show and it backfired. I'm not even American so I couldn't care less about their politics but Hollywood please stop ruining classics. I read my other reviews and I usually say what the show meant to me. This show, I can't find the words.<br/><br/>I'm watching this show far after it came out and by now the creator and production team have taken a walk. When I finished this show I was all at once incredibly pissed that Lindelof hung his hat and proud of him.<br/><br/>This one season of tv was special and he didn't want to sully something amazing by continuing something that you never know when your passion might be diverted. I wonder if Lost inspired this. I don't say this because I hated the ending. It certainly isn't what I wanted nor expected but I have realized regardless of what explanation I got I wouldn't be pleased.<br/><br/>I don't know what I would have received from this show if it had continued but I am proud of a creator walking away from money when it isn't honest for them. Rather make quality than being a slave to every idea.<br/><br/>I'm also proud of HBO for realizing they didn't want it to continue if they don't have the right team. I can't say giving this show 10 stars is because it is perfect...because what is perfect? I gave this show for what it is (an amazing story that I don't care to consider anything as paltry as plot holes) but more importantly for what I didn't want or need to be.<br/><br/>In a way their exit said exactly what they wanted the end of the show to say. The series strives to change ideas and deconstruct the Rorschach character. Apart from graphic novel, this one is heavily invested in current American politics, not global. If you don't live there or not following their politics and social issues, this show has very little to offer. Great production value, great actors, it's just boring. I don't know what's it like for Americans tho. Yes we all have opinions and there may be some people who no nothing of the source material of the comic or movie and may have truly enjoyed this show....BUT for the vast majority of fans of comics and the movie this show is absolugte trash, has nothing to do with the comic or movie, the cast is full of terrible and the story is pure crap. They're more focused on race bending and changing the characters races and making other characters look racist or making political statements than actually making a proper TV show with good story.... Completely baffled by this ??? watchmen ???? where ???? The film was great i don't know what i expected ???? Definitely not this plot less rubbish will it get better ???? Who cares !!!!! The original watchmen, both the comics and the movie, was about the bigger picture. How to stop a cold war, what is time, the meaning of life........overall a philosophical piece.<br/><br/>This pilot expand on the most uninteresting part of the comics, the people and the smaller pieces on the board. I want to know what dr.Manhattan is doing not who the cops are shooting. It like watching GOT from the perspective of a foot soldier. Boring. In addition to obvious references to current American political atmosphere, which everyone is tired of, the pilot can't seem to decide if it wants to be political drama, satire, social commentary, or comic book entertainment. It weirdly mixes old and new tech, it weirdly mixes old and new culture, it doesn't explain things and behaviour that simply doesn't fit. You are left wondering when, where and why, but with a bad taste of current reality in your mouth. It reminds you of heavy history in one scene, then tries to be funny in the next. Characters are not developed, you are expected to figure them out on the fly. If a sense of mystery was the intention, it turned out to be more like a puzzle you have no motivation to put together. Funny though, because choice of actors is good, dialogue is decent and production quality is good. It's just not mixed and baked well. No trolling here. Genuine thoughts from someone who has no idea of the comics but enjoyed the movie, which this show has nothing to do with other than they mentions Dr Manhattan a few times. Looking at it completely independently, it's just weird and, dare I say, stupid. I'm two episodes in and anything that resembles a plot is yet to reveal itself. I understand racism is a huge issue in ol 'merica, but the rest of us all get along so a show about a bunch of the finest masked KKK types I've seen, doesn't really hit home. The acting is great and the visual production quality is high, but none of that means jack if the core of the show itself is bad. And this is bad. By now I should be starting to care about something, anything, instead I've stopped watching and decided to write my first ever IMDb review. Anyway, I urge you to make you own opinion but if you don't make it to episode 3, you are not alone. Giving this a 4 PURELY because am a huge fan of most of the cast. Otherwise, 1 star. I can't even begin to fathom how this show has a rating above a 5. It has some of the worst writing on a TV series I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. The acting was just "okay". And the theme and music choices were sub par.<br/><br/>I usually do not review. I usually do not even bother to make accounts on websites like this. But I felt as a human being it was my duty to inform the public not to watch this trash. I wasted my hour so you don't have to. It's bad to say the least. Terrible in fact.<br/><br/>Most of all, who was this even made for? It's nothing like the comic. In fact, I feel like fans of the comic will be insulted. It's nothing like the movie, so there goes that fan base as well. It's filled with political pandering, so most normal people, or people who just want to relax and watch interesting shows like myself also will hate it.<br/><br/>I feel like this was made solely for the "professional" critics who everyone usually disagrees with or just outright hates and the annoying Twitter crowd who do nothing but sit on them all day crying about this and that.<br/><br/>I guess the only thing I liked about it was that the set pieces and production was pretty nice, but that's obviously going to be at least half decent when you throw money at it. It's too bad they wasted their money on trash. But it's a pretty piece of trash. Like a two dollar hooker who remembered to brush their teeth this time. I absolutely loved Watchmen! It is a thrilling dramatic series that will keep you entertained every episode with its powerful storytelling! It seems that most of the people who don't like it seem to be the right wingers! Once Don Johnson came in with the musical number I hoped HBO would just choke and die for what they did. Terrible, terrible, terrible. They destroyed the Watchmen name. I assume all the plot holes will be wrapped up in the coming episodes, but I must ask, what's the point? The pilot writing is bland and all over the place. The characters actions, as echoed in other reviews, make little to no sense.<br/><br/>I was not impressed with the set pieces, which the actors seemed uncomfortable in. The acting is subpar at best, and I found the lead to be forced and unbelievable. Furthermore, none of the characters are very likable.<br/><br/>
I found very little to be redeeming about the episode, stopping to ask myself multiple times what the show is even about? What is it aiming to say?<br/><br/>
Literally, the first "bad guy" we meet is a white man, with an American flag hat, beard, drinking and driving, while listening to the rapper Future, and hauling a truck full of lettuce. This makes a police man nearby uncomfortable, and he "magically" appears behind the bad guy to pull him over.<br/><br/>Unbelievable dialogue ensues, and apparently both men decide they need their guns because the other has made them so suspicious: White man kills cop and throws lettuce at him.<br/><br/>
BAM! That is your bad guy(s)! No other background given, no other reasons to like or dislike the main character, or the bad guys for that matter, other than their race, is ever given or explained.<br/><br/>It's literally a pick your poison of bad screenwriting and 2019 cliches.<br/><br/>The main "action" sequence of the pilot episode is a cow farm "shoot-em-up" where the heroes hide behind cow carcasses while getting shot at by mounted machine guns. No seriously. We spend five to ten minutes hearing the sound effects of cows dying and flesh smushing, while the heroes yell over each other and do nothing - yet all survive!<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's literally nothing new - all the tropes we have seen before, just done more poorly. I can't think of one original thing about this pilot episode that sticks with me...<br/><br/>It's run-of-the-mill race-baiting for a plot, and depending on your side of politics, you can either pretend it services you and you enjoy it, or you can refuse to have a lame-brain plot like this stuffed down your throat.<br/><br/>
I'm giving this 3 stars out of 10 simply because it is a watchable TV show, yet not enjoyable.<br/><br/>I might even check out episode 2 to see if I was wrong at all with my analysis, but the glaring issues, backwards politics, and lack of creativity really hamper any future Watchmen could have. Not the best, HBO. OVER this kind of "entertainment"! This is NOTHING like Watchmen... the movie or the book. Don't waste your time. I expected so much more considering the cast and participants. I was very disappointed in the end product and removed it from my watchlist. Unlike the movie "the watchmen" this new series has a difficult time with its world building. It gave me no interest in any of its characters, no explanation as why it is the way it is. After it's first episode I walk away, uninterested in its next episode and feeling nothing. I'm really bummed, this could have been something great. Episode 1 was bad. Nobody I watched it with understood what was going on.
There wan't very much character development and the plot was incoherent.<br/><br/>This show doesn't merit a deeper discussion. Didn't know about this show and thought cool a series about the watchmen, since I quite enjoyed the movie...... To my disappointment it's not really Watchmen, I was hoping for more of the same like the movie instead this seems more like a Roots 1977 show about racism. Nothing wrong with that tbh but why call it Watchmen?<br/><br/>It was also kind of confusing considering I kept thinking okay maybe The Watchmen will show up now..instead Rorschach is now a white supremacists group?<br/><br/>Dunno but I think I will stop watching this Watchmen series as it's not really what I want in a comic book based tv show. The first episode was so bad I could barely make it through the entire show. Nothing made sense and it seems the writer and director had never seen or read ANYTHING that had to do with Watchmen. I'd rather watch the entire 8th season if GOT again before I'd watch this. I expected so much from this TV series, but what did I get from it...nothing. I don't want to talk much about this show cause it's badðŸ˜‘ I'm getting tired of this omnipresent liberal agenda, you people know any other topics than lgbt and racism?
3 stars after the first episode, I may watch the second one if it doesn't get better I'm giving up<br/><br/>Edit after the second episode: I'm changing my rating to 1 star and not going to waste more time on this. Not only this is just another show off of liberal propaganda but it seems to glorify antifa-like actions with all these masks and using violence to "fight racism". So, they are supposed to be the new superheroes? This is actually the most cringeworthy message I have ever seen on TV The pilot episode just plain did not make sense. I haven't read the graphic novel, I've only watched the movie, but from what I understand this right here seemingly has nothing to do with either. It's clearly not set in the movieverse as there were zero references to it or any of it's characters. I read the synopsis of the graphic novel and none of this existed there either.<br/><br/>So I guess I just don't get it? It was basically a series of disconnected plot sequences without any context or explanation. As far as I can tell it's just about white people being evil while wearing rorschach masks, which doesn't make sense as the actual character Rorschach was against things like racism, so why would they be wearing his mask?<br/><br/>I'll probably watch a couple more episodes to see what happens but this pilot did not make me want to continue with this series, it honestly just like one big convoluted "woke" mess. Most the people giving this glowing reviews either have nothing to say or it's just an endless stream of pretentious nonsense. The only thing that has to do with watchmen is nothing so far.hbo either does amazing shows or utter thrash. this is utter trash. dont even bother if you think this has to do with watchmen. the first hour has nothing to do with it. i want my hour back please. Despite the spectacular visual world, he was not at all bound. There was no motivation. The characters are boring, characterless. No acting, no emotions. Cinematography is good, that's the only thing you can watch. I have no urge to look at the next section. Many scenes are unrelated to the storyline, but don't raise questions so much as to make it interesting. I'm sorry about that. Annoying as hell and stupid af, The Watchmen TV series packs all the cringeworthy you can stomach in a twitchy tv show. The credit sequence of the original film is better than this show. What do you do when you are complete void of original ideas, or incapable of producing a good, entertaining show on its own merit?<br/><br/>Jack it up with senseless, brainless, tasteless and shallow political correctness.<br/><br/>Just look at RT - a 95+% score from the "critics", vs. low 40% from average audience, that'd say something.<br/><br/>What a time we live in, you look left, you look right, there is no escape from politics what so freaking ever. Everything is saturated with it, even fantasy TV shows.<br/><br/>Go for it HBO. I am out. I was initially entranced. I immediately searched the net for Tulsa 1921, and was shocked to find out the depiction of events in this episode were strikingly realistic. It's a shame that the show then descends into cliche.<br/><br/>Race-baiting is at best boring, and irresponsible to say the least. I almost stopped watching multiple times, but hung on hoping they were going somewhere interesting. The "climactic" final scene was unfortunately totally predictable.<br/><br/>The target audience of this show is obviously a narrow demographic and it grotesquely stereotypes other demographics. Oh, and it doesn't appear to have any real relation to Watchmen. It has 0 charm that the original movie!<br/><br/>I was shocked at how bad this first episode was because it seemed as though Lindelof had mastered the first episode as we had seen in Lost and The Leftovers, but this was just flat out crap. Not sure what they were thinking here. It is clear that this show could have had immense success due to the popularity of the original comic and the movie. But the creators just went the completely other way, and wanted to "create something new" I guess.<br/><br/>Well, the result is a mess, at least based on the pilot. As someone mentioned in another review, not a single character in this Pilot caught my interest in a way that would keep me watching. I will check Episode 2 just to make sure, but with muuuuch lowered expectations.<br/><br/>I really wish they at least chose some more appropriate music that would create an atmosphere that actually fits "Watchmen". They just took a big dump on the watchmen name with this weird thing they made Unfortunately the new HBO series had nothing to do with the works of Alan Moore. Sadly just a copy and paste of all the other politically aware shows. For the first time I can sympathise with others who have complained about similar problems with other shows.
The themes, world and characters do not fit into the Watchmen universe and this can only be described as a tragedy. I know it's easy to think everyone with this opinion is alt-right but I'm really liberal. I just love the original novel and this series makes Zacks movie look like a true masterpiece.
Whilst some characters have been intriguing with Lindelof at the helm, I have no hope for the future of this show.
In summary this isn't where I saw things going after the bomb. I think the universe and characters are so rich they deserved to be fleshed out. With plenty of mysteries still unresolved in-between the pages of the original graphic novel, this seems like a massively wasted opportunity.
I recommend a copy of the original novel for everyone at Christmas regardless of if you're a comics fan. Read it and then be immensely disappointed at this butchering. Started interesting, but became very disappointing. I was hoping for a show about the watchmen comic but this is a race bating, anti white, liberal political TV show that should be on MSNBC. After the second episode I canceled HBO. I loved the source material, enjoyed the movie, and rate Damon Lindelof's previous work - Lost and The Leftovers - really highly, so was very much looking forward to this, but it was just incredibly poor. Some other reviews bang on about race and political agenda, but viewed solely as a piece of television, I found the first episode boring, muddled, and full of uninteresting characters I just didn't care about. I feel sorry for Jeremy Irons being a part of this. He - and the viewers - all deserved better than this mess which thinks it's saying something important but really is just mumbling incoherently through a poorly fitting mask. Its some artsy fartsy yuppies wet dream to take a solid franchise and integrate some awful racial identity politics into a franchise that has nothing to do with that. The pilot was extremely weak and boring almost the entire way through. It kept some original watchmen fans interested with mere nano seconds of well known characters from the original franchise. Mixed along with the boring plot line and terrible pacing that will put you to sleep. They did a fab job with the trailers, I'll give them that. Too bad its going to be a one season let down show. If you are looking for your next series time sink. This isn't going to be one of them. The show tries to be critical, but just ends up being shallow and empty. I didn't get through the pilot on first try. I was expecting something more similar to the comic. The tone is quite faitfhul to the original and the production is cool, but writing is just awful. This has almost nothing to do with the Watchmen. Tries to get through the first episode but just couldn't. Once the lead character began going on about how she could smell supremacy I knew exactly what it was about. Feel free to waste your time but don't expect much. All Questions and Not a SINGLE ANSWER. I've never seen an opening Episode of a series so ALL OVER THE MAP. Hard to figure out if I want to continue or not.. one more episode with no answers and it'll be a hard "NO" between all the Race Baiting and the Crazy plotline it reminds me of what a Rich Californian PC BLM Antifa kid would produce in Film School.. I would give it a D- One of many gripes I had with the Zack Snyder movie interpretation of the Watchmen graphic novel was the fact that even with the 3+ hour run time, certain plot elements were glossed over and certain themes were cut out altogether. Elements of the comics were directly and inappropriately copy and pasted, into the movie, affecting the pacing and lead to my overall dislike of the movie.<br/><br/>With the opportunity to present Alan Moore's story through a more suitable medium, a TV show, It is quite impressive how they managed to disrespect and tarnish the original comic more than Snyder could ever have hoped to do.<br/><br/>The lengths that these writers will go to in order to spread their social justice messages is absolutely disgraceful and jarring.<br/><br/>The original watchmen story tackled themes such as international conflict, morality, the ambiguity between good and evil, whilst also presenting the underbelly of being a superhero at a time were the characters were only a stale, stoic stereotype.<br/><br/>This instead takes all that, throws all of it in the trash, and instead: presents a story about white supremacy and racial inequality? Never was this a plot element of the original story, and the fact it is the main story arch in the show is dumbfounding. This story has no correlation between the original gripping Alan Moore story, only using the name for recognition and to obtain undeserved viewership for their show.<br/><br/>The problem with the show is not that it tackles political themes. Regardless of your views on how the media seems to always demonize white men, the original comic was also controversial in it's own pejorative anti-war themes. The only difference is that the watchmen TV show is ONLY themes and no substance. It priorities on it's message, forgetting to tell a compelling story with compelling characters or a story that is actually related to the comic it's name is derived from.<br/><br/>The "Seventh Kavalry" are a group of white men in the series who are "inspired" by Rorschach to "take up arms" - basically a parallel to the KKK. Now, if you've watched or read the original story, you would know that this plot device makes absolutely ZERO sense as Rorschach diary entries from the original story are explicitly shown to the audience and have nothing to do with race or even the police (again - strictly about morality and anti-war). It is glaringly obvious that they couldn't care less about the original character and what his motives were, instead, using him to push their agenda through a nonexistent link to "racism".<br/><br/>Ozymandias is portrayed as an antagonist in the series. Looking at him from the original story, he is one of the most compelling characters in the novel. He IS NOT BAD, his actions are directly related to bringing the end of the cold war by employing a plan to kill millions of people (again - themes of morality and antiwar). He was never the "bad guy", shown by DR. Manhattan's approval of Ozymandias' plan, understanding that by "killing millions" they could "save billions".<br/><br/>Ozymandias in the series; "He is rich and white and has servants and looks menacing therefore he is bad"<br/><br/>Baseless Easter eggs like the owl ship in the first episode and reference to DR.Manhattans origin further prove that the writers of the show don't actually care about ruining the original source material and rather just take the watchmen brand for the name recognition and the its unique stylistic features (the only """good""" thing about the show).<br/><br/>Aside from the appalling misunderstanding of the original story and characters, the shows club of main characters are caricatures; self praising and out right perfect in any way, no flaws whatsoever with no characters to cause internal conflict or challenge the audience to consider multiple sides of a conflict, you know, the complete opposite of the original watchmen story and precisely what made that story a classic to begin with. There are the good guys and there are the white guys, good guys beat the white guys and that is supposed to be compelling for some reason.<br/><br/>It is a smart move, having a story that centers around it's themes of race, rather than an actual good story, therefore people like me who have actual criticisms for the show are labelled trolls or racists for not liking the show.<br/><br/>The show is boring, and embodies everything that an audience hates about contemporary TV shows, a lack of understanding of what makes a show good, lack of understanding of why people liked the original story and a push towards the favoring of political themes and agendas over an actual good story or plot. Rather than being a deep and interesting look into the underbelly of morality and global politics, it just seems like it is an episode by episode series of Law and Order "Which racist white guy is Sister Knight going to beat up next week?". I've never left a review for a tv show before, but I'm so frustrated with this I had to vent. Just very disappointing. We deserve better than this.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I think the next bad review I write will be for The Witcher. Victim-chic junkies of the world unite & take over - T.V.<br/><br/>The above is exactly what's happening these days & this adaptation of Watchmen is no different. Give the audience a break! Please!<br/><br/>Like the creator of Watchmen, I'm not American, ergo, I have no interest in internal US political fads. I want something more universal; which is what the original Watchmen offered.<br/><br/>Visually: It may induce epileptic fits.
Narrative: Childlike (as subtle as a lump hammer).<br/><br/>N.B. It's not the audience's job to do the work. I guess this is supposed to be some heavy-handed "shoe on the other foot" thing but some of the things they drop in the first episode are INTENDED to piss people off. The idea that not everyone has to pay taxes (wanna guess who does and doesn't?) is risable. Reparation I can understand, but revenge oppression is just about guaranteed to start a civil war when it's the majority being oppressed; I'm betting that voting rights are skewed, too.<br/><br/>A lot of people are calling the poor reviews "right-wing extremism" but there's an awful lot of extremism going on on-screen, such as a police officer standing by while a vigilante beats a man (in custody!) to death to get some answers.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's an effed up world and was at the end of Watchmen, but who wants to wallow in hopelessness for entertainment? Give me something more hopeful, like The Walking Dead. What's up with all of this ridiculous black vs. white nonsense that fit with leftists' racial fantasyland? None of it were directly coming from the comic I've read.<br/><br/>I noticed all of these "positive" reviewers stated "Ha ha! Right-wing hate this show" and "White supremacist are the real issue in this country" like to show us of how low I.Q. they have, and they are no different than what these Hollywood and left-wing politicians had shown on daily basis.<br/><br/>Poor show, and I doubt season 2 will come. I'm confused at what this show is about because the plot was not apparent. All I have learned is that it correlated race and violence. This show is overall reckless because it may incite violence if it continues down this rabbit hole. Clearly Hollywood's goal is to create more division.. Watched first episode. What was that???? Really disappointed. There is nothing from original watchmen in this movie. And there is something wrong with the whole idea. So many 'good' black people and they are fighting with the 'bad' white people. I don't like the idea at all. I think it's all disgusting. I tried to censor some potentially offensive words in my review since IMDB will remove it otherwise but they wont tell me what words offended them so if you see something spelt weird or a word that doesnt quite fit just use your imagination.
Let me start by saying that the watchmen is likely my all time favorite story with v for vendetta as a close second, ive read both graphic novels and watched both movies and i loved them each for what they are. I was incredibly excited when i found out they were making a show based on the watchmen and that excitement doubled when i realised it was HBO making the show because they do so many shows so incredibly well.
I thought that if anyone could live up to the name and do watchmen justice it would be HBO but i was so very wrong, i dont know whats happened to HBO first game of thrones and now this, they used to be so good, the wire is probably my favorite series ever just because HBO seemed to have this way of presenting each side so that you never really knew who the good guys and bad guys were, every single character was incredibly 3d and you could relate to people on both sides.
I felt the same way when i saw watchmen the movie it was like you didnt really know who you were rooting for, obviously the superheroes were the good guys for the most part but they did things that made you hate them at times and feel bad for the people they "watched" over because they were just normal people who were fully fleshed out 3d characters with their virtues and their vices.
This has nothing to do with the watchmen, the fact that it supposedly takes place in the same universe adds absolutely nothing to the plot although i cant seem to find any trace of a plot anywhere.
This is a show about the good guys vs the bad guys, the good guys are cops and the bad guys are rural white racist folk. There are no surprises, there is no social commentary, there are no deep philosophical ideas about right and wrong or how people should live and interact in a society like the watchmen novel and movie had. If you want any of that then please avoid this show like the plague or you will be intensely disappointed.
There seems to be very little direction or character development which is strange because usually the pilot episode introduces you to the cast and the premise of the show and gives you a reason to care about the story and worry about the direction its going in.
But this show is painfully obvious where its going, there aren't any surprises or suspense. If it wasnt for the crazy high production value i would have guessed that id just watched a highschool theater club project.
The show itself probably isnt that bad if your walking into it without ever having seen watchmen before and if you have absolutely no expectations of it being half decent. But the way they stole the watchmen name and then shate all over it has me incredibly disappointed. They got my expectations high and then dropped them so fast im left dizzy and disoriented.
As long as you watch the show knowing that its essentially violence corn, just a bunch of cops beating the shirt out of skinheads with no actual plot then you might enjoy it. But if your looking for plot, social commentary, philosophy, super heroes, or anything else you may think of when you hear the name watchmen then dont waste your time with this show.
Thats an hour of my life that i wont get back plus 30 minutes to make an account and write my first imdb review, i cant believe this show is rated 7/10 the skeptic in me wants to believe its some kind of astro turfing with people being paid to give 10 stars and say generic things like "i dont know how anyone could give this a bad review" so the show doesnt look as bad as it really is.
But i know there are lots of people who just want to put a show on and then stare at facebook on their phones and wait for the overly intense music to tell them when they should look at the screen to see the violence and root for the good guys, they dont want to have to think about the story or try to figure out who is right or wrong they just want to be told this guy is evil and this guy a saint so they know who to hate and who to care about. Nothing to do with "Watchmen". It's dull and boring, not easy to watch at all. Yet all the critic tell you how marvelous it is. Which in my book is usually a bad sign, as the more media critics rave about something. You can bet the guy in the street will hate it. Really annoyed, kept on watching and hoping the set up will somehow come together but sadly no. It's confusing and boring. I tried to be as open minded as possible, but it just didn't work. This show does not let you do that. It forces politics into your face and attempts to force you to agree with them.<br/><br/>I don't care so much about the politics, but the fact that that's all the show really has going for it.<br/><br/>It's not good. Not at all. Don't waste your time like I did. I've never made a review of a Movie or TV show before, but felt I had to do my duty as a person to stop you the viewer from wasting your time and poisoning your mind with absolute trash. God, is it awful. I feel like I've lost several points of intelligence for simply sitting down and watching this. I hate everyone involved in making this. You're all terrible people for putting something like this out to the public. What were you thinking? Was really excited for this show, and it's just awful. Bad writing. Mediocre script. Plot is yet another agenda pushing sht show. They just slapped the name watchmen on it the get visibility. What a shame I watched the first episode and could not come up with any reason to continue watching this. I don't care about any of the characters or the story. It's one of those shows when, after you watch the first season, you're left with nothing. Only the same unlikeable characters and frustrating story line where nothing is resolved. And you only have yourself to blame for holding out hope that it would somehow turn into something worthwhile. If you want to make a racial/political show, create your own universe don't pollute Watchmen. Another example of a woke show with no real substance. Marvel decides to tear down any potential rival, and sets its eye on the movie watchmen.
It decides to make an awful series of watchmen, and successfully destroys its reputation by supporting the follow up series it as bad as possible. I thought they couldn't film Watchmen again worse than the original movie, I was wrong. I couldn't watch half an episode it was that bad. I had this preset and was looking forward to an excellent new series. By running on our Fox Showcase (AU) Which normally runs only the best or highest rating series. What have I wasted an hour on today. It just does not work, what is it that the producers / show runners want people to see here? I was going to rate a 2 but will try next weeks episode, but I feel this will be the last I here or see of the Watchmen. Very disappointed. As a huge Watchmen & comic book fan this is absolutely diabolical. End this travesty immediately ! I'm actually not bothered that it was raining squids. That fits the original story.<br/><br/>It lost me when she got out of the car with a squidgy. Do they not have windshield wipers in this universe? I'm not kidding. if you abandon logic for spectacle, you've lost me forever. Is there a reason she had to get out of the car to clean the squids off? Well u know it's slow it's boring it lakes meaning it feels empty... and sure why not add some politics/racisem/.... to make sure the media talkes about it/...
oh the pc colture....... is the smallest of all issues i have with this series...
so i suggest you watch it... no it's a wast of time if you'd ask me..<br/><br/>but idk it's very new maybe it'll get better -in such a case i'll update my review but still the point is that... simply uh.... i won't say it was a pain to watch but it sure as hell would be much more interesting if i had some paint to paint over the tv and watch drying...
again simply boring nothing else to say...<br/><br/>du i'd give the credit for great photography and the filming is great... cast and acting and... is fine i guess hard to say so far
but yeah poor plot poor everything... I expected more from this series, in general it is only a progressive series that took the name of the movie to have fame. Very bad. The only salvageable thing is the cinematography, in reality it is only a generational series that abuses the issues of conflicts such as racism or pollution. Few references from the Watchmen.<br/><br/>Obvious and weak plot. I really wanted to like it but it's not in the same league as movie. Boring, cliche. And It's another new HBO show with disgusting modern politics in it. It promotes racism towards white people. I'm tired of this. I want good story without propaganda. Time to cancel subscription and move to Amazon or Netflix. Awful 1st episode and not even going to bother watching any more. Opens with a fantastic depiction of a terrible true part of US history. Goes downhill from there. Won't go into a long review but the stupid rushed attack on the ranch with inadequate planning or personnel. The police "owl" ship crashes but the pilot and police chief walk out with not a bruise (neither was strapped in). The ending with the police chief leaving his heavily guarded home and driving off alone ending up killed by an old man in a wheelchair. Damon Lindelof had burned his goodwill with the lame ending of Lost and all the unanswered questions so I should have known better. Watch "The Boys" on Amazon for an exciting and intelligent series on superheroes. I want to see the movie again.This looks to me like just more Damon Lindelof "Lost" confused, rather senseless "happenings". Most of the reviewers so far seem to like it; maybe at 76 I'm just too old for it. Someone said "time to cancel HBO". Not me, I can't wait for "Succession" to start up again. And there's too many more great things on HBO. Btw, I also decided this evening that I've had enough of TWD. Well if you came looking for a series about a race war, this is the one for you.<br/><br/>If you came looking for something more than vaguely connected to Watchmen, not so much. This is what happens when guilt ridden people who spend too much time splitting hairs on what hurt their feelings today on twitter make a show. It's a woke-fest that could be interesting if it was actually well written and not so on the nose and eyeroll inducing. This is a hard pass so far if you have a brain in your head. It may get better, but it's not looking good. It seems that their work ,especially GOT season 8 inspired HBO to take a new turn towards B rated style material, why bother with multidimensional plots and characters when you can have all that cliches that allow us to relive an older cinema era! A well deserved applause for this show creators tho, by been crystal clear from the first episode about their intentions, they enabled all those people to avoid wasting their time watching this. If someone relates the terms fantastic or brilliant or excellent to a DC show these days you can be pretty sure that
a) it's a hired gun
b) the writer uses the method of irony
c) has no taste and thinks Fast & Furios XXX is an epic movie and one of the best of all time and deserves 1k Oscars.<br/><br/>Anyway, Watchmen is one of those cheap and fast produced DC shows, that will - thankfully - fall into total oblivion rather quick.<br/><br/>Last note: on the Tomatometer the show got 95% but the audience score is only 49% (time writing this review) - well, I guess either the pro critics or the "common" audience must be somehow rotten (or well paid) ;) Being a huge fan of the original comic and the movie based on it, I was greatly disappointed in this pilot episode. The creators took too many liberties. The image and name of the character of Rorschach that was responsible for exposing the conspiracy in the original film has been turned into some sort of white supremacy cult. How is that even a reasonable connection? The original character was about justice at any cost. His mask has been hijacked to equate racism? How? Why? Who saw that in either the comic or movie? Please explain.
The pilot's protagonist is an undercover cop that really lacks dimension. They try to make her likable but the really didn't exert too much effort to it. Don Johnson plays the chief of a police department that is no more justified than the hate group.
Overall I was hugely disappointed in this adaptation. The creator's general disdain for actually attempting to build a coherent transition from the movie to the series is staggering. Did they even research the subject matter or merely use names from a list of original characters? By what stretch of the imagination is this even truly an adaptation or continuation of the movie/comic?
Sad sad sad The fight scenes are horrible and the story is just pushing an agenda. As a fan of the graphic novel and the film I just don't feel this show Belongs. I have read the novel many times and have watched the movie at lease once a year since it's release. The Novel was always Kind of political. Since this is a modern day watchmen take on current issues, I suppose I can see why they would go with a racial approach. But it all just falls flat. The characters personalities aren't likable. The conflict that takes place in the first ep. was kind of cringy. Idk. if I was to continue watching perhaps I could get more invested in the characters and the over all plot but the first episode is suppose to provide me with a feeling of wanting more and it simply did not do that. But instead left me disappointment because this is Watchmen after all. Something I cherish. Seems to be working to a weird premise, working to some odd agenda reather than being a show about the brilliant watchmen universe. It entirely failed to intrigue me or even keep my interest. the dialogue was flat, the acting flat, the music jarring and the colours dreary. The camera angles were overly showy at times (egg scene...) and the narrative jilted. A big disappointment. Just bad on so many fronts definitely not worth watching got into it for the first episode I want my time back This was not Watchmen, this was a freak show merely wearing the skin of the original story. Just more "Florida Fruit"-Man-Bad nonsense. Flat, senseless, unconvincing acting. Poorly developed script. Overall I had a feeling that I'm watching a B movie. This should be banned. It sets "good" and "bad" based on skin color, creates stereotypes and presents the white race as a degenerate group of destructive freaks. For any open minded person, the preconceptions and subliminal messages are an intellectual offense. Shame on DC! OK, let me be clear... I just want to say that I don't care about women getting the main role of a series or "hidden" social messages or being "woke" in general.<br/><br/>If a story is well written, well balanced and have a solid structure then everything works and you have a story to tell.<br/><br/>But in HBO Watchmen it seems that nobody knows what the hell they are doing (I'm talking about the characters, the writters and the viewers)<br/><br/>First of all... the main characters: oh my... what a mess. The main issue with them is that you, as a viewer, don't know their motivations (I'm in EP 4 and I don't clearly understand what exactly Sister Night want to achieve or Red Scare or Looking Glass in general) they want to stop a race war? the russians? Being the protectors of Oklahoma or America? We don't know what the hell they want or why they decided to fight crime at all.<br/><br/>Next: the legacy of the original Watchmen. It seems that Rorschach became a symbol of hate and now he's the Nathan Bedford Forrest for a bunch of white dudes fans of Richard Nixon (Â¿?).<br/><br/>Adrien Veidt is now a parody of himself. Laurie Blake (which is the more interesting character in the whole series) is now. just like her father, a tool of the government to take down "masked vigilantes"...<br/><br/>Sometimes you feel like you are watching a parody of Alan Moore's original graphic novel. In this series say goodbye to the dark, deep psychological character development of the graphic novel and, instead, say hello to a mess, bad written parody of Moore legacy.<br/><br/>Even Snyder film feels more authentic and respectful to the original material. Lindelof doesn't have any idea about TV writing at all. Lazy writing, yet has more dialogue than action.
The police wear masks and commit murder.
-Protagonists?
'Kill all the evil white guys' = plot This shows biggest fault was how boring it was.<br/><br/>Both Batwoman and "Watchman" contain heavy handed political messaging. Yet despite the cheapness of Batwoman it does have that ironic so bad it's good quality. It's plots; so far, have been so dumb they somehow manage to be unpredictable at times. And i find myself wondering if Neil Breen was a producer.<br/><br/>The watchman was boring and i genuinely cannot remember the names of any characters. I will end with some of the questions i was left with.
Why do the cops wear masks?
Why do they have to ask permission to pull their guns?
When was Rorschach a white supremist?
Why does the main woman have children that aren't hers?
Why does she pretend to be a retired cop but hangs with the cowboy cop that doesn't wear a mask?
Also what the hell was that scene with Jeremy Irons even about? So confusing. Maybe if it were not watchmen it would be better... I'm a big fan of Watchmen and I watched the movie it was much better .. why did you change everything? I'm so angry waited for several months and I don't see much of content related to the comic book or the movie, It's represent racial fight story, So you will get my middle finger that represents my rate of this series. At first I stopped watching at around 7 minutes into the first episode thinking I'm fairly sure what will be served up. Being a glutton for punishment and based on the trailer it seemed to warrant a second look. Wow! Made it through the second episode and the only word that came to mind besides silly and ridiculous was absurd. Who comes up with the stuff? Now I have to watch the 2009 Watchmen movie to see if it's the same kind of chitlins. I'm not sure why the Triple K, the militant creation of the Democrats after the Civil War, is being revived in episode 1 as the racist bad guys, but it's difficult to understand Hollywood, these days.<br/><br/>Nothing like the movie, and nothing like the graphic novels I enjoy.<br/><br/>*Not* "Watchmen"! First of all, I really looked forward to watching this show and waited a few weeks to see it. I read some of the reviews and was apprehensive but still watched. I have seen the the movie like 5 times and read the comic a few times, I really liked it, a lot and would rate it a 9. But this, not even a 1. Like most people said, it's nothing like the movie, not even close and it's the most racist program on TV right now, I mean it's really in your face and if you can't see that you're beyond help.<br/><br/>Second, yes, I did watch the first show but barely got through the second one, it was all over the place and stuff just didn't add up, at all.<br/><br/>Third, I'm cancelling my script to HBO if this is the crap they are going to be putting out, I'm done!<br/><br/>Finally, The positive reviews on here must be bots or paid reviewers, the is no way this thing should even get more than a 1, and that's pushing it. Unfortunately this is the stuff that going to be put out and it won't get better in our lifetime, so start reading books while you still can. In the description it says stays true to the original while "attempting" to break new ground. The so called attempt failed. Please stop paying Damon Lindelof anything. I should have known better after the Lost fiasco. Viewers don't forget buddy. 6 years I will never get back, I'm not about to give you any more years. Not sure what's going on with this series. No, I didn't read the original, but a series should stand on its own without having to know the original source material. Confusing, but visually appealing. Pandering and divisive racial narrative garbage. More fuel for the burgeoning grievance industry. Super disappointing. One and done. The audio is so messed up that I have to change the volume from scene to scene. That's it for the technical complaints.<br/><br/>The alternate reality concept is compelling, but then you get a heavy dose of toxic neo-marxist propaganda. It is all so contrived and blatant with the narrative it is attempting to construct.<br/><br/>Deeply disappointing. I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes, the whole thing doesn't make any sense. Pushing the whole racial war crap is exactly how you embolden racism. Not interested. Please dont use a great story that the people love and try to twist it. Into your vile narrative to create divide in modern society! We're too smart for that crap. This thing is nothing to do with watchmen One of the brilliant abilities of HBOs storytelling is that viewer is left to interpret, learn, and question their internal belief systems when presented with the story. Moral dilemmas, family betrayals, the quest to become better, evil verses good, empathy for the villians.... the list is endless. Not in this case. Let's take a blatant race politics from modern day headlines and recreate it smack dab right in the middle of this story. The storyline is tired and can be seen on every network, cable channel, streaming channel, soap opera, nightly newscast, and premium channel out there. If anything, it closed my mind, it didnt open it. Way to go.HBO. ITS SO BAD, I am not even going to give it another shot this Sunday and have deleted it fro. My DVR. I look forward to Showtime with Shameless, Ray Donovan, and Homeland, and I would rather catch up on the last 2years of the walking dead than continue to watch this non escapist garbage. All today shows are influenced by liberal brainwash propaganda, but newer before until now has any started as one. So in basics, if you are rebel of political party, if you are group like anonymous, if you question liberals, if you are white, then you are a bad person now... This show is an afront to the Watchmen. I'm a huge comic book fan. Watchmen is one of my favorites. I remember when it was first announced we were told by HBO that it was not the Watchmen we wanted but the Watchmen we deserved. That was such a lie! It's nothing I'm interested in. I've watched my first and last episode. Actually I watched as mych as I ciuld stomach. I don't know why I lost one hour of my life watching an episode from a series. I was out of my mind I guess. This production is so childish and messy that I couldn't make it to the end of the first episode. Nothing makes sense, nothing means anything in relation to anything else, there is no plot or substance to the story or the characters in the story. It's a dumbed-down action flick for a strictly adolescent audience. Hasn't HBO got any original material better than this popcorn stuff? This show is incoherent. I don't know who characters are or what they are trying to accomplish. I recently watched the Zack Snyder movie which is very faithful to the graphic novel and is also very entertaining and well done. This show has nothing going for it but the title. Alan Moore can not be pleased with this "adaptation"
of his classic work. Damon Lindelof is proving to be a genuine hack. The Hunt may be his best work and it was cancelled before it was released to theaters. Let's pretend this has nothing to do with Watchmen. Let's pretend we haven't seen 2009 movie or we dont know anything about the name "Alan Moore".<br/><br/>Still this is a really bad show. Really bad characters, unfortunately very bad actors (or it seems they have no clue what the director or screenwriter wants from them), very cliche & really banal plot.<br/><br/>Overall, a total failure. Hope people who are involved into thiss mess give it up early. Watchmen killed by this political show! Terrible to see how such a good story and character as seen in the movie can be destroyed by a political show. This has nothing in comment to the movie. I really looked forward to this show but I stop looking after the first episode. I don't know The Watchmen other than the movie from last decade.
The movie was a head scratcher as it was more about ideas than actual plot, characters or anything that usually makes A movie.
--
Anyhow, I barely remember the movie because I felt it was worth forgetting, yet I think it would help me to understand this show at least a little.
Currently without knowledge of backstory, this show is 10000% terrible to an epic degree.
My opinion has nothing to do with racial anything. The show should have started with an episode to "on board" everyone who has no idea what this insane acid trip mixed with reality AND A BAJILLION PLOTS HOLES, is actually about or what is happening or why it is happening. So much is pointless. pointless, pointless, pointless, pointless, pointless.
--
There are articles out there blaming trolls for being "uncomfortable" about racial aspects in the show as so they can try to defend the show from bad ratings... but NOPE, the show is just lame. Sorry to the PR money spent on trying to save the show's reputation by insulting normal people by calling them closet racists but the show is just ultra bad terrible pointless. Bad reviews happen, if you don't want bad reviews then maybe do better and also maybe not pay people to write articles that insult the people providing their opinion as feedback. 
THE SHOW IS SIMPLY LAME AND I AM NOT AN "UNCOMFORTABLE TROLL". --HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU ALL. I'm sorry - I have NO idea why this series is titled such as it's has nothing in common with the actual movie. Like the other negative posts, there are SO many things THROWN in at once in Pilot episode - some that make sense, some that make no sense, etc. I enjoy the main actress in other series and for once she is the main character. But this episode SUCKED so badly I can't even fathom watching another episode. I love it when people say "watch the 1st several episodes and it'll get better" mentality - I think the 1st episdoe should tell me if the series is worth watching. Sorry - I don't mean to be so negative but this is by far the worst pilot series I've watched - and I watch A LOT of shows Just another piece full of lefitist brainwash. In this kind of mind-confusion elaboration people are categorized and divided based on color, sex, and other material characteristic. Usually the gay and black people are better or the best individuals, attempting to do good and right, which is made difficut or impossible by white or heterosexual intolerant persons, All other real life aspects are irrelevant, and revenge against the ideal enemy (usualy the other race, color and etiny, ...) is necessary and justfied. All problems and dificulties a person has in life is due and only due for its race, color, sex, sex preferences and other stupid distinction and differentiation, The basic belief is that there is no fairness or justice in the word to reward intention, effort and dedication if you are not white and heterosexual. It seems they simply took characters from the Watchmen graphic novels / movie and inserted them into a race based political narrative. This is not a continuation of previous storyline or nature of characters.<br/><br/>This has been a current trend. The critics will praise it, audience will give it poor reviews and will be dubbed "trolls" for disliking it.<br/><br/>The performances and production seem all around pretty good. I personally couldn't get past how badly they high jacked original story and characters. Garbage. Complete garbage. Giving 1 star for presentation - it is shot alright, has a good score track. Farm shootout was entertaining and effects are good.
2nd star for Don Johnson and Jeremy Irons - it's always nice to see them on the screen. They are actors who can elevate the material. Sadly material here is current year SJW politics, no mater how good of an actor you are - you cant make this watchable. Outside the SJW premise, I could care less a good show is a good show. This isn't. Acting is just terrible, and there is no relation to the comic or movie. When the original writer says it's crap, probably crap. But if you hate it you are either racist or it's to nuance for our little brains.<br/><br/>I gave it two episodes and I want to sue HBO for making my eyes bleed. This doesnt follow any comics or real plot lines from the movies. I gave it 2 stars because of the the production quality, but the writing in this is terrible. You enjoy these characters and comics to escape reality, not plaster reality in a twisted way in front of us. Absolutely spits on everything the original watchmen stood for. This show reminded me of the Leftovers HBO show in that it was odd and awkward. You end the first episode wondering what you just watched, not remembering anyone's name and wanting your 60 minutes back. Some of the positive reviews on here are so hilarious while at the same time confounding. It's almost as if we watched a different show. Good thing I know nothing about the comic book story because judging by comments on here I would have given it only half a star... I guess the new thing these days is to take the rights to a much hallowed property, and then remake or "expand" the universe with half-assed characters and tired storylines. Other than a few silly references, this is definitely not the Watchmen. Yet another installment of a TV series that picks on the enemy du jour, in this case white supremacists, in order to bump up it's ratings.  A very cheap ploy. Of course that then brings along a myriad of "fans" who will defend it against all criticism.<br/><br/>I suppose the most obvious commentary about this is that Alan Moore has said he doesn't want his name associated with it. I can only assume that anyone rating this mess higher than a three has never read anything by Alan Moore. I'll make it short. This was the most politically charged show I've watched in forever. I thought the new Twilight Zone was ridiculous, but this takes the cake. Talk about trying to divide us more. The bad guys are all white men who wear white masks, while the main hero's are a strong black female and...a communist. You couldn't write a more left leaning show if you tried. Sorry but a middle aged woman is not going to be cutting it for a bad protagonist. Rod Tidwell's wife suddenly is this elite detective? Another woke agenda piece. Middle aged women would get overpower by most teenage boys. This is your main hero?<br/><br/>Skip this liberal mouthpiece and save your time. Has nothing in common with the original Watchmen. This has very limited ties to any original Watchmen. In this they indicate the right (all of them) is fighting against the police. But in reality the left is the only side fighting law enforcement. Antif-whatever, BL-only their lives matter are the only ones fighting against any form of law enforcement. As they have always done, the fake media, Hollywood is spinning things the direction THEY want you to believe. But aren't the Hollywood elite being arrested and exposed daily? This is just Hollywood propaganda! Like it or not, the truth is the truth, and not a political affiliation. Thought this would be a good show considering the actors involved, turns out not. Like we really needed a fictional racist world to stir up more division in society. Such a shame. Especially infuriating considering they use a REAL racial riot and intermix Real events into this absurd fictional world so as to confuse those who might casually follow to believe that this extremism could really happen today. Ita so boring I couldn't even finish the first episode Seemed interesting at first, but really fell flat throughout the episode.
It seems I'm not the only one in this review section who's confused by this strange adaptation.
Guess I'll give it a go for a couple of more episodes ... The action was good, the acting was good. The cinematography was good. Loved her outfit. Why did I hate it? Well it jumped all over in time, with little explanation of the alt universe. The background was unclear. Characters were one dimensional and I was not invested enough to care. I did not like the pacing. Excruciatingly slow at times and super fast at others. So fast information came at you like rapid auto fire. The music was absolutely AWFUL! Mismatched to the scenes and actually jarringly distracting. Lastly, there is already lots of ugly hatred in the world. I can watch it on you tube. I watch comic book inspired shows because they are over the top fantasies with over the top bad guys and an escape. When I want to watch an uncomfortable treatise on hatred - I watch the news. For the record, I am a left centrist, and cannot stand trump. So don't go there. And what's up with the SQUID??!! Because, well, I was holding out that perhaps they would honor the spirit of the Watchmen series. But... No. And gauging from some of the other reviews, I am not the only one who saw right through what they did.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, they crapped all over the Watchmen. First they really did not have to virtually carbon copy everything about the movie, never mind the comic series. Second, was it really that necessary to inject such racial divides, racial over/under-tones? No, methinks that was completely unnecessary and over the top.<br/><br/>Pretty much carbon copied the movie virtually to a scene, even brought out Archie, briefly, before they had it take a nose dive into the ground.<br/><br/>Maybe Don Johnson would have had a more prominent role? But no, even that they got wrong.<br/><br/>Maybe it gets better, they explain some things, but I really doubt it at this point. It's a story that has a kind of implausible comic book character, but without any real style, humor or anything engaging.<br/><br/>The plotting is jumbled, the acting is average at best, and it's stuffed full of tired tacky left wing politics.<br/><br/>I just felt generally meh about it. It just struck me as someone's personal messaging wrapped in a face mask. And not in a good way. It's not bad it's just sooo, booring. :). Stopped watching after one and a half episodes.<br/><br/>No watchmen characters, just other new characters. Perhaps a week reference to Doctor Manhattan. It doesn't feel watchmen, this is a totally different thing. Not for me at all, hopefully someone likes it. :) I truly loved the movie and comics. This is as far removed from those as possible... and even more apparent it's moved to the Left. Don't waste your time. Re-watch the original movie instead So I was hoping for a series actually related to the comics but obviously I was wrong. This is just another example of lazy American TV shoving politically correct messages in your face instead of a decent story. I doubt I'll get beyond episode 2. I really wanted to like it. I'm all about thought provoking shows, and ideas that challenge society. This show feels like it completely missed the entire point of the original graphic novel. The original Watchmen focused on many different political issues that gave it a larger over arching narrative on society. That's absolutely not what this show does. It's way too on the nose and comes off more like pandering to very specific demographic rather then talking about society as a whole and how all of the systems in it are broken and apart of the problem. It felt disjointed. Story elements make no sense. Characters make decisions that make no sense. Things that should easily be explained to progress the story left the myself and people who I watched this with more confused then engaged. It feels like it takes elements of the original story and misrepresents and misuses them. I'm a huge fan of the Watchmen comic-book and I loved the movie when it came out, so I think it should go without saying that I was excited when Iearned that they were working on a series.<br/><br/>I should have known better. This has nothing to do with the actual comics and changed the entire storyline. My question is why would you alienate the Watchmen fanbase by creating something that has no connection with it? Was it just to make a few bucks by using the name?<br/><br/>Don't tell me that you're gonna give me a burger and then when I order it you serve me a pizza. I came for the Watchmen and got something different, and to top it all off, it's not even good. Was really looking forward to this as the trailer looked interesting but after about 10 minutes I got so confused that I really don't think I will be watching the rest of this And it's garbage. The lighting is very good, but the overall acting, the script is a newfound level of cringe.
Nope, garbage about sums it up. After watching this first episode,, this is of no interest to me. I am not watching a show about race for 10 hours. I have Fox news and CNN for that. I watch TV shows to be entertained. I watch documentaries to be educated. I am not saying it's not good, I am saying it's of zero interest to me. Other than good hologram special effects in the Ances-Tree building, there is absolutely nothing going on that holds my attention. The overall racism plot is intriguing but it's been executed absolutely terribly. No characterisation, no warmth, no charm and no appeal to casual viewer. I don't care about any of the characters so I asked myself why am I watching this? It's just wasting my time.<br/><br/>Who is this show trying to appeal to? Comic book fans? They hate it cos it's nothing like the original. Perhaps it's for casual viewers like me? Well I just find this story has a plodding plot full of pointless waffle set in a weird world with people with no superpowers fighting & beating up people twice their size. Similar to Agent Carter and look what happened to that show.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good current comic book series then watch Daredevil or Jessica Jones. Absolute rubbish, more political crap forced down your throat. Who green lights this nonsense. If your going to make a tv show out of watchmen at least make it as good or better than the film. Feels like they've sat there with a check list while making this black lead, make her a women too they'll love that, oh who can we oppress mmmm what about some police bashing with violence towards civilians. More Pc snowflake crap and sister nights actress and character as the main hero of the piece not believable you can't relate to her you don't care about the characters because your yawning and wondering why and how could they screw this up anymore. I'm only reviewing the first episode and having previously watched the film and read the graphic novel I found this new production pretty confusing.
Sadly it seems obsessed with race & police hatred and appears to be a parody of the angst and divisions of the United States. For this reason, a show like this doesn't fit with a UK or European audience.
I didn't like it but I will at least watch the 2nd episode and probably read the graphic novel again. My new must watch......... Don Johnson as the Police Commander, he even sings in Episode 1......So many bad reviews on here as another interviewer has said, the show is doing something right if the Right is scared and posting terrible reviews, I'm 69 and loved the first episode....... Nothing like the movie but that's fine, this show will create a new legacy Exactly what I was hoping for, I love Damon Lindelof's projects and this is so well written! Watchmen movies and comics are among my favorite things, so I have been waiting for this show all year. I'm very intrigued for more chaos and phenomenal cinematography! Don't trust anyone that complains about propaganda, that's exactly how the movie was, like with The Comedian fighting off riots and anything similar, this is meant to be based off the comics and it's done so damn well in every aspect of that. Horribly unlikable characters. Uninteresting world. And made for only one reason, race baiting. I don't get why stuff like that get green lit, let alone shoot a full season. It promotes division and racism. It doesn't help anyone. I love Watchmen. I loved how in the original Watchmen, possible nuclear holocaust loomed in the background of every scene. The distrust that nations had for each other drove the plot forward. Here, there is no possible nuclear holocaust. Instead of having the shows main problem be avoiding nukes, it is now about avoiding racism. It paints America as the racist country that all the liberals think they're already living in. Meanwhile, despite phenomenal acting and a fantastic budget, the show reads like Elizabeth Warren's talking points in the Democratic debates. I didn't think it was possible, but you ruined Watchmen for me. Thanks a lot. If you're expecting to see an in-depth adaptation of Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbons' groundbreaking graphic novel, prepare to be disappointed.
On the other hand, if you're hoping to see a well-written, thought-provoking series, with an enthralling narrative arc, and which takes the spirit of the graphic novel and turns it into something equally groundbreaking, prepare to be disappointed. Really just an odd and uninteresting show. You have a clear anti-white theme in the show which is very odd. It feels like it has been written by a very bitter twisted person who has had a difficult life and therefore wants to bring everyone over to their very twisted way of viewing the world.<br/><br/>Personally I have not enjoyed this and will not be watching it anymore. Its a shame when you see so much money being thrown at a show which really doesn't have much substance. A total mess from start to finish. episode 1, apart from the opening scenes, was disjointed, hard to follow and a waste of my time. i have no experience with The Watchmen in any form...previous movies, comic books, etc. and after enduring this, this...mess, i din't care to. avoid this show like the plague. I found that the action scenes were terrible, the characters unlikeable, and the bad guys were absolutely nameless and faceless.<br/><br/>Watchmen should blur the good/bad lines and make you think. This does not. Wow. If you liked this tv show, please name one that you didn't. I bet you can't.<br/><br/>Terrible. Ruins much of the original story and characters. Hopefully there will be no more. Normally a series' first episode's job is to hook you. Watchmen does the exact opposite by alienating you with designs and ideas so different from the source material. I don't blame the people in the other reviews for giving up after the first episode (which is by far the worst). I stuck around week after week hoping that the next episode would be THE ONE, but each time I was left disappointed.<br/><br/>Plot
<ul><li>The original Watchmen was about the non-heroics of costumed heroes, impending doom and war deterrence. Watchmen 2019 is about race. Until it's not anymore. Until that idea just becomes a minor favor for a character. Then it's about an unconvincing love story.</li><li>They explain away some weird decisions by saying that for Dr Manhattan they have already happened, so why not just facilitate them. That is a paradox in itself, and it would be fine if said decisions were written well, but that is not the case. They rely on this a lot, unfortunately.</li><li>Plot points are started, but then abandoned (Lube Man, the Abar children, the hunt for the Kavalry, police wearing masks).</li><li>You can remove certain factions and characters from the plot (7th Kavalry, Police, Will, Looking Glass, Laurie, Veidt) and the story would be just the same.</li></ul><br/><br/>Design
<ul><li>Costumes are awful, basically something you can pull out of a closet.</li><li>Makeup is awful - Dr. Manhattan does not feel larger than life. He is just a man painted blue.</li><li>Ozymandias costume looks good, but it's treated like a joke.</li></ul><br/><br/>Characters
<ul><li>I don't understand how Dr Manhattan can just decide that he's fallen in love with random, unremarkable Angela Abar. There has to be a lot of suspension of disbelief for just this plot thread to hold. Yahya Abdul Mateen, while a good actor (loved him in The Get Down) was not a convincing Dr. Manhattan, and that is most obvious when they try to have him do exposition. And they do that often. He comes off more like a wimpy Teal'c from SG1.</li><li>Ozymandias is horribly mischaracterized. At the end of the Watchmen comic he himself started doubting his own plan and needed reassurance from Jon to justify his guilt. This is not a continuation of that, but instead, he is cocky, excentric, erratic and un-remorseful. A far cry from the soft spoken, well mannered smartest man. He wants recognition. Laurie decides to arrest him, undoing everything he strived for at the culmination of the comic, which felt like a huge slap. Ultimately, it was amusing to watch his antics for a time.</li><li>Lady Trieu is a pretty bad character. A thirft store Ozymandias. A perversion of the Mary Sue. I don't know what is worse - having the 7th Kavalry as the villain or having her take over with essentially the same plan.</li><li>Most other characters are not only unlikable, but completely useless: Laurie, Looking Glass, Red Scare, Pirate Jenny. Having some of them get their own episodes was a waste of airtime.</li></ul><br/><br/>Sound
<ul><li>I do like the soundtrack from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, however I don't think the electro synth fits the atmosphere.</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion
<ul><li>It's a mess of ideas that doesn't come close to the source material. Don't waste your time, unless you're really bored and have nothing else to watch. Watch the Watchmen motion comic instead. Or heck even the Snyder movie.</li></ul> WTH was that?! This is one of the most racist series I've ever seen! How is no one calling Damon Lindelof out on this?! The failed creator/writer of "LOST" returns with this racist trash?! Racism is wrong regardless of the race involved. This series and the HBO network that broadcasts it should be boycotted. This type of show has no place in today's world. And no, you don't get to hide behind the excuse of different time periods, alternate realities, or other convenient plot mechanism - Damon is just the worst. (Nailed it! Cancelled after one season!) If you read the comic or watched the movie you're probably not going to like this, this is so loosely based on the comic that it's basically just the name, I myself had a hard time getting in to it, and even for a show that I knew nothing about, I still would take a pass on this I've not read the comic books, so for me this was just a stinky mess that made absolutely no sense and above all, was very boring. I only watched the first episode and it was enough for me. I'm out. This show will only have one season. The writers seriously messed up, the casters, well it's easy to see they messed up on their job too. Essentially this fall, CW and HBO are battling to be more woke than the other, and the Batman Comics Universe and the Watchmen CU get tainted by it. Temporarily though at least, which is very good thing. It's a shame we waited all this long so we get this disappointing version of Watchmen!
It gives no right to the comics nor to the previous installment.
Storyline is weak, the action is boring, the cinematography is messed up and a very poor choice of actors.
Cancel this show before they ruin it more for us The now confirmed Veidt is kind of disturbing. With the human clones it sets up an easy excuse anytime the writers want they can have a person be a clone.<br/><br/>This is kind of the same problem watching Westworld has become. The synthetics can be rebirthed anytime, thus their spectacular deaths mean nothing.<br/><br/>Everytime you think a character is gone for good...boom there they are again.<br/><br/>Veidt is trying to create his own Dr Manhattan assuming that once he does, he'll be able to control it. Veidt killed millions to save billions, but he didn't act like his current incarnation.<br/><br/>All this gets me wondering how many of these characters are Veidt creations he's placed around to do his little dramas with? The clones all act normal until Veidt tells them to do something and without hesitation they do.<br/><br/>Any of the people we've seen so far die could have been his people. Obviously somebody is manipulating everything to create a division in society. I'm hoping its not Veidt. That just turns all this into an orchestrated drama. And We're all the puppets. I even suspect Veidts adversary is simply a creation of his, because he wants an adversary. That's actually the same thing going on in Westworld! I saw the the movie "watchmen" and loved it and saw it 4 times and still think it was a brilliant film. When I heard HBO was making a series, I was excited to see how they were going to make that great film into a series. I just started watching this show and into the 4th episode and even though the production and look of the show is top notch but I also feel its incoherent and very over rated to get 8 on IMDB?. I read a lot of the reviews here and I can see is from one extreme to another; either people gave it a high rating as 10 or low as 3 but that tells me a lot about how polarized it is as how people either hate Trump or they don't.<br/><br/>I am aware this series has nothing to do with the movie "Watchmen" but my biggest problem when I started to watch this show was with some of the casting, starting with "Regina Bell" whom I loved in other shows like "Southland" but she is a total mistake and miscast in this role, as this dark caped crusader law enforcement at her age? How pathetic she even looks in that outfit with her Fat ass hanging and its just sad to watch. This is the problem with actors in Hollywood today; its their EGO that blinds them, they get a few awards and they think they can pick what ever role they want. This role is just way out of Regina Bell's element and many women may read this and disagree but this another problem again that every show now pushes the Pseudo-Feminist agenda in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Regina Bella even said that herself at the Golden Globe that she wants to produce shows that women are the lead character, so take a look around almost every major film and movie has a female leads even more than men today. You have another cast member "Jean Smart" who is 69 years going 45 and with all the plastic surgery and Botox her face is like pasted with make up and just looks hideous and she is suppose this tough ass cop, please give us a brake?. Where does this none-sense end?. I am not trying to be a male chauvinist towards women, but this Pseudo-Feminist agenda in Hollywood films for women to be portrayed they have to kick-ass and act tough is actually making them look stupid, it does not gain them respect. In Europe female have equal rights, and they find women in American movies who walk and talk abrasive, rude, and tough as a cartoon characters and not real and this is what these kind of roles create. Why is in our country Pseudo-Feminist agenda is defined as "being tough" not as intelligence and elegance and strong minded person?<br/><br/>The story of this show is so focused on racism and stirs the pot and hate from the first episode. Its not even objective, that Black people are always the victim? It's also very incoherent at times; where the scenes jumps from one place and time to another and who ever Jeremy Iron's character is suppose on that big castle and duplicate servants";; in four episodes you are still asking yourself WTF am i watching here? who is this guy and how is he related to the rest of the story?. Then you got all these weird tv shows with superheros and that even makes no sense as how its all related to the narrative line?<br/><br/>I guess shows like these as bad as they are survive and go on longer seasons but shows that invoke more thought than action get tossed aside. The only reason this show is getting high rating is the production value on the fighting and killing scenes, if it was anything like the 2009 film that required thinking, it would not one season. So congrats HBO you reached the Dummy down millennial generation who the concept of thought and depth is a huge task for them. It's time to put woke asleep.<br/><br/>"Can everyone say plagiarism?"<br/><br/>Sure, I knew you could.<br/><br/>"How about creator rights?"<br/><br/>Nope... I knew you couldn't.
Does no-one care about rights? Not even the arrogantly, hypocritically, tiresome woke?<br/><br/>Ask Hollywood, HBO and Damon Lindelof what sells?
And the answer is... anything containing woke hypocrisy, and the inability to actually think and create.<br/><br/>No thanks!
I'd rather read an authentic and unique story by Alan Moore, and look at spectacular drawings by Dave Gibbons. Ok so it's done well. Ok acting's done well also. But look it is not the watchmen. And why do we always have to make everything about racism, sexism, etc etc. Why can't we just do a show (especially one based on a comic book) where we can just switch off from the world and enjoy it. Why do we need to continue with this in everything we watch now.<br/><br/>Won't be going passed episode 3. Rubbish. I am not left wing or right wing or any wing. I believe in peace and equality for all. The fact that we have to fight for anything like that is beyond me. BUT TV shows are an escape from the harshness of the real world and this show does not grant that to you. It actually gets you further involved and drops its very violent views on you right away. This is way too much for me! I wanted to approach if with a fresh mindset, but it's nothing but peachy over-opinionated propaganda. The opening was very strong and then it began to become more about social criticism. I understand watchmen source material is very political, but that's a far cry from ending wars than just speaking upon every injustice. What an epic failure of a chance. Maybe (more like hopefully) this show gets better. But this first episode was, to be kind, not good. Very little about it was memorable - it was visually impressive (which is not that surprising these days), with good music, and a poorly strung together storyline. Worst, it seemed to try to borrow from the superb Fargo (Season 2) with the intro. HBO generally produces high quality fare, but this mess seems to miss the mark. Abit of a confused mess but has decent costumes and effects. Will probably annoy you if you know the comics as the natural progression of characters ideals seem ignorant at best however this is definitely not a poorly made show...it may have potential but for now it's got something to prove.<br/><br/>For those giving it a 1/10 because wokeness don't be silly the shows budget and cinematography render it 5/10 atleast<br/><br/>For those giving it a 10/10 because wokeness don't be silly. A 10 is reserved for near perfection and this show is not that even from episode one there appears to be some storytelling problems furthermore the ideas the show expresses appear to be very black and white this does not work in watchmen as the entire universe is founded on gray morality thus a 10 is undeserving<br/><br/>Score 6.8/10 rounded to 7 Boring, with a nonsense story line and frankly one of the worst new shows of 2019. I've rated nearly 4,000 shows and movies on IMDB, and am totally put off by people who have to rate a 1 or a 10.<br/><br/>This show is a genuine 10. Like Back to the Future (1985) it is perfectly conceived, perfectly written, perfectly acted, and perfectly directed. It creates a mystery but then the mystery is solved in a way that's free from deus ex machina, unlikely coincidences.<br/><br/>Although it's a new story, it fits thematically with the original. Ignore the reviews saying that it's too "woke". Frankly, I think some people just can't handle African-American history. Keep in mind that people on IMDB write reviews from all over the world. The haters don't necessarily represent Americans. They're the kind of people who twist themselves into knots if Batman were remade with a black man, and no, it's not literary purity that's driving that.<br/><br/>Unlike the powerful imagery of Twin Peaks and Lost, which promised much but ultimately had no answers, this series is going somewhere. Try it. I wanted to like this but I cant and just typical of modern writing. There is no need to use the Title Watchmen and character names from the comic book. This is going to bomb as trying to trick viewers into something to get over a certain point of view never works The title says it all. I have no sympathy for the rightwing that this is so ovbviously trying to make a point towards but the terrible forced divirsity and flippes role concept. Feels completely fake a is in my view a extremely lazy way to try to make a point.<br/><br/>Everything in this is honestly garbage, completely unbelieveble universe, bad characters, overuse of dramatic music and bad story.<br/><br/>Makes no sense to me how any one can enjoy this. All of the good reviews mention race, politics, and generic praise claiming its perfect. all of the bad reviews comment on the actual show and specific things they didnt like about it. Almost all of the good reviews claim that the bad reviews are just upset special snowflakes complaining about race and politics. Hmm... Not Watchmen. Geared towards rubbish, more political correct garbage. Thats all i can say about this. Is it too much to ask just to be entertained. Why does literally everything being spewed out of the entertainment industry have to be about these themes? It's tiring and not entertaining.<br/><br/>Besides if you want to change social and political opinions sodomizing these works of fiction isn't the way to do it. They just aren't convincing anyone. Only morons would be influenced by comic book movies.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs to understand that no one is buying this crap. These attempts to sell it are awkward and obvious. *spoilers, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled*<br/><br/>So, I will cut it short. Dr. Manhattan has been in love with Silk Spectre and he always says, how he is present in multiple times at once. But funnily enough, nothing about Silk Spectre, he just suddenly decides he is in love with Angela Abar and apparently has been forever.<br/><br/>Then at the end, Veidt, the absolute genius and smartest person on earth comes up with the idea of dropping frozen sea food to save the planet. Did I forget to mention that the password of Veidts sperm bank (keep in mind he is the smartest person on earth) is not only just 1 password (no additional security? No Multifactor Authentification?), it is simply "Ramesses II".<br/><br/>Regarding dropping frozen sea food, the frozen squids can cut through the metal of Trieus machine as well as her hand like it's nothing, but not through buildings, police cars thin roofs or Angelas tiny metal cover she holds up to run through the droppings and it's not even hurting her hand while she holds it up.<br/><br/>*Spoilers end*<br/><br/>The writing and story is simply atrocious. It had good promise, but totally falls apart during the second half of the season. Also, the season could have been cut to 6 episodes. There are way too many fillers to stretch the season. Up to Episode 3... I hope this gets better and picks up soon or I'm just not going to make it to the end of the season. Shame too, Regina King deserves better! Just forgetabble dribble. Do not waste your time. Go watch Carnival Row ( entertainement ) or Main in the High Castle (if you want alernative history) . I do not know the purpose of this show. If you want politics watch CNN, Fox or CNBC much more entertaining. Don't be fooled by the good reviews. I gave the first episode a chance but after watching the second episode I decided that this show is not for me or anybody who likes Watchmen. This show is nothing like the source material and is completely dry. Plus, it fails at being dark and weird so don't be fooled if that's what you're looking for. What have they done with our show, people? It depresses me, as a true Watchmen fan, to know that this is what they thought would be an "improvement." Superheros and comics in general are supposed to be about good versus evil; now everything has to be about black and white. To be fair, I am writing this into the 3rd episode, so things may turn around, though I doubt it. The new superheros are lame; the combat is lukewarm and minimal; squids falling from the sky is a laughable concept; and the political undertones of the overall plot comes off as excessively preachy. It's an insult to Alan Moore, but most especially to Watchmen fans. Whoever signed off on calling this show watchmen clearly knew no one would watch it if they didn't. even though its got nothing to do with watchmen I winced so hard watching the two episodes currently out I can now clench my face into a fist. if your going to go entirely off tangent just call it something else. Crap. Got NOTHING to do with Watchmen. Skip this one if you like Watchmen.. We wanted Rorschach, Night Owl, Silk Spectre and the Comedian. Got this?! No. Just no. You do realize EVERYONE used to watch your shows right? Now you're making ideological propaganda. You used to make shows that showed things from all sides of life. Now you bring us this.... not to mention Jon Oliver, Bill Maher, and Pod Save America. You could resurrect yourself and go back to an open moderate format of shows and movies, The majority of people would enjoy that. But if you're going to take a show about fighting communist evil and turn it into left wing propaganda, you're destined to fail. I really hope by watching the first episode, HBO doesn't think I'm interested in the slightest bit. This is garbage, and I don't understand how this show is even being called 'watchmen'. Cheap money grab on the name recognition. Regardless of whether or not you have read the "graphic novel" or have seen the movie, regardless if you are American or not, regardless of what color your skin is, left, right, or inside-out, I can pretty much guarantee the pilot will put a really bad taste in your mouth within the first couple minutes, and it will stay there rotting and just getting more putrified til the end, leaving you angry at yourself for wasting your time.<br/><br/>Cinematically, it's ok. None of the acting was bad. Regardless of the cast or crew, I can't afford to give it more than the lowest scare and a question- What the hell were the actors thinking when they signed on to perform in this circus side-show?<br/><br/>Terrible disappointment. I found the first two episodes confusing and could not get to grips with the story line
I think they've tried to hard and ruined it.
Poor. I won't watch anymore because I don't want to waste my time. Why do these people keep ruining everything?!
if you took out the sjw crap this would actually not be bad but as it stands it is a great window into how the left imagines the world to be Nothing like comic book or film......... Was expecting so much more I couldn't stomach the first episode to the end.
Somehow more hateful than the news towards white people and their ability to lead in spite of the obvious proof: you've never given us the chance.<br/><br/>I just went back and rewatched the super long cut version of the film. My time was better spent doing that than trying to watch a second episode.
The clock has clearly, already struck midnight. Now we somehow are expecting there to still be a 12:01... except all we see is the past 20 years on repeat and we're just not suppose to notice. I am fan of original book and Snyder movie. Read it and watched it a lot of times and advise to do the same to everyone. I am finished to watch the show and tried to be open minded as possible about it. This is my first review and I am watching movies and tv shows of any genre for a 25 years, usualy I stay silent but I have a feeling I should say something this time.
First episode was not interesting at all, I was not hooked but watch it further cause of Watchmen title in it. And after that I've expereinced a lot of mixed emotions. Sometimes its not Watchmen at all. Sometimes you wanna say "Yes, this is it, real sequel". Sometimes its damn smart and interesting. Sometimes its weird in a bad way. It has plenty WTF moments which will never be explained, some of them will.
So why I am so frustated and rate it one? Cause maybe original book was weird and has wtf moments too, but it was never stupid. Last episode of the show is total BS. Stupid actions, stupid decisions, plot holes, story becames predictable and I could say a lot more but there's gonna be spoilers if I will. Truth is new Watchmen only tries to be the true sequel but decieve the audience and plays with all of us but in the end it became typical modern remake where all main characters are strong female and villains are stupid white males and nothing more.<br/><br/>If i step back a little bit and ignore the last episode. Mostly its very very very WHAT IF sequel. Cause all of the old heroes became their opposite. They completly out of character and it is never explained (only Oz maybe). Racist cult based on Rorshasch even in trailers was strange, but I was hoped Its gonna be explained somehow and its not. Rorshasch was never a racist only Oz think that way but he thinks same about Comedian too. Nationalist ? Maybe. But not a racist, there is a huge diffrence. This cult in a show a 100% racists like KKK. And stuff like that all over the show. Looks like showrunner wanted to create most unbelievable turn of events after the book and pursuit it.<br/><br/>So do I recommend it afterl all ? You can try if you fan like me, but I bet you ll be dissapointed. Ofcourse Its not deserve a 1 rating. Good acting, some parts of the story is good, direction is great too. But I just tired that most of the sequels just take a cult classic story and shape it with the modern trends. I expected more after a couple of episodes, but in the end it was just a waste of my time. And time is very precious. Tick-tock.<br/><br/>P.S If you never read a book or atleast watched a movie you not gonna understand a thing, but if somehow you're gonna manage through the story you may even like it, guess it depends of your tastes and life experience. The first episode was ...OK. Second and third are booooring. Jesus, they are boring...<br/><br/>Slow like molasses.
And there is never any excuse for that.
Even if they make sense of things in the end, it's just bad storytelling.
Half of the audience will have left. And justifiably so.<br/><br/>And why would you have faith that they WILL make sense of things, since they're already guilty of such poor storytelling...?<br/><br/>You're not supposed to wait for the point in a bored state.<br/><br/>I've watched three episodes, and so far, none of the characters are the least bit interesting.<br/><br/>I LOVED the movie. One of the very best movies, ever.
So it's only natural that it's hard for a series to live up to that.
But this is still just too low. Unforgivable. Haven't seen the film or read the comic books, but from the trailer Watchmen looked interesting.<br/><br/>Two episodes in; no thanks. Confusing plot & unlikable characters.<br/><br/>Seems like an opportunity missed. What is this? HBO need to stop, I am a big fan of the comics and the 2009 film. this series is just bs Who thought lundelof of all people should do watchmen? This is a burning  dumpster fire of a show. This isn't watchmen, it's wokemen but with the name of watchmen to get people to watch it. Your rating for this will rely entirely upon whether you share the view of the creators that white people are inherently an irredeemably evil.<br/><br/>More broadly it seemed to have little to do with the Watchmen comics readers will know and is merely appropriating the brand.<br/><br/>It is unlikely to make Alan Moore more irritable regarding his brainchild, but then again how could it? I love the source material and the film adaptation, but this bored me somewhat. Maybe it's because I'm British and didn't get the political nuances, but it's all a bit underwhelming nonetheless. Well, not wanting to be a hypocrite I hung in there until the bitter end. Of course since I did not like it I fully expect to be attacked as a "racist." Gee, how else can it be explained - right? Enough already! Get your heads out of your asses. Where I grew up we all thought for ourselves and diversity was considered a strength. What the hell happened? Now everyone seems to want a clone or a country full of lemmings. No thanks. Rating C- Really wanted to enjoy this show, i was excited to see a new watchmen adaptation come out but this... this is just dreadful. i don't know where these positive reviews are coming from as a 10/10 is far from what this show is deserving.
The characters are boring and tasteless, they bring nothing special to the table. the story is full of plot holes that literally don't make sense. feels as though a teenage girl has wrote this script and was forced to turn it into a show. Bad, really bad, even if you forget the premise. Its something new and its not good.
The twists are not well written and the whole story is dumb.
The whole white-supremacy-afroamerican-thing is boring for me.
Perhaps we here in Europe don't understand the whole thing..
My question:
What does an African American have to do with slavery in 2019?
Behause of the skin color he inherits a right to it?
it is ridiculous.<br/><br/>My opinion:
no one, no matter what skin color, has the right to refer to slavery in 2019. The colored victims of that time cannot be apologized and the white offenders cannot be punished. In 2019, no white or colored person has anything to do with slavery. It is ridiculous if someone refers to it and then uses the "we" or "you". Someone (or several someone's) got their drugs mixed up. Just watched the second episode. I was severely unimpressed by the first but the second found a new low level to drop to.... What ever the heck the plot is...I'm missing it! I have never been so disappointed in a series follow-up to a fantastic movie. I'm removing this DISASTER from my watchlist. I'll start watching the televised Impeachment Hearings instead. Oh wait, those are being conducted IN SECRET - NOBODY CAN WATCH THEM!!!!! The themes here are so very tired. Please stop with this narrative. I honestly have no idea why this is getting ANY good reviews - well, I do, but as far as storytelling goes, this is one of the more mediocre shows to air on HBO. But it's about race, and there are random reveals keeping it relevant on social media/Reddit, so people apparently feel the need to talk about it.<br/><br/>There isn't a protagonist, not really a compelling storyline, and lots of the show gets sidetracked to talk about race, race, race. Seems like Lindeloff found his new gimmick and it's apparently working, but this is a shame to see what he's done to the Watchmen property. Really sick and tired of the way the entertainment industry keeps destroying wonderful old franchises that used to entertain us and bring us together by trying to make them woke.<br/><br/>This is a hot mess that's only about the Watchmen titularly. A massive disappointment and a disgrace to the original frankly. Honestly, both are right to an extent. One thing I must give to the "anti SJW" folks is that this title has little to do with Watchmen beyond invoking name recognition to tell a completely unrelated story. If this show did not related itself to Watchmen, I would give more stars, because it was a cheap shot to use that trick.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the Watchmen lore, and I had to go some lengths to get my hands on the comics, being far from the scene at that time. Just like X-Men and Conan the Cimmerian, and Lovecraft books, they are works I read many times, I seek info about them, watch the shows and movies even if I am already prepared to dislike them. This one became one of the latter case.<br/><br/>I will not say it is a problem of political bias, because every movie or show can have a political bias if we look for one, and therefore, it is void of meaning to invoke it as a reason for saying it has this or that bias. I could say even Emojis has a strong political bias, and I could argue for that in thousands of ways. It is useless.<br/><br/>The problem with this show is that it invokes Watchmen, it does not expand on it, it does not build over it, and it does not recount on it. It is just placed there to tell a tale that could be told invoking any of the works I cited above as my favorites, and many others, and still have the same stale overall content, and it would work the same way.<br/><br/>You watch it, and you have nothing to look for, or to look forward. It is like a conversation in which you like the theme, but has nothing interesting about it, you either already know what is being said, or it is just common sense about it.<br/><br/>I dont need to invoke politics or the biased tone used lately by TV and cinema. It is just plain lazy writing over appealing clickbaity dialogue. What does this series has ANYTHING to do with watchmen AT ALL ? It's as far away from watchmen story as MCU is from GOT. That's right. Totally different. It is just a series with current racism/feminism politics with just the name "watchmen" given to it like Youtube clickbait video titles. A mess of unfocused storytelling, uninteresting mysteries for the sake of mysteries - and a total lack of character motivations and development, made up the most disappointing season of television i have watched in a long time.<br/><br/>Anyone hoping for a taste of Moore's unique blend of Ditko, Eisner and Lovecraft, (Or compelling storytelling of any kind) stay far away from this one.<br/><br/>Watch out 2003s 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' there is a new contender for worst Moore adaptation, in town. I'm a long time Watchmen fan and was really looking forward to this show. Unfortunately it has NOTHING to do with the Watchmen outside of the idea of masked vigilantes. If it was a good show I could forgive this, but it's not a good show Some people may rate this low because of the PC and preachy nature of it's racial theme, but I'm rating it low because it's BAD.<br/><br/>Cinematography and acting were OK, Music choices were terrible. The story dialogue and pacing were BORING. I was just so bored watching it that I barely made it through the first episode. I won't be watching more. What was HBO thinking? I knew within seconds that this show would get a bunch of low scores. IMDb-ratings nowadays don't go too high on any show that angers a highly sensitive crowd of politically driven people incapable of just relaxing. No matter acting, cinematography, production and feel. Things that this show definitely deliver.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a surprise in terms of direction compared to movie and comics but it's only the beginning.
Lindelof has had some hits and misses over the years but I have high hopes for this show. So, please give it a shot if you're somewhat open minded, not so easily offended and you're not usually taking everything on screen that you don't agree with as a personal attack.<br/><br/>And: Please keep politics out of IMDb! If you want a show based on the Klan and watching men have sex, this is the show for you. If you want something based on the amazing book or movie WATCHMEN, this isn't it. Skip this trash. The leftist agenda never ends. Nothing like the movie. Just more propaganda shoved in our face. As if the media needs more of it. Ugh. This first episode was a struggle to sit through, I didn't mind the intro... based off real events.
I struggled to stomach the cow farm being shot up.. i don't like animal violence depicted.<br/><br/>But the episode as a whole was just so slow, it bored me.
The cast seemed pretty good, the dialogue was nothing special.
Horseshoe birthday gag was amusing.<br/><br/>But, before writing this comment I had to google and see what others posted, people claiming not following the source material (fine, I only saw the Snyder film and that to me was fine and fun) others saying politically charged veins, but thats entertainment.. pushing envelopes, confronting, fun, ect..<br/><br/>Can't say i'm going to continue watching this.<br/><br/>I don't feel I am its target Audience.. are they expecting American viewers only? I dunno. i'm lost. He is very good at them, I'll give him that. You know what I mean... He makes a show, he puts in lots of things that make you go "Huh?" and eagerly await the explanation. Then he just... doesn't bother to give you that explanation.<br/><br/>This, I am confident, will be the fate of Watchmen, the TV series from HBO that people are inexplicably raving about. Quite what it has to do with the Watchmen, I don't know. Maybe there will be more of that later on, but I don't really care. Two episodes were enough for me to not have any interest in watching more of this Lindeloff fare.<br/><br/>I'd blame JJ Abrams for this. He did, after all, give us Lindelof, Orci and Kurtzman via Bad Robot productions. But Abrams is no better than they are. Decent director, but not one original bone in his body. It is hardly surprising that he spawned two of the worst writers going. Kurtzman gleefully ruins everything he touches and Lindelof just throws any old crap at the screen without thought to how it all fits together.<br/><br/>As for Watchmen, it is a dull take on racism who's only saving grace is that is set in alternative historical timeline. Now, when I say "saving grace" what I really mean is "interesting for a moment", because after that moment has passed, all that is left is a grim, unrewarding misery-fest that leaves you feeling depressed and in dire need of watching something fun and light, like Saw, or Seven.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this to anyone. Whatever mysteries it proposes will go unrevealed because of Lindelof, so ultimately it will be disappointing. That, plus the dreary tone and grim subject matter make this an endurance test, rather than an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Dull and full of nonsense. Mysteries that will never be revealed. Good actors given rubbish to work with. Best avoided. Warning! If you're a die hard Trump supporter, you will not enjoy watching this.
It takes a couple of episodes to get into it but definitely worth it.
Hopefully a season 2 without Lindelof at the helm can be at least as good as the first. I really struggle to even continue watching this series.
OK made, some acting and coreografy are in dire need of improvement.<br/><br/>I find the overall story and the way it's told, absolute garbage.<br/><br/>_Huge_ fan of the 2009 movie. So it might be why I find this. I'm not going to give a vote to this show yet, I'll wait to the end of the first season.
That sayed, I find ridicolus that so many people gave to this show a 1 star rating (1 means absolute garbage, in theory) just after watching the first episode, with the excuse that :"this is not watchmen" (?) .
This TV show is objectievly very good and not only from a narrative point of view, we have to consider the acting, cinematography ecc..
It has his flaws like every other show and you can dislike it, but if you judge you should try to be at least a bit objective. If this is a 7 stars show, IMDB average TV show votes should drop by a very big amount. If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Original Review (based on the season's first six episodes handed to press):<br/><br/>When I discovered that a new show based on the world of Watchmen was in the works, I really didn't have any sort of reaction. But then it was announced that Damon Lindelof (responsible for co-creating my favorite TV series ever, Lost) was the mind behind all of it and that the show wouldn't follow either the graphic novel or Zack Snyder's film, I was genuinely excited. I really enjoy 2009's Watchmen, but I always felt that a single movie (even with an extended runtime) was not enough to showcase its complex rules and layered themes. With this series, Lindelof delivers one of the best new TV shows of the year!<br/><br/>Within the first six episodes, it's already remarkable what he's able to achieve. I've seen some people complaining about how political the season is... You do know we're discussing Watchmen, right? Both the comic and film are packed with politics and social messages relevant to this day and age. So, obviously, the TV series is also heavily centered around a political tone, and it's handled beautifully. Nowadays, it's challenging to produce anything that addresses sensitive issues because, well, people get offended pretty easily. Having in mind the opening sequence of the pilot (so brutal), it's undeniable that the show is incredibly brave in tackling historical moments in a fictional work.<br/><br/>While Snyder's style is occasionally present, the graphic novel has a tremendous impact on the series regarding its references and story. By now, the first episode has already aired, so you already have at least one hint of where the show might be placed in time and space. What I love the most about this season is undoubtedly its storytelling structure. Lindelof borrows his own tricks from Lost and uses the back-and-forward way of telling how the action is happening. This non-linear chronology of events generates tons of questions that are answered in innovative, intelligent, and twisty plot points.<br/><br/>I would say that the first two chapters ask more than explain, but from the third episode onwards, all have significant revelations (and a few more questions). Some are completely unexpected and shocking. Others may be predictable but are told through a unique perspective. Every time I finished an episode, I wanted the "Next Episode" button to click on (fortunately for me, I did have that button). This desire not only has to do with the captivating screenplay, but with the fully-developed, compelling characters. In the same way that the movie wasn't a generic superhero flick, this series deals with more profound thematics.<br/><br/>Regina King is a total badass as Sister Night, but it's Angela Abar who makes the viewer care about her. From her life principles to her strong personality, she has everything a protagonist needs. King shines in a few emotionally powerful scenes, but her action sequences are also impressive. Yes, let me get this out of the way: there's more than enough fights. If I'm not mistaken, every single episode has at least a couple of great action scenes. A few long takes, some excellent choreography, but just like the source material, Watchmen isn't about the (cool) fights.<br/><br/>Every character is really well-developed. From their backstory to their desires, everyone gets a good chunk of runtime, including the seemingly secondary characters. No one is "just there". Everyone has a role to play either in the intriguing plot or in the eventually important mysterious side stories. Jeremy Irons is phenomenal as Adrian Veidt, and I recommend patience and tons of attention to his story that seems isolated. It's probably the most puzzling subplot of the show. Jean Smart shares the lead torch with King from the third episode on, by portraying someone we all know and love. Once again, the casting is perfect, as well as her outstanding performance.<br/><br/>Tim Blake Nelson does a great job with the most fascinating secondary character, Looking Glass. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II doesn't have much to do as Angela's husband, Cal Abar, but he still offers a grounded display. Finally, Louis Gossett Jr gives the fitting mysterious vibe to "the wheelchair guy". Damon Lindelof doesn't hold back when it comes to reference other works. Easter Eggs to both the film and comic are spread across the entire season. He always hides a few critical elements to the plot in the background or even in plain sight (someone's secretary or office), so be sure to keep your eyes wide open.<br/><br/>Technically, I have to praise the costume design, which offers some awesome superhero outfits. I love how CGI-less the series is as well. There are tons of practical effects, the production design is astonishing, and the use of real sets delivers that realism that a green screen can never get quite right. The score is addictive and even helpful to understand where the story might be going (if you've seen the first episode, you should research where the title card came from).<br/><br/>Watchmen is one of the best TV shows to premiere this year. Its pilot resembles Lost's, where dozens of questions are asked, and barely any answer is given. So far, I only have one minor issue with one of the subplots that doesn't seem to be developing at the same pace or with the same concern as the rest. Everything else is pretty much seamless. From the phenomenal casting to the exceptionally well-developed, compelling characters, Damon Lindelof is able to deliver yet another fantastic TV series. The technical quality is impeccable as expected, but it's the original take on a post-Watchmen (comic/movie) through an incredibly captivating storytelling structure that impresses me the most. If you're a fan of Snyder's film or the comic, definitely don't miss this show! If you have no past experience with this world, then this series won't stop to explain to you what happened or how things got where they're at.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts (based on the remaining episodes and the entire season):<br/><br/>I never thought I would be re-reading my original review, and laugh so much at myself for thinking certain characters or particular subplots wouldn't have that much interest or impact in the narrative. My only issue concerning the first six episodes revolved around a subplot involving Lady Trieu (Hong Chau), which I found to be slowly developing, and it was the only story I wasn't able to fit with the others. So, my overall opinion on the season would heavily depend on how the last three episodes tie everything together...<br/><br/>Damon Lindelof is a genius. You know when something is so incredible that we start getting a bit angry because of how flawless it is? That's me on the penultimate chapter, A God Walks into Abar. It's one of the best episodes based on exposition in the history of television! Looking back, I can now affirm that every single shot matters. Every line of dialogue, every tiny little detail. If Game of Thrones ditched tons of narratives and prophecies in its last season, Watchmen does the exact opposite: it literally ties every thread, big or small, together in a seamless fashion.<br/><br/>If you are part of the group of people who gave up on the first episodes due to their ambiguousness, then you missed the answers to the questions that made you quit. You missed one of the best-written seasons ever. Patience is a virtue, and everyone should go back and watch the whole show before jumping to impulsive decisions. I promise: every single story makes sense, and all are blended together in the most perfect, mind-blowing, entertaining way possible. From the wheelchair old man to the whereabouts of Dr. Manhattan or Adrian Veidt, you won't be disappointed. The ending will generate discourse for years or at least until an inevitable (?) second season.<br/><br/>If, after six episodes, I couldn't wholly assert that Damon Lindelof delivered one of the best TV shows of the year, now I can. Watchmen is not only the best TV series of 2019, but it's one of the best debut seasons I've ever witnessed. From its jaw-dropping writing to the outstanding performances, it possesses more than just a couple of near-perfect episodes. It might scare some people off due to its initial vagueness, but the last episodes compensate the time spent thinking about the numerous questions. If you're a fan of the graphic novel or of Zack Snyder's film, you need to experience this TV adaptation. Just make sure you have previous knowledge of this world because Lindelof doesn't stop to introduce anyone to how things work... Love the familiarity and concept of this show. Great cast and acting. I have a high IQ, but I couldn't follow it. I've deleted the record for next week. As a fan of the graphic novel, I absolutely loved the story told in Season 1 (just 1 more episode left as of this writing). What starts off as a seemingly racism-centric narrative gradually weaves a great yarn around interesting new characters and links to events that happened in the graphic novel. The episode revealing the origins of the first vigilante in the Watchmen universe is particularly outstanding, and there are more episodes that had left me thinking about the great story long after viewing. The storytelling is top notch across the season, the acting is great and there are more than a few "OMG" moments for any fan of the graphic novel / movie. Many folks have unfortunately rated it poorly after just viewing the first few episodes (maybe they expected the standard lightweight superhero fare) - but I felt the quality of the first season overall is at par with the best shows out there! I am just reviewing this as a standalone TV series, so not concerning myself with the comic or movie.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to a dark, adult exploration of what a world with super "heroes" would be like but, so far, this is one issue that is largely ignored. The main plot element is the issue of racism in America. The opening scenes depicting the Tulsa Race Riots was stunningly effective and highlighted an event I had never even heard of before (and would be a fascinating subject for a documentary).<br/><br/>After this impressive opening though the show became dull and pedestrian, and the principle problem is the main character.<br/><br/>Regina King is a superb actress but here her character is so dull and monotone that it is impossible to engage or care about her. This is a huge problem as she is the core around which the series seems to have been constructed.<br/><br/>It really hit me when watching the 3rd episode. Here Jean Smart's Agent Blake made her appearance and suddenly the whole show seemed to have taken off, showing some pace, decent dialogue and some edginess so badly lacking from the first two episodes. I went into episode 4 with renewed hope therefore, but instead it was back to the previous glacial pacing, forgettable plot and relentlessly dull lead character.<br/><br/>The only exception to this so far is the story-line featuring Jeremy Irons as Adrian Veidt. These quirky scenes are interesting and are build a sense of menace and intrigue. Although Irons american accent is as bad as ever, these scenes almost feel like they are from a different and, frankly, better show.<br/><br/>I will try and stick with it to the end as I do want to support shows which take a chance, but on the evidence to date it will be a chore rather than a pleasure. Came into this series knowing literally nothing; had not heard this was a thing and didn't even tie it to the Graphic Novel until truly bizarre Rorschach's appeared.<br/><br/>Disjointed narrative through the first 4 episodes with a lot of violence for the sake of pointless violence, not well shot with too much CGI and choreography. Had to listen to Don Johnson sing, which was cruel.<br/><br/>There are some actors playing it well (lead actress in particular)... but poor writing, as usual, leaves it feeling bland.<br/><br/>Way too many moments of utter confusion... and also truly awful music selections for scenes that last way too long.<br/><br/>Will try to stick out this 1st season but man... this is rough going. This shows plot is essentially what if America has police super heroes that fight racism the only crime that exists anymore. Nothing seems to have happened in the show yet after hours of watching besides setting up some kind of social wet dream for certain political leanings. The series is extremely boring and spends most of its time preaching political beliefs than telling an interesting story. Why make this thing Watchmen branded I have to ask? I thought the racial thing would be a subtext/subplot of the show, not the show entirely. I'm part black, but this show is over the top and obnoxious. Worse yet, like the new Spiderman movies, the racial messages it tries to send about history are often not presenting all the facts or just plain poorly researched and lacking in common sense. It's a shame HBO wasted the potential of this show pulling this stunt. Will they do this with Game of Thrones next.<br/><br/>Just cancel it already, please. I was really looking forward to seeing this, i thought the movie was ok, and hoped new special affects would move it from ok to good. But this was just jumbled garbage. It's a shame it's taking up an hour's slot of prime time TV. Ditched it, This act is not very good at acting and the story is really bad, Go watch the movie instead. The two factions are bad and worse. Feels like there needs to be a third party that ends up on top. It is ok but no comparison to the masterpiece the film was What an absolute disgrace to the Watchman name.<br/><br/>The comics and 2009 movie did such a fantastic job focusing on big picture issues, tackling the tense geopolitical climate during the Nixon administration, deep philosophies such as the meaning of life and the people's right to know vs. international peace.<br/><br/>The HBO television show stripes away all that and instead focuses solely on race. The white supremacists have adopted the Rorschach mask as their symbol (which is incredibly misguided as that's not what he stood for), and the mask wearing police hunt down these white supremacists with a shoot first ask questions later mentality, using torture on suspects without batting an eye.<br/><br/>No doubt supporters of the show will declare that haters are either too dumb to understand the show's little mysteries or are just plain racists if they dislike the show.<br/><br/>If Hollywood wants to create a race-baiting radically liberal television show, by all means go for it, just please don't call it Watchmen. Add this to the unfortunate miss column for Alan Moore along with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. But I didn't.
On paper it sounded great.<br/><br/>It's a very American story line, with the focus on American history and their current issues and...fascination with race.
Which is fine but as someone living outside the US, I just didn't get it.<br/><br/>Which would've been ok but...<br/><br/>I found the pacing to be very uneven, at times I was hooked and for long stretches I was very bored.<br/><br/>I don't know what went wrong, but it just didn't come together for me. A new show for the woke millennials without any substance just here to make them feel better.
No idea why they bothered buying the watchmen licence it has nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>Watch the original movie again and dont lose your time with this turd. If you like unintelligent superhero genre movies and having a current political narrative shoved down your throat, grab the popcorn. Stay woke y'all Promising start, I will definitely come back for the next episode...in fact, pretty sure I ll watch the whole season.
I wanna point out the good cinematography...I wasn't expecting to be this good after watching the trailers. I read the watchmen when I was younger the stories and writing were superb.<br/><br/>I'm going to give the series a few more episodes to get traction but so far I'm very disappointed. I will say Regina is a very good actress It's well done and the acting is of course great. I would give it a high rating if they didn't call it Watchmen. I don't care about the politics. It's fiction. It takes place in another universe, get over it. I was trying to make sense of what i was watching the entire pilot episode and i was still as confused when it ended.The action part was decent but Lack of character development and jumps between scenes had me quite confused. I'm not sure what the show is actually about even at this point Another production that has the sole purpose of educating the viewer about identity issues and how  people are bad for minorities. Hollywood has lost the ability to do something simply fun for the average person and instead has chosen to teach us, the ignorant mass, about their enlightened worldview (because they are the real good people!). It has reached the level of pathological obsession, really. First of all, in case it's not clear to other readers who are looking for an objective review and may be confused by the extreme polarization here, the gist of it is that Lindelof's repurposed the property to become a social commentary on race relations in the United States. This has had a predictable and fully intentional divisive effect - fans of the source material are not happy, and criticize it heavily; self-styled defenders of social justice rate it a 10, often sight unseen.<br/><br/>The series picks up the Watchmen narrative to Tulsa, Oklahoma where a white supremacist group called the Seventh Kavalry have taken up arms against the local police, prompting a special allowance for the police to wear masks of their own to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them and their families. An ex-cop and now vigilante named Sister Night investigates recent Seventh Kavalry activities and uncovers scheming and surprises in her own past.<br/><br/>The series' most interesting aspect is that it doesn't follow the canon of the 2009 movie, but that of the original comic, which (no spoilers) has a major effect on the ending premise of the movie. This feeds into the narrative in minor, but slightly interesting ways.<br/><br/>The social agenda is very beat-you-over-the-head-with-a-stick explicit. Beyond the core plot itself, every white man in the series is either a vocal racist, closet racist, or in some instances, ally, but one who is bumbling, flawed, and/or unreliable - usually all three. That includes Adrian Veidt, who despite having been portrayed as capable in the sources, has now become a idiosyncratic semi-functional lunatic living on a crazy farm, and whose assets have been justly taken over by a much smarter, much more capable minority woman. One scene in episode four has one of Laurie's associates spurned for trying to join a meeting with Lady Trieu - it's signaled to him that this is an important meeting, so obviously only women may attend. You could just hear the usual suspects screaming, "YES! CINEMATIC JUSTICE" into their TV sets.<br/><br/>Every character from a traditionally underrepresented group - from Sister Night to Laurie Blake to Lady Trieu to even Sister Night's husband - is idyllic; either as scrupulously pristine as virgin snow, superhumanly competent at all things, or both. This is surely Lindelof trying to rebalance the scales of historical injustice in media portrayal, but it's a story-compromising deviation from the original material where we had many characters of varying moral ambiguity, each with some virtues, but with significant weaknesses which contributed significantly in making the plot gritty and interesting.<br/><br/>Rorschach's been reappropriated to become a figurehead for the Seventh Kavalry, which seems to be a misunderstanding on Lindelof's part of the source material. Although Rorschach is portrayed with a major conservative skew and as a moral absolutist, there's no support for the traits that he's slandered with here. Readers who made it to the end will know that despite Rorschach being defined by tragically deep character defects, in a very significant way he turns out to be the most incorruptible figure in the story.<br/><br/>Some of the world building is also quite novel - the technology of Trieu Industries, special phones that allow you to send messages to Dr. Manhattan on Mars, and squid rain.<br/><br/>You'll have an idea by now as to whether you're going to like it or not. I think it's fair to say that many fans of the original will not, but there's certainly a healthy subset of people out there who will. I found it to be a solid "B", but with a social agenda that's so distracting that it becomes seriously detrimental. I kept reading things that were turning me off, but I watched this show and it's really a great show. It's action packed, weird and super dark. Yeah, there is a socio/political tilt to it. But seriously, don't let that stop you from enjoying a good show. A ridiculous, badly written show that is Watchmen in name only. Fans of the movie (great) and the graphic novel (phenomenal) despise this show for the same reason Alan Moore wants nothing to do with it. I couldn't get past the first episode. And I watch all things comic book related. I'm even getting through the train wreck that is Black Lightning.
This is unwatchable garbage. Its so bad, pretentious, unrealistic and poor written. I dont think Alan Moore would watch it. They dont want to tell a history, they want to make things happen in the baddest way possible, the motivations of characters change all the time. I came because of alan moore but this just sucks...black panther is so overrated and this one too...i am not racist as i have brown skin This is just a complete mess mix of different styles, which doesn't go anywhere and interests nobody. It is well done but there is definitely no point! I made my way through 3 episodes and that's it, it is really too dumm ðŸ˜œ I don't care about all the race talk in the show but I don't get what's happening in this show. I have read both the book and watched the movie and I don't understand a thing Terrible is not a bad enough description. If you're a lobotomized, SJW/NPC living in you're mommy's basement, with nothing better to do but keyboard warrior all day about how "racism" and "hate" then this might be for you. If you're anywhere near normal you'll definitely hate it. I made it almost through the first episode and then I shut it off and took a shower. Too bad, I loved the movie but this is nothing even close. Total garbage. Whilst the acting is fine I am just not seeing where the entertainment is. The plot seems nonsensical and the Watchmen not Watchmen. Nothing wrong with the flashbacks but there are too many and most could be covered by a couple of sentences of conversation.<br/><br/>High production values - tick. But no ticks for plot, intelligibility or entertainment. Peeped the show, loved it. AV club gave this an A, the user reviews on here suck. Alt right/white supremacist would definitely misinterpret Roreshach's intent. Not interested in what you are selling. Moving on. An intricately woven tapestry. A television marvel.<br/><br/>I can't believe I took this long to watch it. Wow.<br/><br/>Perfectly written. Perfectly cast. Stunningly shot. Geniusly scored. This is the first IMDB review I've ever written. What an enthralling, marvelous piece of art.<br/><br/>Please, please, please make more. TV-Watchmen fails in two ways that ought to be mutually exclusive; it can be hard to follow for those who haven't read the original novel and know all the names/references by heart, but it also has little to do with Alan Moore's source (especially by the start). Even when it does finally explain things to new viewers that old fans might understand immediately, e.g. the presence of a bizarre squid rain, it's done briskly in a way that may befuddle newcomers but provide hollow fanservice for the old-timers, not that member berries excuse all the other key points missed by the show (early on, for instance, I didn't feel that this was the same universe that famously deconstructed masked superheroes and made them pitiful).<br/><br/>However, let's ignore the fact that the very idea of a sequel to the comic book also ruins the openness of its ending, where the reader is permitted to look at Rorschach's ever-changing inkblot mask and either see a champion of ultimate truth or an enemy of world peace; where Ozymandias (for some reason played here by Jeremy Irons) either successfully brought the nations together through his conspiracy, or failed when/if Rorschach's journal was released.<br/><br/>Let us simply accept the reality that someone wanted to do big-budget fanfic about what happened next in this alternate history and what became of the world after Ozymandias' masterstroke. What we can then ask questions about is why the show's answer to the novel's timely Cold War anxiety is to anviliciously adapt the AntiFa vs. white supremacist squabbling, why Rorschach would become a symbol of freedom/truth only for ethno-nationalists when his truth leaked (unless we buy that Moore sincerely thinks his best character was no more complex than a right-wing as***le), why the VFX used to bring this universe alive have gotten worse since Snyder's attempt, or why the dialogue sounds like it is from a much dumber comic that isn't as satirical about the ridiculousness of masked heroes.<br/><br/>When I reviewed the first episode, this was one of my main complaints. We're definitely meant to think it looks super cool when Tulsa officer Angela Abar (Regina King) dons the Sister Night habit and beats up men thrice her size, doing the work no regular Tulsa policemen will. However, I now feel like figures such as Looking Glass (Tim Blake Nelson) and Red Scare (Andrew Howard) shine a light on the more pathetic side of costumed heroes, the way Watchmen ought. Red also confirms that the show doesn't kiss the derriere of every faction within the modern radical left, as geeks aplenty have feared.<br/><br/>We also get Jean Smart as Laurie "Silk Spectre II" Blake, because I guess she eventually became okay with bearing The Comedian's last name, and she apparently lusts after the vanished superman Dr. Manhattan after breaking up with Nite Owl. Don Johnson plays "one of the good ones" amongst white policemen but you can guess what sort of twist they build towards. Louis Gossett Jr. appears as a mysterious survivor of the Tulsa riots. Hong Chau portrays a character that seems to rival Ozymandias in terms of intelligence and creativity. As I said, Ozzy himself is played here by Jeremy Irons, and his increasingly outlandish subplot was more intriguing than anything taking place in Tulsa.<br/><br/>Of course, there is always the issue of experiencing Watchmen within a set number of minutes. With the novel, you could spend as much time on a given page, going back and forth between the panels as you want, which is thematically significant when you consider how Dr. Manhattan experiences time (you can read the panels in any order you want, but the timeline remains preordained). For what it's worth, the show has some clever ways of communicating how he perceives existence.<br/><br/>I won't reveal who eventually plays Manhattan or how they justify the casting, but it seems like another non-veiled middle finger to the perceived white supremacist fanbase. They do something similar with Hooded Justice and while making creative choices out of pure spite (especially toward white supremacists) is way up my alley, why co-opt the Watchmen IP for this?<br/><br/>I guess it's because Watchmen is loved by nerds, and nerds are supposedly prone to racism and sexism (especially if they dare not worship Captain Marvel and The Last Jedi, the monsters) but still. You can't just say "the book also had political allusions" and decide that ergo it makes sense for the TV version to simply sneer at one side and pander to the other. If you aren't gonna do justice its satire of the superhero or its distinct, purposeful visuals, can you at least give me its complexity and difficult questions? What am I even saying? It's HBO.<br/><br/>Still, did I enjoy the finale and how everyone and everything came together? I suppose. I just don't know that I needed to wade through all of that cringe factor to get there. After 3 episodes I can still say I have no idea about some of the plot lines.<br/><br/>Neither of us know the Watchmen story line and gave up after 3 episodes. I was starting to piece together the main plot with the police but the guy in the stately home seemed utterly ambiguous.<br/><br/>I don't mind working for a plot, but it needs to give me something concrete after this amount of time.<br/><br/>It had promise, but didn't fulfil. Why is the author of this series? Guilty Mcwhitey? "Could you imagine a white supremacist group having that kind of power?". "Being a white man is hard in today's world, so I think I'll become a blue one?". This is yet another project that had potential and was ruined, a la Star Wars, by identity politics, political correctness, and Leftist ideology. I watch scifi as a form of escapism. Can't we simply have good scifi films, or films in general these days, without having an agenda shoved down our throats? And before anyone starts ne calling me here, just want to mention I'm a registered Democrat. Have been for 40 years now. It's typical Lindelof. The show isn't all bad but it's a 2 legged table. Cast, production and sound are great, art direction is OK too... some great moments from the cast and pretty entertaining... the show's attempt at trying to explore current sociopolitical issues is ambitious, feels Watchmen, and yet comes off as a corporation trying to cash in on the problems of racism by making a topically themed superhero show... My main problem with the show is that it is constructed entirely from 'reveals', flashbacks and dumb symbolism. Masks and reveals a la Scooby Doo... also Watchmen isn't about watches, but there is a a prominent ticking and clock theme? Unimaginable stupidity of this kind hurts my heart. The action is bad, bad kung fu and dumb gun fights mostly covered with too many edits and shaky cam. Because it's Damon Lindelof, it's probably another 'Mystery Box' like Lost or Prometheus, you really get the feeling like all these reveals and twists aren't going to go anywhere. Ok so unlike others here I am holding off on reviewing this completely on the first episode. SO FAR yes they have changed a few things and made it politicalish. In other words there making creative decisions early on to weed out all the butt hurt nerds. Im really enjoying this new world and very excited to see where it goes. It definitely has potential to be brilliant, but also terrible. I will say they should of named it something else because yes it's a bit* off stream from the comics. (But so is every other effing show!!!!) But I'm enjoying it! Those calling it political propaganda, are obviously offended. I wonder why? The acting is great. I hope that more open minded people rate this show as well... Of the same quality like the last Batwoman thing - I just wonder where they get all these people (cloning!?) to produce that mass inflation of movies and shows embedded in that real dull getting superhero cosmos of DC or Marvel --> produced by braindead zombies for braindead zombies. Well I initially thought, oh here we go again, I need to be disgusted for being the wrong sex or race, but the black or white aspect and horrible injustice is dealt with in a dark humour way, so as not to be preachy or accusing, which is frankly excellent story telling but reminding people of a very terrible past which should never be forgotten. I much prefer to understand history in this way rather than a biased view of either side.<br/><br/>The female lead - too, is away of her history and her ancestors pain, but doesnt rub it into the open wounds of the watcher - neither does she big up herself or believe she is because of where she comes from and what shes seen - very refreshing to have any female that plays her part without insisting her way or the high way.<br/><br/>Go all you tv shows out there, THIS is how its done, to have a strong female lead and to do it right. I really wanted to love this. Not sure if it's because I'm from the UK, but I just didn't get it. This is normally right up my street or so I thought but I couldn't even see the 2nd episode through Just watched the First Episode and now I know why all these kalvery critics have their underpants in a bunch. It shows an ugly side of Amerikkka. Some can't take it.... hence all the 1s.<br/><br/>The show is shot beautifully, Regina King is marvelous, and the suspense is palpable. Dont listen to all the hate check it out yourself because agendas are in full bloom<br/><br/>Peace I have even stopped seeing late night talk shows like Kimmel and Fallon to escape the pc patrol and even the news cause I'm tired of racism and race wars, etc. I pretty much don't know much about Watchmen except for the movie. So I was surprised that the theme of this show seems to be about race. To top it off it's written and directed/produced by the worlds worst writer: Damon Lindeloff. I'm just gonna give this two more chances before I tune out. HBO is really really becoming a great disappointment. Although it's only the pilot so far, I have found myself sucked into this show and have now gotten my wife hooked. I think we found our new show! I love the argument that this show is PC culture gone made or pushing race politics. If this show offends it's time for some self reflection. If a main black character offends you then this show isnt for you. If white supremacists being the bad guys offend you this show is for you. Funny watching people cry "PC gone made" when something offends them. This show is amazing and I'm nothing but entertained by all the crybabies on here. I wanted this series.
But,, Damon Lindelof...
The man who destroyed the Alien franchise.
I was right... Tiered of every new show I'm excited about to all have the same theme of evil white conservatives and super strong female hero's. I turned it off after the second episode. Rorschach also stood for truth and justice not white supremacy Haven't read the comics, I'm a watchwoman, pun inteded. I looved the movie, some genius that was. So I tried really hard to like the series, I even made it through episode 5! But I give up, I just can't! What an insult and torture to my brain, eyes and ears is this piece of crap? I would give it 0 stars if that was an option. Hmmm, might be missing something so I'll give it a few more episodes to get into gear. Ep1 looked mildly promising and so I'm hoping the writers have something hidden up their sleeves although the characters so far are nowhere near as memorable as in the film version of the story. Watched the first two episodes on Hulu and wanted more. Was a big fan of the comic and movie growing up. It's somewhat of a sequel to the original comic with a new storyline . I don't know why people are so confused, only two episodes have came out so obviously your questions won't be answered, at least not yet. Can't wait to watch more. First of all, I am infuriated but unsurprised by the negative feedback this has received from certain corners. However, the death throes of the white cishet male ego have little to do with my enjoyment of this truly exquisite work.<br/><br/>I first read Watchmen when I was 15 years old, and I will always remember where I was and how I felt as I read the last page. Never before had I encountered a story so complicated, so loaded in its evenhanded critiques of authoritarianism vs. libertarianism, morality and apathy...<br/><br/>I felt that during this hour of television.<br/><br/>I truly cannot stress this enough: if this hour is indicative of what's to come, we are in for a series that dares to be ballsy in its sociopolitical commentary (as opposed to Joker, which y'all voted into the IMDb Top 15) while standing by a brand of complexity and intersectionality that repels the right people. Also, Regina King is magnetic and Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' music slaps.<br/><br/>Do not miss. If you know even a little history of this country and a little more about how the dehumanization of people (any people, but in this case the Black enslaved) has poisoned the possibilities of this country AND if you have any capacity to think just a little deeply about the original graphic novel, you'll see. Open your eyes. I'm not usually one to write reviews, as is the obligatory start to these, but I felt compelled to say something because the love or hate nature of the reviews here don't do this show justice. No, the show isn't bad because of its politics, but it probably does have some bad politics. No, the show isn't a genius masterpiece, but it is sometimes stupidly clever.<br/><br/>I'll start with the positives: they got the sense of scale right, more so than the 2009 film. The heroes feel like the product of inept rage and it works. Tim Blake Nelson is great as the Rorschach stand-in. The central dynamics between the main characters are generally strong and interesting enough for a season. And some of the twists are totally unpredictable. The way they incorporated the squid, and some elements of the comic, is sometimes fantastic.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: Adrien Veidt has been stripped of his subtlety, of his essence, even though Irons is doing some heavy, heavy lifting. The soundtrack, besides Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score, is awful and hammy, relying on the same dumb juxtaposition over and over. And the writing is hit or miss, but at its worst it assumes the audience is so dumb that it will hit you over the head with really obvious stuff, replaying conversations to make sure you definitely get the point! And there are a lot of missed opportunities with at least a few characters reuniting and interacting in less than satisfying ways.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this is that it probably relies too heavily on its twists. Watchmen, the comic book, had its twists and turns, but not nearly on the scale of this. It becomes a little convoluted as it goes on. The last third is equal parts brilliant and really stupid. I have to wonder, if you took the story and just told it chronologically, just how good this show would be. I know that's not the point, but like, it just seems to rely too heavily on the joy of its own spiral. Which is fine, the comic book was also very much about the structure of itself, but this show is just not as well constructed. The pacing never settles and the character-based episodes feel overwritten.<br/><br/>In the end it's not a bad show. It does some things better than the movie. I hope they don't continue it, because I can't imagine it would be good past this point. It's a decent waste of a few afternoons, a few worthwhile meditations, and otherwise I guess I liked it more than I expected to. It's like they threw everything about the comic into a blender and made a weird chunky smoothie. But it's a fitting smoothie for our times. Here's another show what tells us what to think and they use a Watchmen skin for it. It has nothing to do with Watchmen, Iit's a propaganda. I felt like watching an old cartoon what tells me to eat vegetables. Good lord, how did this plot and overt amount of racism make it onto TV in the age of Pollitically Correct America?!? This show is absolute garbage and the network should issue an apology for ever airing it! Not for me. I know people will love it but I lost interest pretty much straight away. It's nothing original or fresh. I enjoyed the boys more If I'm honest. The characters weren't that interesting either and a bit dull. Forget the right-wing trolls and the hurt fanboys, this is fantastic. Can't wait for the next episode. Watchmen is brilliant. And its easily the best TV series this year. It just has the right amount of mystery, masterful cinamatography, intriguing characters and witty writing to keep you glued to your seat. If you like intelligent comic book writing, you gotta watch this. Oh and one more thing, do yourself a favour and ignore the triggered snowflakes rating this show 1/10 around here. Why IMDB tolerates the annoying alt-right review bombing is beyond me. Absolute disgrace that people give something 1 star, and write it off after 1 episode, commenting on what they expect from Lindelof. Someone even commented that he won't tie things up. Well I stayed to the end, and loved it. The series built each episode, tied up at the end, and left some things that may lead to another series (hopefully). Everyone's entitled to an opinion, but scoring a decent episode 1 out of 10, and writing a whole series off without watching it, actually (in my opinion) makes your opinion petty and diminished. I wonder how many 1 star reviews continued to watch it ðŸ¤” I really don't undestand, what authors are trying to say. Maybe I am too normal and not enough modern. For someone from Europe this simply does not make sense. Maybe in some superbly violent suburbs in US, this might make sense, but I really don't understand, what is the meaning of this nonsensical mixup. One point for it being different. One point for being Watchmen and one more point for possible future improvement. The show is decent and certainly has potential, will definitely continue watching. All of the super negative reviews are from the cult of trump though and if their poor grasp of the English language isn't enough evidence, you can just look through their review history to see they're not playing with a full deck. They hate that racism is being called out and they feel threatened, but no matter. They'll continue whining and crying like the mental midgets they are, but conservatism always, inevitably loses in the end which is why we have nice things today like equal rights, universal suffrage, no more slavery, woman's right to choose what happens to her body, and so on. This was a good chapter, the music is amazing and the action was good too This was beyond bad, a huge waste of time that I really regret watching, and all thru the time I wasted on this just one question kept nagging me: why was this series really made, what was the big idea or reason behind it?.
I do not recommend it at all You will LOVE this show. It is so freaking engaging!!!!!!<br/><br/>If you have not read the comic, probably do that first then watch it. This show is a joke so far. I find it hard to believe Regina King as a superhero cop. The show is slow, has no connection to the comics or movie other than some vague references to Doctor Manhattan and Rorschach. So far in my opinion it is garbage. The head writer wrote the "Lost" show which was also a joke and disappointment to fans. DC needs to get their heads together in order to keep up with Marvel and stop letting DC fans down with their mediocre movies (ie Justice League, Joker, and Batman vs Superman. )
Box office reviews mean nothing to die hard DC fans. WAKE UP DC AND GET WITH THE PROGRAM or slowly fade into obscurity.
Just my opinion. I was looking forward to this show, but it is a huge Disappointment!
I cannot understand what the storyline is supposed to be, it is convoluted and seems to point to some kind of black underclass which comes across as at the very least ill-judged and at the worst racist.
The storylines are weird but not in a good way, honestly there is nothing to like about this show, the actors and unlikable, the script is incoherent and it seems to have some kind of political agenda.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and skip this show, it is a massive waste of time and money<br/><br/>2 out of 10<br/><br/>And do not believe the fake reviews, It helps if you sort your search by prolific reviewers, that helps to weed out the lies. UPDATE:
While the series did improve and I'd have to upgrade it from a 5 to a 6, there were still big problems. The series added more reference to the original Watchmen graphic novel which improved things, too often I found it annoying. The biggest annoyance was that the Ozymandias character appeared to be plated as a joke. Most of the rest of the series was played dead series, but I felt with him I was watching the old Batman TV show from the 60s! Also, the best character was easily Dr Manhattan, especially the retelling of the first meeting with his wife, which was fantastic. But then they kill him off in a premise I did entirely buy.
To sum up, better, but still not great.<br/><br/>INITIAL REVIEW:
Just watched the first episode of Watchmen. It was well produced with plenty of action, but the connection to the original Watchmen is limited and when it's there it seems forced and unconvincing. The Watchmen book took the superhero genre and twisted it into commentary on our society. There's minimal and perfunctory elements of the superhero. Without the imagination of the original Watchmen world, it feels nothing more than a police procedural.<br/><br/>Sometimes the writing interesting, but sometimes it glaring terrible. It's worrisome to see supposedly intelligent characters behave impossibly stupid only because of lazy writing. For example, at the end the head police chief goes off alone in his car. His house has heavy police protection, he knows there's an organization killing cops, but he still travels without protection. Then when his tires are flattened on a lonely road, he calmly gets out never expecting trouble. It's incredibly dumb and just plain bad writing. Not a good sign for the future episodes. Having read the graphic novel and seen the original movie, die hard fans will be divided on this one. It has great visuals, but storyline is very bland, and the characters just done fit. And no matter what the media-soaked people say, this show, objectively, has an obvious political agenda that sticks out like a sore thumb. Yes we get it... your far leftist agenda and current overblown view is non-refutable gospel. Quite trying to convince us by shoving it down our throats constantly in a nauseating and trope-filled way. And no... I'm not a MAGA-hat toting person like everyone wishes I were. Then it would be easy to throw reviewers like us into a category, like it is easy to categorize this show as another attempt to reface a classic into yet another politically correct mess. I'll try not to give away too much, but from a long time fan of Watchmen, it's shaping up to become something quite spectacular.<br/><br/>To anyone that either had reservations of the show after the first episode aired or refused to continue seeing it after the review bombing that followed, just know that it's extremely faithful to the graphic novel and goes to incredible lengths to achieve that. The over racial themes you saw in the first episode doesn't play the role you may think it did if you judged the rest of the story from that and it absolutely does not turn this world into a ship to carry a cargo of agendas. The themes this new addition to the Watchmen story covers are many, and from many sides. They're powerful, unique, and hard-hitting. Yes, as we've seen from the first episode, race, but also how this alternate world dealt with the trauma from Veidt's 'Inter-dimensional' monster. The manner in which the world reacted and readjusted to those events, or attempted to, the victory against Vietnam, and so much more. You and I both know that Alan Moore wouldn't check this out, and respectfully so. He created a perfect story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. A story to cover the themes and messages he wanted to convey, and although this new story doesn't follow the same themes of the graphic novel they do pay extreme respects to the original world that was built in order to have the principles for this entirely new story with it's new accompanying themes. The storytelling is fantastic, it doesn't hold your hand and having knowledge of the story that came before does reward the viewer. Cinematically beautiful, the budget shows. Objectively, it's very well made.<br/><br/>P.S. I've seen The Critical Drinker's review, and some others as well. I can happily say that many of the negative points brought up from these reviewers to criticise the show based on the first episode have become falsified following the recent episodes, which is the reason why I wrote this for anyone that was afraid this show was a butcher of what we know and love. It's not in the slightest.<br/><br/>But, this is just one man's opinion. Take it as you will. :) All 10 and 1 star reviews should be ignored by readers and vetted by imdb. The quality of reviews has taken a huge decline over the past few years. A great shame.<br/><br/>Production wise, it's well made and acted, though you wouldn't expect anything less today. Aside from the cow scene, which is over the top and poorly orchestrated. The good guys shine with not so much as a scratch and the bad guys lose out, despite having superior firepower. SIlly. It removes all sense of danger from future battles. That alone is enough to stop caring. A shame, as I was hoping to stick with it.<br/><br/>The real reason many are turned off by this series is the Race War at it's core, heralded in your face from the opening minutes. It's divisive. People are sick of race politics. They're sick of gender and identity politics in general. Hollywood overplays it every chance they get it. People are suffering from Victim weariness. This isn't the 1920's or the 50's. Producers green-lighting this type of material are to blame. Writers and directors are only creating their work because they know it will be funded. Isolating a massive chunk of your audience isn't the way to move forward. Imagine if the races were reversed? The hypocrisy is astounding. It wouldn't be made. And no I'm not right, I'm left. I'm tired of it. So are many. This is not how to build unity, nor tell original, creative stories. I don't believe there are any spoilers in this review, the producers of this show have managed that themselves.<br/><br/>After eagerly awaiting the TV adaptation of Alan Moores intelligent, inciteful examination of 'real' super heroes and societal breakdown, the disappointment of US TV drama has struck again. It seems that the entire premise of the story has apparently been dropped in favour of yet another tale of common racist bigotry. I have no objections to this, except for the innumerable times it has been done before and the blatant disregard of the more pertinent and rarely examined themes of the comic and, to a lesser extent, the film. It appears that we are in for yet another yawn fest of a female lead, inexplicably able to beat down opponents twice her size while having next to no physical attributes more than a cute halloween mask (similar to Robin of Batman fame), a fetching 'little black riding hood,' cloak and a teenagers body. I'm expecting lesbians and gay men to make an appearance in the coming episodes, all of whom will be valiantly aligned against the racists. (Choose your own socially acceptable cliche and insert here). I shall watch up to episode four in the likely vain hope that the writing 'genius' who gave us the interesting premise of Lost, but delivered the tedius monotony of that show has had some sort of epiphany and acquired a modicum of talent, unlikely, I know, but sometimes hope is all we have. The marketing and IMBD description don't do a great job conveying to you what this show really is. It's a sequel to the original Watchmen comic, following different characters and some returning ones. It's probably necessary to read the comic or at least understand what happens in it.<br/><br/>Obviously the comic is immensely popular though it's still so bizarre that a mainstream series on HBO acts as a direct sequel to a comic from the 80s, not really explaining who's who and what's what. It's kinda wild.<br/><br/>This series focuses more heavily on the terrorist and hate group aspect of vigilantism which is super unique and fascinating. The comic was extremely political and willing to examine real-world problems so its great to see the show reflect on heavy crap.<br/><br/>The returning characters from the comic are extremely well portrayed. The new characters are compelling and I'm interested in where the show may take them. Overall great casting.<br/><br/>Who the old characters have become and how he world has evolved is pretty believable. This feels far more natural and compelling, then delving into the already well explored past of this world and its characters as the spin-off comics did.<br/><br/>The story itself is rather mixed so far- It's easy to see where the plot is going in some areas. Potential twists are pretty obvious and I hope they subvert my expectations instead of just falling right into them.<br/><br/>The dialogue can sometimes come off as a little less clever then it thinks it is. The effects can look pretty cheap at points - it's obvious this show doesn't have Game of Thrones money behind it. The few fights so far have been rather choppy and mediocre but fighting has never really been what Watchmen has been about so it's not hard to overlook.<br/><br/>Diving into hate groups and reparations for hate crimes are super topical and perfect stuff to grapple with in a story like this. It also gives some needed breathing room from the source material. However, I wish they had dived more into the impact of the attack on New York and Rorschach's journal. I mean an extra-dimensional creature killing 3 million people is gonna leave a massive impact in American Culture, it's like 9-11 x 1000. The show seems a shrug off some of these events rather nonchalantly when they could have used them to explore interesting themes.<br/><br/>We're only three episodes in so who knows where the show may go. So far I'm intrigued and definitely plan to keep on watching as weeks go on. I wouldn't say its tv gold but each episode grabs me more and more. There too many creative ideas, deeply relevant topics, and unexpected spins on a classic work of comic literature to ignore. We'll see how this quirky little thing turns out. I love the fact a lot of revierwers felt uncomfortable...
White supremacy = s#. This is not a left fact. It's human fact. And until all human being learn that I hope see more show like this I'm not familiar with the graphic novel and came to this series cold. It's a little confusing at first without any back story info, but that's OK. You pick it up as it goes along. I like the alternate universe ideation, though it would be interesting to know what event started the alternative. I guess that will be in future episodes. The acting, costumes, story, and just about everything else was compelling. Good to see Don Johnson and Lou Gossett back. I hope they keep up the good work. Episode 1 was a winner. More comic book t trash. This is typical of HBO. They spin, hype, & run a huge campaIgn as if running for president. Unfortunately, it leaves much to be desired, which is typical. The best "series" (besides over the top 'game of toilets') is by far "The Night Of", which is brilliant. A lot of publicity spinning, with a simple plot in an alternate universe. Ho hum. African American certainly rule the world of watchmen. This gonna be a great show, as Good as the Leftovers S02. I found the series almost impossible to watch. Not being an American, I don't understand the context of the series, and maybe that's why, but I was really disappointed. I don't know if that is a problem with the series or whether it was intentionally not meant for an outside audience, but it makes the series very difficult to enjoy. I sit through entire episodes and i dont feel like anything important is happening. Well anyway I'm giving up on this one. But as WatchThem, it rocks a dystopian story of its own.
In this first episode: Best Interrogation Ever.
And Don Johnson is still rockin' the Stetson. Super racist/ SJW punks virtue signaling to the max! Absolute garbage ðŸ˜‚ It was just so weird that it was refreshing. I was more mesmerized than interested, but I enjoyed the first episode and look forward to more. I was expecting something akin to the movie. Whoa, was I mistaken. I won't pretend that I know everything there is about Watchmen universe, but I've watched the movie and graphic novel.<br/><br/>This show does borrow some key elements from the existing universe, but not as much as it should.
After watching the first episode I feel like nothing of importance happened and like I was watching a 15 minute episode of something. Pilot episode should be the most impactful to keep audiences attention and interest.
Original movie was really gritty and dark, this one I don't know.. I'm still confused.
Although I liked the score in the episode, tone, plot and acting could've been better. It feels like it's a show almost not at all connected to the Watchmen universe.
I did recognize political ideologies, but I don't think they were that impactful to the overall plot. I've seen worse.<br/><br/>All in all, I would definitely watch few more episodes before giving it a permanent pass. Still, after this one I don't expect a big improvement. I'm hopelessly devoted to this series since second 1. I ended up episode 8 with a smile. A very unique type of smile. The one only found in those rare occasions where one realizes of having watched a masterpiece. Like many TV shows, you can't explain every detail and every character all into one hour of a first episode.  Well here's a spoiler for you, I AM from Tulsa, and yes that horrible race riot DID happen over pure stupidity! I guess the fans of the comic never get bored with the overused backdrop of NYC and some form of a global threat. From a good movie to a racial issues, nothing good in this TV show Wat did I saw?I really was looking forward for this and the 1st episode was a mess,why should I continue watching the rest of the season if I did not like, not even one character in the show?Why make a TV show that the plot does not make you want to see more and the protagonists do not make you care if they die or not? Very well-written and a great world building. Damon lindelof shows that an original story based on a classic franchise is possible I have heard 2 arguments as to why this show is bad. One of them is that this isn't a faithful adaptation to the source material and the easy response is to say IT ISN'T. This show is not an adaptation of the graphic novel, it is a continuation that has brought the themes to modern times. The second argument I hear is that it is too political and too "woke" and if you think that, you never understood Watchmen. The Watchmen graphic novel is INCREDIBLY political commentary regarding Nixon-era politics and if you didn't see that then you need to re-read it. A lot of people also complain that Rorschach is now the face of a white supremacist movement and that should make complete sense, if you read the graphic novel and thought Rorschach was someone to look up to or was the hero of the story, I'm sorry but you're an idiot. This show is incredibly well made and acted with fantastic writing that stays true to the themes of Watchmen while adding new context to apply to a modern audience. If you dont want to watch a show with themes that actually matter regarding racism, don't watch this. If you actually understood the graphic novel, this is the show for you. I'm not sure what the deal is with fanboys. When comics or any other stories change, people flip. I understand somewhat with other mediums but superhero stories always morph.<br/><br/>The point of comics was the same as folklore. In the old days wherever you went you heard about famous figures but everyone had a different story or fable. Stories touch us all in different ways and it is all too natural.<br/><br/>In closing, just like each Batman story seems to take some liberties with origin or modus operandi. Each iteration was used to wonder if the character changed in key aspects what he would be. Just because this might not be YOUR Watchmen it seems hypocritical to think so just because aspects are different.<br/><br/>I'm all for new ideas and I do get tired of recycled tiresome garbage that could've been done in another vehicle. But just because 2019 mustang isn't as fun to look at or drive as a '67 I'm still glad there are mustangs. This could've been some other show, I know but I'm glad it wasn't. Not being a reader of graphic novels and only seeing original Movie, I was greatly impressed although knowing it would come to a disappointingly short series. I found the twisting storylines requiring focus and nice blend from movie although I hear greatly different from novels.<br/><br/>Highly recommend watching and Kudos to cast and production team! Wish some other network picks it up and allow Director to continue in exacting storyline. Didn't expect where the show went but it was a totally welcome surprise. Excited to see where this goes! Is this really Watchmen?<br/><br/>I don't care at all, not a fan of the comics and found the movie enjoyable, came across this masterpiece with no expectations and now I find myself waiting intensely for every new episode.<br/><br/>Does It has a political standing, propaganda, personal agenda? Don't care either, this is the era of freedom of speech you can give your point in whatever way you like. But if you give it with an outstanding story, pace, filming and mood, it will hit the core of a lot of people.<br/><br/>It's elegant, entertaining, full of plot twist, every episode is a joy for the human eye. The best part? It keeps getting better and better every episode.This show is pure entertainment pictured in a delightful way that makes me google every character or part I don't understand from the past so I can take most out of this experience.<br/><br/>And if you are mad because it doesn't matches your comic expectations or you can't stand a "political" point of view or race approach different from yours. I'm sorry, put all the 1 star not fair reviews about the show you want, but at the end of the day this is the new Watchmen (the only one for me) and a lot of us are enjoying it big time. Show made no sense, was full of non sequiturs and I couldn't figure out who was who or why a stage play of Oklahoma was in the story other than as a filler. Whoever wrote this must have been on a powerful stimulant. It probably makes a lot of sense to the writers and director but I doubt anyone else came away from Ep. 1, saying "I can't wait 'til next week to see what happens". A waste of good talent and one hour of my time. Off the DVR it goes. If HBO thinks it will catch Netflix or Amazon with stuff like this, they need to set up a test audience and see what their reaction is. We open out the gate with a strong first episode, political and cultural issues we are facing all over the world not just america, a growing issue within our culture, the show is testing those waters, opening the idea to this alternate world, where they aren't even allowed certain types of technology, and the weather has been forever changed since the events of the comic book ending (Forget the movie ending) There is of course more that could be reflected between the HBO show and the comic book, and for those who think Watchmen was never political really didn't capture what the source material from Alan Moore was, I am a fan to the Movie but for the show it can be put to one side. I look forward to seeing where the show will take us and how it will address the issues within society. Please can we stop the hateful, negative message being put up on the reviews, as some are down right hateful, those who are listing 1 star are just trolling the page and can be disregarding do not play to their game, be more civilized and enjoy the story and journey. All day waiting for this, it is under my expectatives, where are the Watchem?
I must admit that there are part of the plots a little interesting, but not catchy enough, lets wait the second episode becasue this one was badly, so sad The cast is hit or miss. I loved Jeremy Irons, Hong Chau and Jovan Adepo. I really didn't like Regina King. It's party due to how her character is written. She is supposed to be everything: Caring mother, badass vigilante, sensual lover. I found her utterly boring and quite unrelatable. That's of course a matter of personal taste.<br/><br/>The original score is quite good, but the selection of stock music is pretty cliche and rather uninspired.<br/><br/>The story has a lot of flaws and a lot of logic holes. I won't spoil anything, so I won't go into too much detail. The biggest problem to me (at least in the beginning) was the unlikely antagonist threat. It's very 2019 however, which will make the show feel dated soon. It made me cringe often.<br/><br/>I understand that Watchmen is about alternate history, but that still doesn't sell me the idea that some people are just evil. The show introduces the concept of "secret racists" (spelling it even out). These are people who don't act racist, even have close sincere friendships with people of different ethnicities, BUT ARE EVIL because...well...the show doesn't really make that clear. However, it leaves no doubt those evil people deserve no less than death as punishment.<br/><br/>By the end I had stopped caring who makes it, except for one character. That one is then being judged harshly...by today's standards, for something he did 35 years ago in a situation of extreme threat, something that's supposed to be morally highly ambiguous (even in the original comic). The woke squad has no problem with harsh judgement, however.<br/><br/>Neither have I: mediocre at most, where it could have easily been great. You know Mr. Lindelof has proven now beyond all doubt, that he really doesn't know how to make a proper ending. It's really really bad and optimistic and doesn't fit at all with the tone of the comics.Is sloppy writing specially when you break your own rules (you don't have to believe, me take a look in the last episode and watch how ridiculous it is that a plastic lid can suddenly resist so much, you'll understand when you see it).Seriously, now I understand why one of the episodes is called "if you don't like my story write your own" Well I have Mr. Lindelof, and I'm sure there at least a 100 scripts with more attention and careful thought than this severely half-baked ending that is just so disappointing and telegraphed I just find it repulsive in every down to every last "justice is served" moment.That Lindelof is able to run an expensive show doesn't make him a better writer or a better storyteller, and that's why all the indie filmmakers need to really step up because after seeing this I can say that we really need them to. Maybe it's because I'm just coming off of watching Carnival Row, which was way less subtle about it's message for sure, but I'm getting a little burnt out. I mean, I don't remember Alan Moore's book being about white supremacy, did I read it wrong? If your going to shift the direction of a graphic novel so much, why not just make up your own story, like Moore said in many an interview. It's just another "hey guys, remember that racism is bad" story but riding on a popular name. No thanks. I'm hoping the rest of the season is better than this first episode. Besides the white supremacists using Rosarchs mask and a few Easter eggs there was nothing really having to do with watchmen this episode. The show leaves you with a lot of questions and no answers that I'm sure will come later on but I dont know if I want to sit through another hour being confused. The costumes so far look cheap it looks like everyone decided to cut up their old t shirts and where them as masks. I was bored for most of it. Thank you for turning dr manhattan black.
i hope he turns into a female later! There's basically too much to cover when trying to explain why "WATCHMEN" is so captivating and original. There are a thousand reviews and this one will get lost in the haystack of opinions. But the simplest way to cut through every opinion and give you the most gripping reason to watch is the fact that every episode truely without a doubt just gets better and better. I started out thinking it was pretty good and I am now just left in awe at how amazingly refreshing this show is on a week to week basis. Damon Lindelof has done an outstanding job. It's truely remarkable. My advice, You have to watch it. I can't recall a more disappointing show. I wanted to like it but had been hit hard in the face with all the PC political anti-white stuff from the very first shot. It's only gotten worse but in the sense that it's just boring. It's like Westworld where someone was given too much money and forgot to craft a real story. At least Westworld started out fun then got really repetitive and SUPER stupid with only one twist that kept me in for one more episode. Watchmen has just been bad from the start. I DO NOT CARE ABOUT AND AM NOT CONNECTED TO ANY CHARACTER AND THAT IS WHAT DEFINES GOOD SHOWS AND MOVIES. This has nothing to hold onto. I guess some people don't like it when black superheroes beat up.<br/><br/>I have watched this show, and I've watched a lot of TV - I keep track, (tvtime) 8 months and 15 days worth of TV in my life. If it was a legitimately bad show I think I would've noticed. The helpful and unhelpful options below will prove my point I think. Forget the backlash of comic fans moaning about how its not comic accurate. Its truely a awesome show with great music and action and perfect acting Watchmen has always been political, so if you're not interested in any political commentary then this isn't the show for you.
If you are interested, then the show is making great efforts to build in a real bond with the characters and has some interesting takes on society. I have the feeling that some of the people who are disappointed with this show may have not understood the point of Watchmen as a story about the cold war.<br/><br/>The cold war is over and the creators decided to expand the brand to make a story about modern society. Call it woke as much as you want, but if you complain about Watchmen having a political agenda... That's the point.<br/><br/>I really like the show so far (Episode 4). They have put some thought into the world after the events during the original comic series. The acting is good and the show doesn't insult it's audiences intelligence.<br/><br/>If you just want a retelling of the original, go watch Zach Snyder's movie. It's pretty good. I haven't read the comic, I have watched the 'moving comic' though and some of the characters are present in hints and in the flesh, so why trash the production ? I agree its a little slow in parts and the dialogue sparse, but thats the point - not to overshoot too soon, but to plant the seeds and watch the plot grow.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been paid to make this show, create stories, character arcs and the like and giving a bad score based on simple hate because its not blow by blow the comic, is just wrong - because you cloud others' views.<br/><br/>I personally love Adrian Ozy's character - he makes the show funny and a joy to watch - with laugh out loud moments, but also manic moments where you truely understand the lengths he will go to - to get what he wants - I wonder if he actually treated the clones with humanity,,he might be let out of his prison :) Look, I'm no watchmen fanboy (although I read the graphic novel twice) but I can rightfully say I know the source material quiet well. Is it the same as the novel? No. Why should it be? The same thing again, just a remake - who wants that? Does it deal with race and inequality? Yes, these seem to be strong currents running through the narrative of this iteration. Is it racist, race boating, leftist PC, Hollywood elite, the moon landing was fake, woke propaganda?!? No. It's a story that strongly reflects truths of our society and world that we live in. You feel confronted by it? You feel insulted as a white person? Quit being a snowflake and open your eyes to real fears millions of Americans live with EVERY DAY. Is the show a perfect ten out of ten? Not yet. Will it be unique, insightful, twisty, horrifying and beautifully shot and performed? Yes. All you butt pinched trolling nerdos need to take a breath. Oh yeah, and I guess cause it matters when reviewing this show, for the record I am a 31 year old white man! : ) I was told (and thankfully did) watch the Watchmen movie from 2009. I previously had no knowledge of this comic series. The movie did assist me understanding some of the backstory to new series of the same name. In fact, the series is set following a period of years after the events of the movie. But the series itself still seems to have its own plot. I thought the movie was mediocre. And I have yet to read anything else from the franchise. But the series has really caught my attention and I have been eagerly waiting for each new episode instalment. And the series seems to be going from strength to strength each week. Character development is brilliant as too the actors, the doubles, the writers, the graphics and the directing. Everything is working. Unfortunately, you will need to watch this series from episode one. And I recommend seeing the 2009 movie first. Sorry you got tricked !!
Mysterious and difficultly understandable in the begining, the show is going deeper and deeper in a dark and very Watchmen's style plot !
Multiple levels of watching in the story, inside the story itself make the show intense and psycothic af...
If Watchmen still on this direction, I think we are wittnessing one or the very best show of the year!!
Acting is incredible. (Jeremy Irons and Tim Blake Nelson are outstandding)
I'm french sorry for the possible mistakes in my sentences. I like the fact it's not a simplistic script. It's definitely a slow pot-boiler and who knows where it's heading but I'm hooked so far. Good acting all round and a great piece of glorious ham for Jeremy Irons who looks like he's enjoying himself immensely ! Stick with it people ! I never write reviews, but I couldn't help but notice most of the negative reviews on here were written during the first or second episode. Which to me, in hindsight, was shortsighted and reactionary. Just finished the fifth episode and the show has blossomed into the most intriguing, mind bending, well acted, and "watchmen" series you could ask for. So take a chance, and ignore all the short sighted people on here. It's freaking fabulous and just keeps getting better. Absolutely awful. Has nothing to do with the watchmen, just used the name and brand to get people to watch this terrible show. Unfortunately, they couldn't even make one good episode for the pilot to at least hook a couple people. Do not bother. Amazing world building. Solid storytelling. Great characters.
The best show running on TV right now. Clearly a many (white) people are rattled by the honest take on racism and brutality in this show. IMDB should also check on the fake accounts directed to drive down the ratings of this show, which have happened to other shows as well dealing with the similar race issues.
Overall, I am glad HBO decided to make this show. It is one of the very best I have seen from them mere two episodes in. Great work. First off, IGNORE the very angry trolls. They are  people can't stand the truth. Within 5 seconds of watching this, i knew it would anger them, and for obvious reasons, The show doesn't is unapologetic in the way it puts forward issues. It's a great watch, well made, riveting and true to the tone of Alan Moore's work. Very recommended Selective facts from The Tulsa riots of 1921 to alternate reality, "Trump style dystonia future". The writers lay on the white guilt and moral preaching thick from the get go. If you enjoy being manipulated by yet another product of socialist anti white, anti American propaganda, then this is for you, if your tired of it, give it a miss. A lot of people have been giving this show bad reviews, mostly based on the pilot episode. Many of them are fans of the source material who think this new take on the Watchmen universe is ruining the characters and events from the comic with political messages and a liberal bias. As a Watchmen fan myself, I believe the exact opposite.<br/><br/>The original Watchmen, like many of Alan Moore's works, was more than just a superhero story. What set it apart was it's examination of the psychology of masked vigilantism and how these heroes' presence affects the greater world. The new Watchmen does the exact same thing, but rather than dealing with the now outdated fear of nuclear holocaust, it focuses on an issue more politically relevant to today: racism and discrimination. Anyone who complains that the new show is too political has clearly missed the political messages presented by the comic. Dr. Manhattan is a political tool used by the US government to scare the Russians, Rorschach is extremely right wing, and Adrien Veidt is a liberal socialite who orchestrates his grand plan specifically to create the leftist America that this new series is set in. What Lindelof is exploring is how the legacy of these characters would play into a more modern setting, and he does so masterfully. Rorschach's moral absolutism and right-wing values make him an obvious idol for white supremacists, especially with the publishing of his journal revealing the alien squid attack to have been orchestrated by the liberal Veidt. And the world of "Redfordations" and a strong, liberal government would come naturally from Veidt's plan to end the Cold War.<br/><br/>Many negative reviews I read seem mostly concerned that the show is too left-leaning, depicting a liberal utopia and painting all conservatives as white supremacists. I find this to be not true. Like the comic, the show depicts more than a good vs. evil story. It is morally-gray, exploring the flawed aspects of both sides of the conflict. The show condemns racism and discrimination, but also makes it clear that the police's response is problematic as well. It follows in the footsteps of the source's depiction of the various heroes and their ideologies, each with their positives and negatives.<br/><br/>The new Watchmen series is delightfully complex, controversial, and messy- all good things that can also be said about the original. It's a very different setting than the one originally introduced to comic book fans, but there is no doubt this is still the world of Watchmen. It is filled with clever references and homages to the source material, while also creating compelling new characters and storylines. This is not the old Watchmen, but it is a stunning tribute to the world and story created by Moore and Gibbons, and I look forward to where Lindelof and this amazing cast and crew chooses to take this series next. The first 2 episodes left me baffled<br/><br/>Directing is amazing 10/10. The way this is shot is really high class. I loved small touches like Jeremy Irons "tomato tree" scene, which described his character so well (especially if you go back to and contemplate after episode end). There are many great touches that are used to portray the characters. Such level of detail is really rare.<br/><br/>On the other hand characters themself are so primitive its almost as watching a cartoon. If cop is bad he is KKK, if cop is a hero he bakes children cakes in his free time (literally)
And then Ozymandias character. In the movie I could relate to him in a sense. I mean he did terrible things but he was still doing it for the greater good. Even as villain he was likable. In this show? Hes Hitler.<br/><br/>Also there's too much woke in this show. I personally felt its a bit over the top. I wish there was more shades of grey rather than black and white. This must be the dimension juicy smollett lives in cause it's no where near reality. But sure, blame white Christians for being 13% of the population committing 52% of all crime in the US. Once I understood that, several scenes made more sense to me such as the raining squid.<br/><br/>This series starts out a little bit slow but halfway into the second episode things just start clicking into place.<br/><br/>Jeremy Irons appears to be the perfect person to play the aging Adrian Veidt. Keep an eye on his two assistants, nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>The history that we missed between the ending of the comic book and the beginning of the show unravels itself through the episodes of this series, so at first we don't know what the hell is going on but little by little we get a picture of what exactly happened.<br/><br/>By the time episode three comes around, be prepared for a familiar person (but not face) to join the show.<br/><br/>The big mystery is exactly who does Lou Gossett Junior represent here? And that is another story that unravels as each episode goes by.<br/><br/>Don't understand the negative reaction to this, this is done very well.<br/><br/>We also get to see the return of a familiar vehicle that a certain watchmen used to fly around. But that is not the only gadget in this series.<br/><br/>in a way, this show parallels what is happening in this country right now except to a more pronounced degree. Ghod help us if it ever gets as bad as this, we will need masked vigilantes. I wonder if the people who are giving 1 and 2 star reviews have even seen the whole episode.....its like they want this show to fail so bad they'll go to any depths to make sure it happens. I saw some so called reviews saying that this show is not a faithful adaptation....This isn't an adaptation...it's a sequel (facepalms). Also explain to me how is this an SJW show? Its ironical because this show is set in a time where the government has been liberal for the last 3 decades and how it has had its own adverse effects.
Now to the actual review....after having read the comic and seeing the film....I can say this show has really given justice to the Watchmen universe. There are various plots at play. The acting is top notch. The subtle nods to the original comic are always welcome .All in all its a great start to what I think is gonna be one the best shows of 2019.As Adrien Veidt says,"It's only just begun". This show is rockin so far. Love it. You will too<br/><br/>I promise you that This show is terrible when did the characters in the comics become black I must have missed it one season and done not soon enough another social justice crap productions I don't usually write reviews. This is my first one, but honestly I can't understand why this show has such a low rating. Possibly because of purist fanboys but seriously, ignore and watch this show! Incredible writing and the characters and attention to detail make this one of the best shows of the year, so far. This is great filmmaking and I'm hooked. This is essentially a sequel to the comic book series, 34 years later. Tulsa, Oklahoma is a hot bed of a race conflict. The police wear masks to hide their identity after many were assassinated by white supremacist group, the Seventh Kavalry. Police detective Angela Abar (Regina King) has the secret identity Sister Night. She becomes entangled by various conspiracies centering on the omnipotent Doctor Manhattan.<br/><br/>Damon Lindelof has created an amazing sequel to the iconic DC Comics series. It is inventive and respectful of the original. I love what they did with the Rorschach mask. It's indicative of how movements can confiscate images without doing an insightful dive into the man's ideas. The misappropriation is the perfect example of Lindelof's brilliance. The characters, the reveals, and the plot turns are all superb. Apparently, this is an one-off but future additions are possible. Looking for things to watch I stumbled onto Watchmen. I remembered the trailer and thinking it looked interesting but weird. After a couple episodes not knowing what the heck was going on, it ended up being one of the best shows I've seen in recent memory. A Very poor effort.
In trying to update the story to the modern day,
the writers, director and all involved have completely destroyed everthing that was brilliant about the original Watchmen universe.
Don't waste your time - this series is far too politically motivated,
read the comics, watch the original movie.
Whatever you do, aviod this disaster like the plague. I was waiting for this.. expected so much more.. what did i just watch ? i dont know if i want to continue watching this series..watching first episode i dont expect we will have something what fans was waiting for... disappointed A rich and worthy follow-up to Moore and Gibbons's masterpiece. The characters are deep and wonderful performances from the principle cast drive the story. It's unique soundtrack is a perfect compliment to the tone and atmosphere of the show. While the opening scene is a powerhouse start, it then slows down quickly. DO NOT be deterred!!! The first four episodes are a vital setup and the payoff well be worth it. Bizarre...good? Not so sure. but for outright weird I think there's a strange hook. That said it's a stretch to use Sci-Fi as political commentary so the story itself must be compelling at least kind of like Episode IV in a good vs. evil theme. It's unapologetic in using racism even calling up the Nazi card. It's too steeped in Sci-Fi to be a mirror of true social injustice and it's too indulgent in it's need to be both shocking and bizarre. As such it fails to make a case for anything other than look how we got a big network to give us a big budget to do things no one else dares. You might just keep watching for a kind of shock, and, somehing being as ugly as it can. There are some good performances that I believe keep it from being the disaster it fearlessly teeters on. Just this week, after the final episode of the season aired, an NPR segment of the best TV series of 2019 included it - even saying it would likely return for another season. That means bizarre can be good enough. A hook as strange as the show itself recalling the old saying "in for a penny, in for a pound" begrudged commitment to keep with it. Even so I'm scratching my head as to what I've seen and why? Very creative filming and story telling here. It's taking a lot of modern day issues like racism and police brutality and turning it on it's head. Almost mocking them. I think most of the people giving bad reviews aren't keeping an open mind and cant get past their bias on the topic to see how they're really taking it on.<br/><br/>Some have had difficulty following the story, but I'm not finding that at all. If you're not used to flashbacks and can't follow stories where you figure things out along with the characters in it, then maybe you'll find this difficult. I think it's all well executed<br/><br/>There's also a lot of criticism saying this has nothing to do with the original Watchmen. I'm only 2 episodes are out as I'm writing this, but slowly there is more and more reference to the original Watchmen. As the story unravels I suspect those characters will reveal themselves. Especially, Mr Manhattan.<br/><br/>
So far I'm loving this! I mean seriously how does this have anything in common with the comic?
Also the race bating is just insulting There is no doubt in my mind after reading the comments that the entire worlds biased opinion is for sale. Everything is so fake now it makes my head spin.
This is everything from the simplest .10c item to the most expensive item on earth. Reviews are bought, plain and simple.
Every form of entertainment has now been taken over as a political platform and it is sickening.
"They" are gonna learn the hard way that the people that are the most aggravated about this are the people that spend the most money. There are only so many movie stars (puppets for sale).<br/><br/>WITHOUT US there are no movie stars (puppets)! True in spirit to the movie and graphic novel, going by the dialog it follows the end of the novel and not the movie, nods to the minute men and to the watchmen abound. Recommended for fans and newcomers (you may have some trouble getting all the litle details) Yes this show is confusing and it may not hold true to the comics but it's very interesting. This show is a look at a different timeline than our own bring in racial and police issues making it very topical and fascinating to watch. I will concede that if this show does not give answers by the end it will get a vet different rating Yet another tv series ruined by revolting violence (i lasted up to the point where an entire herd of cows was blown apart by guns) and constant foul language , don't watch it if you have any sense of decency It is wonderful series. It is actually made for people who haven't seen the movie or read the book. But it stays faithful to the comics.
There are only few characters from the movie which is logical because it is a sequel so it doesn't need all characters.<br/><br/>Through the episode we see that there is a one big theme that will play out for the season. And as I see in comments lot of people hate it. I don't understand that Racial problem has been around for centuries and as we see in the public it hasn't gone away. So I don't think it is a bad idea to include in the series.<br/><br/>There is no reason for all the hate. So I ask please stop giving bad score and don't ruin the watching experience for other people! As a person who is 1. Not a democrat sjw type 2. But is very proud of Anglo-Scandi Heritage one might think I'd be gnashing my teeth likes the trolls posting their faux reviews on here.<br/><br/>Nope. Enjoyed both episodes so far and give it a 10 as a nice spit in the eye to trolls.<br/><br/>This show isn't some genocidal screed to kill whitey. But low brow racist types are in a angry fervor over it.<br/><br/>The same types who complain that others want to outlaw freedom of speech.
You can't have it both ways people.
Either everyone gets to express themselves freely in America or no one does.<br/><br/>I already knew about the horrors of Tulsa in 1921 and honestly what was shown is much more tepid than the insanity that went down.<br/><br/>It wasn't solely about race, the destruction of Black Wall Street was also about class lines. Poor whites ignored their better angels and acted like greedy demons.
And no one is saying Black Wall Street was perfect either, there was plenty of drugs, gangs and bad dealings going on in some parts.<br/><br/>Anyone who can't calmly watch this show with an open mind is a manchild.
Grow pair and watch it before writing up faux reviews.<br/><br/>If nothing else Trent Reznor's score is tight. Thank you for one of the best pilot episodes I've ever seen! Regina King is just incredible. She is wickedly skilled as a bad-ass and still has a soft side that I first saw in "Ray" some years ago. I can't wait for the next episode! Woke and race and no surprise no one likes it wow not surprised really not worth your time if anybody rated this high they are lying to you I mean the boys or umbrella academy your welcome saved you from really wasting your time. If you ever want to know what stupidity is, just read the negative reviews. Yes, I get that Watchmen is hallowed ground for Uber fans, but I think Lindeloff is doing a great job tying in past events and characters into a new story arch. Give it time before posting nonsense out of naive anger. This actually has quite a bit to do with Watchmen if people actually knew what they were talking about. It highlights the negative effects these "heroes," leave on the world. It shows the human nature of heroes who think they did what was best for society, and it shows the aftermath of these things.<br/><br/>Rorschach is involved because his very troubled and disgusting ideology is the villain in this show. It drives the existent antagonists completely.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that so many people are getting upset that show highlights backwards ideology as a villain. It is a villain, and again it was a part of Rorschach's ideology so it makes sense. Stop being so sensitive. There is nothing liberal about this show, at all. It is extremely screwed up and that is one of the reasons why I love it.<br/><br/>It makes you feel uncomfortable. There are a lot of loose ends, there are a lot of questions. My only hope is that they actually tie them together in a climactic way.<br/><br/>Also it can feel like there are too many stories at once sometimes. Everyone has something to hide or they leave with unanswered questions. This is where patience, rewatching, or talking the show over with someone else comes into play. Just finished episode 3. The series is shaping up well - good character development and a compelling plot - Jeremy Irons is amazing!<br/><br/>Bad reviews based off first episode don't make any sense to me. People seem to think theres some kind of hollywood undertone liberal agenda - frankly, I couldn't care less. Its an interesting and well shot show.<br/><br/>Lets hope the rest of the season keeps getting better. Did the people responsible for this even watch the film / read the comic? As much a link between the original and this series as between Jaws and Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (both feature an important fish). Passing mention to Doc Manhattan in a desperate attempt to keep fans on board but making Rorschach the bad guy? Come on! Two episodes in I'll keep watching as I subscribed for the month to the OCS channel especially, but I hold out no hope for an improvement, or rather, realignment. It's as off course as a round the world yacht sailing up and down the Hudson River. I honestly think part of the reason this show has an influx of bad reviews is because of the content and the afrocentric setting. This version of "Watchmen" was never supposed to be directly directly graphic novel, though there's still references and characters from the graphic novel. People who are complaining about this either chose to ignore this fact or they need to do more research before viewing a show based on comic books/books. They also probably feel personally called out by the blatant bigotry in this show and this subconsciously makes them feel attacked; and powerful black characters are probably threatening to their world view. Watch it for yourself and form your own opinion first. Another great idea absolutely butchered by radical leftist politics. Couldn't be more disappointed. Last 3 episodes are amazing. Need to have patience. Well its a slow and weird start. Thats why people vote 1-5 after 1-2 episodes. Be patience, some episodes in and you are HOOKED. Just watched episode 6. Darn I love this serie! I almost dropped this one after the first two episodes, GLAD I DIDNT. My taste of seriers are Stranger Things, The Outsider, GOT, Sherlook Holmes, FARGO, The Witcher, The Dark, The Mandalorian and so on. If u like my taste, GO SEE IT AND HOLD OUT! So so good! I can't wait to see where this goes! So much potential. I love that it's not just a straight repeat of the film and it shouldn't be! Not what I was expecting but it is enjoyable. Takes place after the watchmen movie so I'm not expecting to see the original watchmen characters just have to see how it plays out. Now I will say from the beginning I never read the comics so I am not sure how accurate this is. My only knowledge of the watchmen is from the movie which to be fare was not the best.<br/><br/>However this show has great writing, riveting story, great acting, enough twists to make it interesting and above all else twists you didn't see coming.<br/><br/>One more thing I loved...too many movies nowadays try to give a political massage but they fail because they get lost in the massage itself and forget to care about the story. Not this one, this is how you do it..deliver a powerful massage hidden behind an interesting story.<br/><br/>Also the cinematography behind this was amazing, images and scenes are shot perfectly, soundtracks are great, its not too stretched, characters are interesting and it has just enough mysterious vibe to it.<br/><br/>So yea, highly recommended, watch it and enjoy. I hope it will not be ruined in the future seasons. Episode 1 was pure garbage. 2 was a little better. 3 and 4 were decent, and then it just got worse and worse. That wasn't Watchmen in any meaningful way. Sure, there were a few similar story threads and a couple of characters that were in the phenomenal comic series. But that's about it. While it wasn't horrible as a TV pilot, it was horrible as an adaptation of the Watchmen comic. I always love Regina King and some of the other actors are great. But this wasn't Watchmen to my mind.<br/><br/>It's obvious that the creators of the series wanted to do something original and felt they couldn't do that within the constraints of the original comic like the (less than phenomenal) movie. It's also clear they wanted this to have parallels to where we currently are in society and a where things may be headed. Maybe if this wasn't meant to be Watchmen and had a different name I would enjoy it more. But as a devotee I can't really recommend the series. Having said that, there are plenty of people who will like it, find it entertaining and worth their time. It wasn't bad by any measure. Just not what I was expecting or hoping for in the end. Look I think people forget this is a tv show not a movie they can't just jump straight into it they need to build it up, build characters build a god dam story! It is Continued from the movie.
I honestly have found it so great! The real world there isn't "super hero's" everyone has a darkest in them and that's why I love watchmen! I find it interesting that the profiles of the vast majority of the negative reviewers have this as their only review. If they have any others, those reviews are also full of words like propaganda and political correctness. Ignore these trolls. Either they never actually read the book, or they were too dense to understand it. Rorschach was not some great hero to be idolized. Watchmen was always quite left leaning and highly critical of people like Ayn Rand.<br/><br/>Watchmen reminds me more and more of The Leftovers the deeper I get into it, and that's not a bad thing. Like the novel, it explores what makes people who they are and muddies the waters of good and evil. Both novel and series have characters that view the world rigidly in terms of absolute black and white, but it shows us a world in shades of gray. I'm very curious to see what happens with Ozymandias. I think some of the online theories are correct, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Dr. Manhattan show up soon. Also, the music is great, though I'll admit I'm biased as a big Nine Inch Nails fan. Halfway through this worthless trash, I've given up. I'm still trying to find the connection with the great graphic novel (this is not a sequel to the movie). Other than a few names being dropped - there's none. This is diatribe written by SJW, trying to cram their agenda down the viewers throats. It's dull most of the time and wasting a fine cast. I've given up on it and won't be watching anymore. Trash. Ignore the cry baby closet racists that moan about anything slightly liberal this was decent and has potential to be a really good show It's Watchmen. Of course it's political.<br/><br/>But more than that it's a daring new chapter in one of the greatest comic universes ever created. Unique new characters, an intriguing new mystery and a painterly eye for detail elevate this reboot and solidify it as the next must-watch series of the year. I think too many people are expecting too many things out of these comic book programs. This is a very entertaining, action-packed, good acting, thought-provoking drama.
I can not remember the comics anymore, been to long, but this take on it reminds me of the feel from The Dark Knight Batman series with Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Not a critic, but tired of interesting intellectual programs not making it. All because "we" think we know how the movie or program should go.
Sometimes it is nice to let someone else tell the same story a different way.. Its weird in a bad way. Its not for everyone, for sure and it wasn't for me. In my opinion its another franchise "destroyed" by so called "visionary" television and "bold" writers. Overhyped stuff. This series does a great job at showing what happens in the Watchmen universe in 2019. The repercussions of everything in the comic are delightfully drawn out to logical conclusions. What happened exactly isn't bluntly piled on the viewer. Instead, one should pay attention to details in the background like posters hanging on a classroom wall or kids practicing the order of presidents.<br/><br/>You do not need to be familiar with the comic to enjoy this series, but there are payoffs if you are versed in the original. I see complaints from other reviews about it not being related to Watchmen and not being able to understand. Here are a few points that I think help. First, this is set 34 years after the original Watchmen. Second, this is based off the comic book, not the movie. I love the movie, but it understandably needed to make a major change to the ending. This is why there are squid references in the show. Next, Rorshach sent his journal to an Infowars type of publication at the end of the comic. It makes sense that he would become a hero for the type of people that use his mask in the series. Finally, the comic mentions Robert Redford's ambitions for running for president. After decades of conservative Nixon rule it would make sense for a large pendulum shift to liberal policies under Redford. The show does great work in taking all of these dynamics from the comic and running with them. After the incredible show that is called Leftovers, I didn't doubt for a second that Lindelof would knock it out of the park again with his new series Watchmen.<br/><br/>Watchmen is intriguing, mysterious and suspenseful. The acting is solid, the writing is great and the cinematography is beautiful. It must have something going for it. While not totally hooked yet, it's certainly not as bad as all of the bad reviews would indicate. It started nicely with the Tulsa massacre/riot depiction and is building enough storyline to keep me coming back. The production values are typical HBO (a positive) but the character development is somewhat lacking in the first 2 episodes.<br/><br/>It probably requires more patience than many are capable of. I am not American and I can not possibly understand racism as well as an American would, so to me it is another good series about one half of people hating other half on some ideas. I like characters, rorschach mask wearing terrorists look intimidating and police with masked officers look real and capable.<br/><br/>Regina King (Night Sister) kicks ass. That is one of the best female action hero portrayals ever. I am not sure about supporting cast though. Night Sisters husband looks fake and that rorschachian looking dude with shiny face has to convince me to like him too.<br/><br/>Cinematography is good and you will be blown away by some shot transitions too. Production value and long term survivability of this show is also evident. It will be hard to keep this level of quality up for a long time. Lets hope if will be worth our time.<br/><br/>As a fan of the movie, I will say that this is definitively watchmen, but not the ones from 80-ies chasing nuclear war threat. These are modern ones, the ones that we will or are supposed to care about. Watch the Watchmen. Leave to HBO to turn a potentialy great show into a fair one. Everyone has to take a side on politics and I hate that. Can we please just have a show without someone pushing an agenda for one side or the other? I really liked most of the episodes. But when I see blatent politics being pushed it takes a lot away for me. Just give me entertainment FFS! That was truly awesome ! An absolut perfect Pilotepisode !<br/><br/>People are just down-rating this because of the Racism-Aspect....thats sad<br/><br/>The Cast, The Story, The Visuals...... thats the TV i want !<br/><br/>Cant wait for the next episode ! This is HBOs next game of throne. It's filled with rich history and great well developed characters. The action the CGI THE COSTUMES the acting the cinematography everything about this show is amazing Unwatchable. Another race baiting show by Hollywood. Could barely get thru the first episode. Now I remember why I canceled HBO the first time. I don't normally rate shows based on one episode, but lately there's been so much outrage over anything and everything by the increasingly vocal group of aggrieved Internet trolls that I've been breaking my own rule more and more just to get in an early "screw you" to all the armchair critics out there. For what it's worth, the episode was great. For a start, treating an obvious incel inspiration such as Rorschach in a neutral fashion (even the neutral fashion of the "antihero") wouldn't really work today (even Alan Moore has come out and admitted that his 80s work is gratuitous and that it's basically aged badly, c.f. 'The Killing Joke'). Also, I feel like the outrage over the decision to set the story in a racially divided America is preemptive - from what I saw and then read after watching the episode, it appears that the divisions in the show's world are the result of this alternate history's very specific political developments (President Redford paying slavery reparations to America's black populace). Ultimately, there is little difference between this and a show like 'Man in the High Castle'. Oh, but that's Nazis and the Japanese, not white supremacists resembling what we have today. I guess you folks are able to draw some major difference from that.
Also, the 'Watchmen' comic book had its own anti-Reaganism/Thatcherism leanings, therefore it seems somewhat random when Internet-empowered fanboys complain about the show's politicization. I don't really like Alan Moore very much, but heck, he's always saying he doesn't want his stuff adapted, b/c it's so "unfilmable" as everyone keeps saying. Well, Lindelof didn't adapt, he extended. Would I have preferred a Damon Lindelof show with no Alan Moore connection? Sure. Do I still like the show? Well, based on one episode, it's looking good.<br/><br/>EDIT: And here's Moore's own pointed Rorschach quote: "I wanted to kind of make this like, 'Yeah, this is what Batman would be in the real world.' But I had forgotten that actually to a lot of comic fans that smelling, not having a girlfriend-these are actually kind of heroic. So actually, sort of, Rorschach became the most popular character in Watchmen. I meant him to be a bad example, but I have people come up to me in the street saying, 'I am Rorschach! That is my story!' And I'll be thinking, 'Yeah, great, can you just keep away from me and never come anywhere near me again for as long as I live?"<br/><br/>EDIT 2 (in response to the latest negative reviews reiterating the same arguments): JESUS, are you people even watching the show or is it that you're simply unable to revise your thinking after the first episode? It's clear that the cops aren't the good guys, and the excessively "woke" culture you're railing against is being questioned no less than white supremacy. It's beginning to look like the real reason you're taking offence is that it's not dumbed down enough for the age of radical partisanship. This show is absolutely amazing people are complaining yet we dont know where it's going Game of Thrones first episodes was confusing i never read the books but you have to let things grow. All these 1's on here Have issues with race being there white and there uncomfortable with the history of tusla in 1921 it actually happened. Another innocent unarmed black person was killed in there own home by the police another fact ...WACTH THE SHOW CAUSE ITS A GOOD SHOW maybe people are uncomfortable with the truth as a black man in real life how can i be uncomfortable with a show when i actually live in this place where im looked at as a criminal no matter where i work what i do how much money i make# facts i know The much-anticipated TV imagining of the respected Watchmen comic wanders around aimlessly. The show has an anthology feel about it as by the 7th episode there was no discernible plot or reason to keep watching., Frankly, its slightly pretentious and definitely boring at points.<br/><br/>I also noticed that there is a deliberate focus here on female characters. The primary protagonists throughout are females, typically occupying traditionally male roles - FBI agent, Worlds richest billionaire/trillionaire, super-hero etc. I found this to be interesting since it is an "alternate" universe, but sadly the plot structure is so disjointed alternating from dream sequences, time travel, monochrome, sepia, colour, etc and the plot underdeveloped that by the end of the 7th episode I don't know what is happening other than on a soap opera level.<br/><br/>The performances are good, the production as expected but the writing has failed to hold the attention. What is at stake? Why should we care?<br/><br/>The White Supremacy angle seems trite. I am not interested in that subject, thinking about it, imagining it, it seems like a strategic misstep by the writers. Fantasising about racial pogroms in America seems exploitative. Its cheap, easy lazy and unimaginative. As a fan of the graphic novel and to some extent the movie, this is not what I was expecting. I sat thru the pilot hoping to at least get an enjoyable show. Nope.
If you are a fan of the source material this is going to be a hard watch for you. This was just great from start to finish. It certainly had the feel of the watchmen universe and I love it was'nt just more watchmen with the same charecters. It takes place in the universe but it does'nt reuse old charecters for a few easy bucks. Im intrigued and will continue to watch. This isn't a sequel to that ok 2009 movie. This is a sequel to the graphic novel, the actual Watchmen. I liked the fact that they tried to create something new. Very good series that criticize norms and tell through fiction about what the US has problems with racism even after slavery. I didn't know about the real event about Tulsa in 1921 before this show came up. Fiction series like this are a smart tool for telling stories of everything that has happened or is happening in our cilivisation from a different perspective. I support this kind of perspective. By the way, the music was nice too.<br/><br/>Even if the Police force having mask and somethimes acting like a fascist cops beating up people in the serie... The serie is still needed against rascism.<br/><br/>
Thank you HBO and DC to make this possible. All other negative reviews are a sign that this serie is needed. This show just got off to an amazing start. Wow. And that opening scene -- POWERFUL!!
Great actors!! Have you seen the cast!? It's spectacular!! This is big budget, great cinematography and an interesting premise... and the music... it's done by Trent Reznor, for God's sake!!
I cannot wait to see what the second episode brings. For now, I'm ALL IN.<br/><br/>To the people using the excuse of this being "nothing like the comics," as an excuse to rate it down, for blatantly different reasons: this show is a direct continuation of Alan Moore's comics, not the Zack Snyder movie.
The Watchmen comics were highly political! Do your homework!<br/><br/>After seeing the second episode: jesus christ!! This show just does everything right! People who rated this down, are doing so because it's holding up a mirror, that they've spent a great deal of time hiding from:<br/><br/>White supremacists are FUMING!!<br/><br/>There's a YouTube video called "Watchmen: Rorschach's 7th Kavalry History Explained." If you're in the group of white people who are offended by the idea that a white supremacist terrorist entity would co-opt Rorschach's ideology then, you definitely need to watch this video. Rorschach was right-leaning, so it's not hard for him to be idolised by white supremacists and have his ideology twisted to fit their agenda. The comics were highly political, and anyone who read them would know this. This is part of what makes this show so great; it seamlessly picks up where the comics left off. The main character in the hands of someone without any type of charm.
Bad acting but the main thing is the main character. Do I know all that is going on? NO. Is there something special here? YES. Powerful and full on intrigue... great acting and action. Hooked for sure. Highly recommended....as one episode finishes can't wait to watch another. Always a good sign. Enjoy I was scepticL at first. But every episode is better then it's predecessor Let me start out by discussing the politics so far. Are people really upset that this show includes white supremacists? Come on, white supremacy exists in the real world, yet you are going to critique a TV show for handling the matter? There is nothing divisive about the politics of this show. It isn't left leaning, PC, or a snowflake show, because to state such would be arguing that white supremacy isn't in of itself dangerous and wrong. And no this does not marginalise white people or attack them. Most of the police force (good guys) is, surprise, white.<br/><br/>Exploring discrimination is not political, its a discussion of history.<br/><br/>In terms of the actual show. The cinematography is absurdly good, like some of the best ever shots on TV. The score is marvellous. At times, this feels like a more indie flick than a HBO show, and its great. The writing is great, feels a lot like Westworld. Its sophisticated and enchanting.<br/><br/>Acting is absurdly good. Regina King is a great lead, but Jeremy Irons and Jean Smart steal this show. They are perfectly cast and steal every scene they are in.<br/><br/>The only negative about this show is that it is too reliant on assuming that the audience is already familiar with Alan Moore's graphic novel. There needed to be an establishing sequence at the beginning to explain to the audience why the squids are falling from the sky, how Vietnam became an U.S. state, and, most importantly, this is set in an alternate timeline. To assume everyone knows this, is to alienate most of the audience.<br/><br/>Also, to anyone saying this is too slow, what did you expect? There isn't five seasons of build up and this takes place after the events of the graphic novel. Don't expect anything until the later parts of the season when they can build off of the foundation they lay in the first half of the season - you know like most TV shows. Otherwise just wait until Dec. 15 and binge the show.<br/><br/>The End is Nigh. There are many negative reviews to try and drag this show down (whatever). This is a brilliant well written, cast and directed series that has me captivated. I am looking forward to see the direction this show is leading. Most shows are politically driven. (Watch)men for yourselves. I feel we are in the golden age of television right now. It started with OZ, THe Sopranos and The Wire. It's hard to top The Wire. This pilot was engaging and so well put together. It was shot so beautifully. Don Johnson was just amazing. He has become such a good actor. There is a great reference to "Silence of the Lambs" when he starts singing "people will say we are in love". Yes he does sing and it blocked out moving around around this round dining room table. There are some really great edits in it as well. There is an edit that is so well executed I actually gasped. It reminded me of the worlds greatest edit which, of course, is in Lawrence of Arabia, when he blows out the match and it turns into the desert sun. I could watch that edit all day. Anyway, the Trent Renzor score is jaw dropping, the acting is off the charts great. The writing is sublime and intricate. You're not going to be able to miss an episode of it that's for sure. I love television that is challenging. The only thing I wish it had was more of the original characters. I was really looking forward to the re-thinking of the Comedian and Dr. Manhattan etc. My favorite character in the movie was Rorshak and now he's the bad guy(s)? I don't get it. That fact is kind of a bummer. I have to admit I did not read the comic so that's probably why my unvarnished view is so positive.I am a huge fan of the movie. I think it was the best movie that came out that year. I've seen it a dozen times at least. People are all excited about Marvel stories but DC nailed it with WATCHMEN. It might be the best comic book idea ever. This show is incredibly well acted, produced, and written.<br/><br/>While some people have complained about it not relating to the source material, I don't think those comments have much merit. The original takes place in New York while this show takes place 30 years in the future of the graphic novel in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Some have complained that the show is too political, anti-conservative, and too racial. I wonder if those individuals ever really read the comic, as it was very political for its time too. The writer of the graphic novel, Alan Moore, even started that he wrote the story to be anti-Reaganism, and Reagan is essentially THE template for modern day conservatives. Moore also stated that he was making conscious decisions to make people uncomfortable regarding the themes presented.<br/><br/>Moore also said, "Our intention was to show how superheroes could deform the world just by being there, not that they'd have to take it over, just their presence there would make the difference... From the point where Dr. Manhattan appears, it slowly starts to go downhill from there - everything starts to change. He doesn't take over the country or make people subservient to him, but just his presence there makes everything begin to change. Yet on another level, if you equate Dr. Manhattan with the atom bomb, the atom bomb doesn't take over the world, but by being there it changes everything."<br/><br/>So in that spirit, HBO's Watchmen is on target with the tone and general themes of the original Watchmen. Some reviews have lamented Rosarch's depiction as a white supremacist. He's NOT. His journal being left out in the wild sans the author leaves behind a world that interprets his writings in their own way. By introducing the truth into the world without the author, the readers have gone in their own direction with it. And it goes wrong... just like Alan Moore stated things do in the original Watchmen.<br/><br/>I don't really understand people who complain about accurate depictions of racism or politics in comic book adjacent media, especially alleged comic books fans. Complaints about "woke" culture and "SJWs" seems silly when we've had characters and stories that have ALWAYS addressed these kinds of themes. Would these same reviewers hate the X-Men because the story is allegorical to racism and/or disenfranchisement of people in society who aren't WASPs? Would they hate Marvel's original Civil War now because it calls out fascism?<br/><br/>At any rate, the show is phenomenal and has been an absolute joy as so much is introduced but not explained as of yet. It is engaging and enthralling and the callbacks and Easter eggs to the graphic novel are liberally sprinkled throughout. Shed the "woe is me" mindset of some white viewers (and honestly, unless you're a white supremacist, there's no reason to feel attacked while you watch) and enjoy! Yes, there are actual horrific historic events that are shown, but how is that any different from X-Men showing young Magneto during the holocaust? Those who are triggered these days by hearing stories told from other groups besides white people really should grow up and realize the World is complex and varied. This is what makes comics so great!<br/><br/>I've been inspired to re-read the graphic novel as a result of the show and I really can't recommend it enough!<br/><br/>10/10 to balance out the insecure, biased, unmerited reviews that keep popping up (reviews are opinion, so it is nice when someone like myself offers a challenge based upon accuracy rather than isolated perspective). Ignore the trolls, especially those that use the word 'woke' as an adjective, what you think your clever? Muppets. This show is shaping up to be every bit as good as the movie and almost up there with the original graphic novel. It's dark and uses sensitive and controversial subject matters just as the original did. If you insist of using terms like 'woke' please find your nearest educational establishment and book yourself in for an English lesson. Also check the ids on the negative reviews and you'll see most are fake users, bought reviews. ...Is to not respect the mask and the true identity. In any given episode, you get regina king pulling down her mask at LEAST 3-4 times.<br/><br/>It gets old after the first one, and ruins the scene after the 10th. Keep the mask on, or take it off. End of story Know it's fiction, also know this is a great show (so I've heard) But the execution of cows (even if fiction) was unnecessary and made me stop at episode one. For the love of God why have that scene in the first place?! It is Watchmen....it's the Watchmen universe 30 years on. Once you get over that, it's great. This is actually an entertaining tv show but of course you have those sensitive types that hate all shows that depict anything with race, politics etc even if it is fictional. This is not a documentary and newsflash, race and politics exist in life. This show is more than that and I suggest you judge it for yourself. I am on episode 4 and can't wait to see what happens next. This show has the potential to be amazing.<br/><br/>Anyone slating it as having nothing to do with the "comic book" need to stop writing reviews.<br/><br/>There are so many threads already that you can tell that the writers have put thought into the "universe" (to borrow from a popular comic book term).<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, the soundtrack is banging, the visuals are awesome and the story (so far) has several hooks into what is essentially a murder mystery that you know is not going to go the way you think or necessarily want.<br/><br/>There's lots of "weird" aspects but you know from the writers (and the source material "prequels") that they will frame a picture into a world that is not that far from the one we live in.<br/><br/>I just hope it continues down this path, HBO should back it to the hilt, it's now down to writers to go their own way and not get caught up in re-hashing, re-telling or conforming. Im at episode 4 and the show keeps getting better and better the more parts of the puzzle you get. Great cast and Regina King is awesome and hot.<br/><br/>All the negative troll reviews must be some with some kind of an agenda or people who are used to getting spoon fed when watching movies and series without having to think themselves. Watchmen is bad. Really bad. Worse than I thought possible. It contains absolutely none of the intellectual and thought provoking dialogue similar to Alan Moore's Watchmen. It's purely "tough guy" avengers style libidinous action.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A 110 pound female cop beats the crap out of countless 200+ pound male opponents throughout the movie. Then cue the excessive and hugely exaggerated white supremacy, etc. etc... Total waste of time. Don't expect a version of watchmen because it's not watchmen, it is set 30+ years later. It is dark, gritty and engrossing. I'm not sure what other people mean by it's too political.
It's showing you a distopian future where the political landscape is very polarized.
I think that's very similar to the original watchmen!<br/><br/>Also love that they put in the some of the true history around the tulsa masacare. So, I am a fan of both the comics and the movie (though, the movie might have made a better mini-series, just because there was SO much story) and I think this show is a good story set in the after effects of the comics. The main three criticisms of the show seem to be the themes about race, it's connections to the original and the pacing.<br/><br/>As someone who is neither bothered by, nor thrives on the topic of race, I think the Kalvary is a scary, interesting nemesis, and their ideology being tied to Rorschach is really cool. It doesn't really seem political to me that their motivation is about race. That's not saying the show doesn't wade into political debates. While it has a slight liberal slant (but that's 90% of Hollywood, not saying it's right, but I think we can all agree on that) it is Watchmen and it's supposed to be challenging points on both sides. But I didn't think it discredited concerns on the right at all. It treated them thoughtfully, and in scenes like the "Lettuce Scene", showed the inconvenient realities of something like gun control for law enforcement.<br/><br/>For the connections to the original, I think this show lives in the world well, but it is a new story from a new perspective. I love the original characters but I kind of like them playing the role of "relics of old" for now, with Dr. Manhattan as a god like figure that could descend at any moment. (and if you like the original comics, watch this for no other reason than Jeremy Irons playing a delightfully crazy, older Ozymandias). They still feel present and integral to the story but allow us to concentrate on different things. I do miss the presence of a "team", but it's only the 2nd episode and that might be very well where they are going with it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the story does jump around a lot and give us a lot of loose threads to keep track of. While I like that we aren't given all the information upfront (that makes for good rewatches that add new context and make the show more immersive), sometimes it can feel jarring and difficult to keep track of. This definitely feels like one story in 8 parts and not 8 different stories.<br/><br/>And just to make sure it's said, I don't know what show some people are watching when they say the acting isn't good, but Regina King is killing it. Some of the other characters do still need to be fleshed out, but even episode 2 took the Mary-Sue-esque character of Judd and turned it inside out.<br/><br/>I'm excited to see where the show goes, how they're going to incorporate more elements from the original and answer some of the really cool questions they've asked. Every episode doesn't encapsulate every piece of Watchmen, but it's enough to feel like a continuation without being redundant. It's not like the movie but still great serie...
I just watched the first five episode but i liked it very much .music is also very good with the scene I started reading watchmen in high school in the 80's. This is an interesting take it's nostalgic in that the expectations and experience of watching the show reminds me of the 'comic,.
While the show has a more or less contemporary feel , considering it's alternative history, the satire delivers a very dark poke in the ribs to those showing up with expectations. It also does well nodding to the original.
I am looking foreword to seeing how this turns out and to finding out what others think of this so far. It is difficult to judge considering there are 2 episodes so far and the universe may throw some watchmen fans off ,but to me, all of the ingredients are there, it's like a show within a show and that's what makes it special.<br/><br/>Update: wow guys - the positive reviews are very positive and the negative are from fans stating that this isn't watchmen, I am confused? How can one make such a call 2 episodes in and to me, this IS Watchmen I guess you had to be there.
Update 5 episodes in. I wish the people who have it poor reviews during the first episode waited until now at least. This is how we lost terminator cannon to nostalgic covers. The fact that the show's ratings have been intentionally dragged down confirms the message that it delivers. Such an amazing show and people crying about it because it either doesn't conform to their ideas or they perceive it to be too politically motivated. Regardless of the negative ratings, this is probably one of the best shows out there. On many different facets I/we may be seeing an alternative form of storytelling. After episode 2, (Martial Comanche Horsemanship), it seems we have what may be our Protagonist (Regina King) ensconsced in the trappings of her DEEPLY held beliefs that she is on the prevailing side of righteousness in a Totalitarian society. So far we have seen this Superwoman battle criminals who have not only invaded her home, her way of life, her family and friends only to meet her Biological father who has just planted a seed of doubt of 'What If' EVERYTHING she was led to believe in society is wrong. From the ways of being raised to KNOW right from wrong to fighting for her perceived brand of JUSTICE as Sister Knight in this alternate universe.
Her character Angela Abar is coming into focus as Director/Creator Damon Lindelhof bit by bit seems to be building a wider worldview of a Totalitarian Estate and its affects on a society split between the Haves/Have Nots where Rorschach vigilantes give rise to other factions in this fractured Earth with its own set of laws not governed by a universe we know.<br/><br/>We may even be being drip-feed the impetus of the hows/whys of the forming of the Minutemen, could they possibly be another of many cadres of case solvers or be a post Minutemen scenario that is gently enticing us ep. by ep. Story build up. Character introduction. Atmosphere. Pace. Casting. Amazing!
This is masterpiece but to be honest if one of the above mentioned segments failed the whole thing fails. But it's not. The end result is tv series for grown ups who are not trump centered idiots. Visually stunning with an equally impressive score from Trent Reznor.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the people say it's not like the comic...no, it's not. But that's not a bad thing either. It's original it's intriguing. The show is amazing. Too bad conservatives get butthurt by a show that shows white supremacists in negative light. This show exposes the true side of modern conservatism. Can't believe how awesome this show is, just better and better every episode! It's a MUST watch!! I've never written a review before but felt the need after reading some of the others for this episode.
The editing alone in this show is Emmy worthy with subtle and beautiful transitions between past present and everything in between.
Purists may not like the idea of hooded justice being a black man but I think it's perfect for the series and the comics.
If you haven't watched the show I can't recommend it enough please give it a go you never know what you're going to get. First episode had some issues, I was disappointed, the writing was really weak. But I gave it two more chances - may be it's not that bad. After 3rd episode I can tell for sure - it is that bad.<br/><br/>If you take away "Watchmen" from this tv show you are left with weak writing and unoriginal story filled with plot holes. Is Dr.Manhattan being on Mars enough for you to watch this show? If it is, then watch away.<br/><br/>It was not for me. Let's see the original: cold war, rape, vietnam, power of the press, absolute power corrupting... Yeah, nothing polítical about it.
The new series, which is 2 (!!!!!) episodes out, has so far been about racial conflict. Too polítical where?!? No, just about right what it needs to be. And pretty obvious the motivations of these people "reviewing" the show. I am a white, European who loves comics and who so far, thinks the show is wonderful, from the brilliant cast, up to date subjects, wonderful soundtrack (trent reznor of nine inch nails) and expensive production values. You can't ask for more than this. This is a fantastic show that is a faithful companion piece to the original comics. Most of the snowflakes brigading with downvotes have likely never read the comic and almost certainly haven't bothered to watch this show. Lindelof and company have done an outstanding job bringing this series to life. The writers may be trying to hard to create something " amazing " here. This should have been very good. It wasn't. It's a jumbled mess of a story. Looks like a new watchmen, but as previous ones it draws from our own world as well as the problems we have today, I just want to thank the USA for 1 being the best at portraying our civilization, and 2, for being, as usual, the worst example of civilized human behavior....:(Tulsa 1921) To start off, I don't know why saying white supremacist are bad is political at all, should not at all be considered a left vs right topic. I guess at these times I'm glad to be considered left because yes, people killing anyone based on race should undoubtly be considered evil.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing, everything is sleek and amazing to look at. The editing is also top notch and the amount of creativity put into this as a plausible future to our current society is very interesting. These are the main reasons I will keep watching.<br/><br/>What I was afraid of as this being a superhero type series is that no one seems to be fleshed out. I felt like I was watching a slightly predictable big action thriller movie. The bad guys are esstentially bad because they play out as stereotypes and I don't feel much satisfaction in them being killed because I don't view them as people, just random minions.
The main characters also don't mean much to me. We view them as good because they're relatively friendly, have nice smiles, have children, funny at times. They also don't talk like real people, everything they say just feels very scripted. They all just seem extremely one-sided and am really hoping this will change because if not this will get very boring very quickly, no matter the amount of violence.<br/><br/>Lastly, I initially really enjoyed the background music because it gave a great atmosphere but soon got very tired of it. There is music for nearly every single scene and it seems that it is trying to tell the viewer how to feel instead of letting the viewer think/feel on their own. Maybe this is just part of the style but it just gets annoying at a point.<br/><br/>After watching the 5th episode I can say I'm thrououghly entertained and have been given a good lesson not to judge so critically after 1 episode. I really enjoy most of the fleshed out characters and am now really looking forward to more. Also, I LOVE the editing, cinematography and music. With the initial thinking that it would be too much I have been proven wrong. This is so much fun to watch and even If i didn't like the storyline I think I would continue to watch just for those aspects. If it continues this way I'll bump up my score more.<br/><br/>Also to be clear, I was not one of those who got triggered by some white people being depicted as racist. If you were, this shouldn't be a problem whatsoever after the 1st episode. Not to say those characters no longer exist but their weight of importance definitley subsides. Okay, so first of all, this is not a defence of the movie, which I have always reviled - yes, it visually looked good but missed the mark in every way in execution, and massacred Alan Moore's original story.<br/><br/>This new TV show also takes a huge steaming dump on Moore's greatest work, but in a different way. The movie just failed abysmally at trying to tell the story, whereas the TV show simply smugly discards it and tells a completely different one instead.<br/><br/>It's an interesting experiment to open it up in the middle of a race war in the 1920s, and establish a timeline with a different racial history than our own, but that would have to have led to a markedly different world (and story) than the one Alan Moore wrote.<br/><br/>So why would you do that? Why not just come up with a new story of your own and call it something else?<br/><br/>As with The Last Jedi and the Captain Marvel-era MCU and the Ghostbusters travesty, the answer is this is all about forcing in an unpleasantly divisive ideological agenda into an already existing work, sneaking hugely partisan political propaganda in on the back of goodwill for a beloved masterpiece.<br/><br/>Everything in this show is about race. Or gender. Either way, all white men are evil. That, or accepting they're on the way out. All other matters in the show - story, plot, dialogue, imagination, acting - are secondary to this.<br/><br/>What a time we live in. You would have to go back to 'Birth Of A Nation' or the Nazi period of German filmmaking to find more unapologetic race-hating propaganda in cinema than we see every week coming from HBO and Amazon and all mainstream motion pictures. Whatever future there is worth living in is going to have a very hard time explaining the past 15 years or so.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not a badly-made show, it's nicely shot and competently acted, and there's clearly a good deal of thought and world-building that has gone into it. But then I'm sure "Jew Süss" had some good points too.<br/><br/>The problem is a) the relentless anti-white SJW political agenda being pushed (popular only with the extreme left of the Democrat party), and the ugly racial stereotypes and gleeful celebrations of violence against white people, which can only have the effect of increasing racial tensions, as well as providing justifications and increased support for white separatists, upping the chances of actual armed racial conflict you'd think the makers of the show would be against.<br/><br/>Well, that and b) calling your show 'Watchmen' when it has nothing to do with Watchmen. Off to a good start. It is very watchable and kept me off my phone the entire episode! It is a good start for this series I hope to continue to expand further and give us more information in the second chapter as in this they left us many questions and few answers A true sequel to the comic. Written, directed, and played out stylistically and plot driven like the comic book too. Waaaay better than the Snyder jerkfest from 2009. As a big fan of the Watchmen comics and the movie(extended cut, ofcourse), I was very happy with how this turned out to be. It tells its own story, but it still maintains the feel and the characterics of the og comic book. I won't major on the racial themes of the show, as I understand the desire to make something that feels as socially relevant to today's world as the threat of nuclear war with Russia would have felt in the 80s, but I do feel that some serious shoehorning was carried out on the source material to make it fit this new narrative. Some of this seemed unnecessary to me, though I didn't find it particularly offensive, as this seems like a new vision of the Watchmen world, which I'm ok with.
Overall I found the show compelling enough to want to find out what happened next, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it per se. I suppose I admired the craft, as it looks beautiful and is well acted, but there was something missing: maybe I just didn't care too much about the characters (apart from Looking Glass, who is a great original character). My main gripes are:
1. The mischaracterisation of the few characters used from the source material. In the book Laurie was nothing like the wise-cracking FBI agent she is here, Veidt wasn't a lunatic egomaniac and Dr Manhattan had forgotten about love as a concept he couldn't engage with anymore.
2. Sooo many characters and plot points just abandoned at various points.
3. Jeremy Irons' accent. It's all over the place.
4. Dreadful sound mixing. I had to turn my TV way up to hear the mumbled dialogue, then nearly got deafened by sound effects and music. I'd say I'm bewildered by the low reviews here, but after reading them I can see why. I usually dont bother to write reviews, but this show is being tragically low rated by a bunch of really stupid people. You know, the kind that always complain about identity politics, while voicing their identity politics.<br/><br/>The idea that some of you are upset about the show being nothing but "woke culture references" is a sign of one of two things. Either you are just completely dense and cant see the fact that this is very much NOT woke culture at all, or you are so completely put off by the fact that the "bad guys" are a bunch of Rorschach mask wearing white people, that you can't put your own identity politics aside long enough to watch a tv show and see where the narrative is leading you. Its not to a woke place.<br/><br/>The best part is that I can almost guarantee that these " bad guys" are nothing more than a misdirect, for who the real Big Bad is.<br/><br/>Even if you liked Rorschach in the movies or graphic novel, you really should not be surprised by who has picked up on his journal. The idea that there are forces at play in the world that are far beyond your control, and a journal telling the truth of the world ends up nothing more than a large conspiracy theory seems pretty well suited for a story that is supposed to take place in modern times.
The Rorschach's Journal conspiracy after a giant interdimensional space squid fell on New York doesn't seem to far off the mark from all of the Q conspiracy nonsense.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the idea in the original film or graphic novel that we are all flawed in some way, even the best of us, even a god, then you will like this show.
If you are worried that the show is not connected to the original material in some way, I can only tell you to keep watching. It very much is.
The show is written like it plans to have several seasons, so its taking its time with pacing and character development. There are plenty of instances of "well that wasn't very well explained" or WTF moments in the story, that will be explained if you keep watching. Any future use of Watchmen as a series has probably gone now. Sad really. Way to many ppl rate this a 1 bc it's not a 1:1 version of the movie, and calling it woke..
I guess they prefer binging the netflix show daybreak.<br/><br/>Watchmen gives us a nice counterfactual version of how our world could be today if the events in the movie played out some thirty years ago.<br/><br/>Reviews here are:
"I don't understand it"
"it's confusing"
"it's woke"<br/><br/>Get out of here...<br/><br/>This show has great potential. A modern take on the Watchmen universe balancing complex themes with intense action; produced and directed cinematicly. While Alan Moore is not directly involved, his sense for realism meets conspiracy is present.<br/><br/>A great addition to the HBO lineup post Thrones, and a must watch for fans of the comic. People are rating this series without watching all the episodes just give it a chance, it gets better with every episode, everyone is saying that this is nothing like the book or it does not resemble the world of watchmen, because the story takes place many years after the original events that took place in the graphic novel, In my opinion, it captures the political and tense murder mystery feeling of watchmen very well and mixes it with some new ideas, the production quality is high as expected, I wonder how they will tie all of the unconnected storylines, only time will tell If this series will be a hit or a miss, I've liked it so far and definetly advise it for open minded people :) I adored the graphic novel. I adored the film. I was excited to hear of an HBO adaptation. I was puzzled and concerned when I saw it was set in Tulsa and starred Don Johnson. But from the first scene, through to the end of the third episode now, it has produced similar feelings as the first read. A constant tension. A discomfort. A demand for patience. The quixotic alternate timeline. I realize now it would have betrayed the spirit of the original to just rehash or revisit the same old characters. This show is really telling a story, and is genuinely something special. I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I should balance the scale when I saw that people were reviewing this title as bad purely because they don't like seeing shows about racial tensions. Your personal preference for stories about white people having adventures and not thinking too much about race has nothing to do with the excellence of this show. Also, to the people who keep saying this show is written by woke white people, "Of the 12 writers, four are white men; the rest, women and/or people of color" (LA Times).<br/><br/>This show is 1000x better than the Watchmen movie. It has deeper character development, truly haunting and disturbing sequences, beautifully crafted dialogue and it's not afraid to confront people with the hard questions and make them evaluate their own hatred. It is also bringing the tragic events of Tulsa to the forefront of history, an event that has been suppressed for almost a hundred years. You should really watch this... At least the pilot.<br/><br/>The costuming is phenomenal. Its adaptations of the comic make it pertinent to our present age. And you know, it really isn't my favorite superhero adaptation ever, but it's definitely worth giving a chance. Pirate Jenny FTW I was hoping to binge watch this show, but it was just awful. The writing must have been someone who didn't graduate middle school. The acting was over the top and really more for children. And the worst of all, it was really boring. I watched the pilot, and while i was pleasantly surprised,
i didn't expect too much.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of role reversal, cops wearing masks, emulating the same heroes that are now branded vigilante criminals.<br/><br/>Very first 2-3 episodes felt like a piece was missing,
And then they started to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>It's clever, i like it. Beside the racial angle and stuff, that serie have alot of quality. Im at the 6th episode, and I think its a piece of art honestly.
Its not for eveyrone, maybe, but its a very special show. I've never read the original graphic novel, and I never liked the movie. The whole concept always seemed antiquated and unrelatable to me. So when this show began, I didn't think it would be anything more than just a boring remake of a story, that was already completely outdated. And the first episode didn't do much to change my mind, although I was thrilled to see Don Johnson in a key role. After the first 2 episodes, I think my rating would have been maybe 6 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>But now, after 5 episodes, the show has really taken off. The concept and the universe is getting more and more fascinating and surreal, the story is gradually unfolding in a wonderfully bizarre way, and the characters are getting deeper.<br/><br/>I'm hooked now, and I hope this show will soon be widely recognized for what it is: Not a squeal, not a remake, not a prequel, not a reboot. But an entirely new, stand-alone story inspired by the original concept. My rating now is 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>(Sorry for my poor English, it's not my native language) I don't write reviews often but here we go...<br/><br/>First, let's address the elephant in the room. This is a left-leaning show.<br/><br/>The story doesn't take place in some sort of "liberal utopia" -- in fact, the show points out this society's weaknesses (showing that neither side is without flaws).<br/><br/>Watchmen paints conservative people in a pretty negative light. If that will offend you, I'd recommend skipping the show completely... Instead of watching it, being offended, and coming here to give the show a one star review.<br/><br/>People who claim this isn't a faithful adaptation of the comics are incorrect. Watchmen always consisted of politically-charged, polarizing subject matter. The original didn't deal as much with race but that's why this is considered a continuation (not an adaptation). This show is so much a continuation that i'd recommend doing a little research because some of the stuff will be confusing if you've only seen the movie.<br/><br/>Watch the show and stop giving negative reviews because you wanted something different... I don't give Sesame street bad reviews for not catering to adults enough. Don't know what the negative comments are about but I am so loving this show..!!! So adult! And the actors are stellar! Loved the movie and now the show. A new masterpiece from Damon Lindelof. I have been waiting for this show since I watched The Leftovers. That is simply smart and beautiful. Thank you Lindelof. This is not only a very expertly crafted series so far but hugely entertaining and suspenseful. Acting is very good, direction and cinematography great, music excellent. I am not familiar with the comic and even if I were I try not to compare different art forms. Being a lit and cinema double degree I give them license to create. Also I am not a Russian troll or contemporary American racist who would give this a super low rating to push an agenda. Give this show a watch man! You won't be disappointed. The show started off great, complex and ambiguous characters, mysteries and respect to the comic book source, but doing its own thing. The show brings a lot of grey characters and is political driven in an alternate reality, but keeps a foot in our world, just like the watchmen comics were in the 80s, but with a current days story. It starts with a sad part of american history then jumps to the alternate reality, linking them both. I can´t wait for the points to be linked in the next episodes, great structure so far. I am not familiar with the comics but the show and storyline is great so far. I never can tell when it comes to certain comic book culture fans, whether there tastes comes from a real viewers aesthetic, vs an unrealistic comic book readership, which to me, is arbitrary when viewing an adaptation.
In the case of Zack Snyder's film adaptation, (which let's face it, wasn't fully appreciated, and maybe for good reason at the time) We got a "COMIC BOOK READERS" nearly dead on version of the comic. Which box office wide was unimpressive, and got mixed reviews.
With this series premiere, Lindelof brings us BACK to the universe of ALAN MOORE'S "Watchmen", but accomplished something Snyder's couldn't. An ACTUAL REAL CONNECTION to our history in AMERICA. The episode opens with one of the most shockingly controversial opens for a "comic book" you may ever see. He recreates the TULSA MASSACRE of 1921, also known as the destruction of "BLACK WALL STREET ", in which 100 of black men & women many home & business owners were lynched, burned as well the entire community burned to the ground. Most don't realized this was an ACTUAL event in history. Others, simply fail to see how this opening serves as Lindelof's OWN THEMATIC TOUCH, (as opposed to word for word copy)to SYNC & parallel OUR human history, as does Alan Moore's original source material, USING Richard Nixon's Presidency as a device. We open with an actual historic event of America's ugly underside, witnessed through the eyes of child.
Next scene, we are artfully thrown through the timeline of the same Oklahoma town, in the WATCHMEN parallel universe, with one minor change in history being the clever link to our reality. America's current climate of racial tension isn't a secret, I think.
Regina King shines as the "vigilante" cop/heroine in a world where cops must hide there identity. Much like criminals..or Super HEROES? Which, depending on what you want to interpret, Is a great concept for this universe. The first "bad guy" we meet is a member of a supposedly white supremacist organization, known Only as the "7th Calvary" being pulled over by a black, masked highway cop. This introductory encounter shows us the world of policing has changed as the officer, who suspects the driver is a member, can't even draw his weapon, without permissive clearance, subsequently leading to the cops murder. Enter Don Johnson, (Who's likability as a good ol boy, is becoming more & more impressive) As the seasoned & war weathered sheriff in a town that apparently has had a tumultuous series of events, since its NIXON 80's alternate history. It should be noted, That we as viewers get a better, more inclusive look at the WATCHMEN universe, but from a RURAL, "Heartland America" setting as opposed to the novels more Industrial,City backdrop. For those who didn't like this premiere, I can only surmise are those aforementioned, sensitive "dude bros", whose precious literary world's cannot be bothered with anything touching what their minds idea of the "comic" should be. What Lindelof has done is add his own ACTUALLY CREATIVE touch, using all of the source materials TRUE elements. With multiple Certain events nodding even to Snyder's work. I smiled when it starting raining squids midway through the episode. Original storylines BASED on the source material must involve a creator, but also a viewer having imagination. By the end of the episode He seems to be building his own "noir" like mystery, w our badassed main protagonist, (King)reeling from shock & loss, w a gun aimed at the man who happened to be the same child we followed in our traumatic opening scene. All in all, this was an impressive & purposefully secretive (plot wise) start. I like that we Didn't getvan explanation for EVERYTHING that going on right away, rather more focus on connecting on how our characters are living an have assimilated to this world. I'm definitely gonna watch The next one. Anyone who thinks this is not Watchmen or thinks it is too political has not read the original in context.<br/><br/>The writers have taken the altered timeline and run with it, and it is very intriguing.<br/><br/>I look forward to more. I like the dynamic of police having serious oversight, and their anonymity. I also enjoyed the detectives that function in a vigilante way, looking forward to how the series develops The same people whining about racism being portrayed, showing a white supremacist as one of the many varied set-pieces in this story, are usually the same people who complain that other people are easily offended. Pick a lane, guy. If it bothers you so much that there is a white militia, their whiteness and race relations aren't really the center of the story. The show gets weird and opens up a lot of exciting possibilities. There really is a lot to like for watchmen fans, if you give it a chance without feeling attacked because somehow you think that a writer portraying racism is attacking you and your values. Unless you're part of a white supremacist militia, no one here is attacking you.<br/><br/>For me, I prefer this over the Mandalorian, the other current big show. The writing here is more complex, they take risks to portray a fresh story, and it has excellent actors and characters as in Lindelof's last show, the Leftovers. Its 2019, and you put a black female lead character (not that good) in order to 'wake as'. The destruction of cinema. Get over it. Nobody gives a damn about a race. Great show, good casting and interesting storyline. Sure, this is not exactly the Watchmen people thought they would see in the first episode... but it will be getting there, can't show all the good stuff at the very beginning.. where is the fun in that? Every show needs a setup and buildup, and this was a damn good one as a beginning. The proper reviewers who got to see the first 6 episodes absolutely loves it, rating it a highly 85 on Metacritic for a reason, and I am sure we as a regular viewer will too. For my sake, the editing was amazing, as well as the music and acting. The plot in this first episode was a little bit hard to grasp, as we don't get proper explanations on the raining squids and why the world is as bad as it is.. just that it is so due to "racism" etc. However, we will get them soon enough.. just like the last movie, this series might need a few rewatches as well to really get it all.. and please, people.. pay attention to details. This isn't watchmen. HBO has taken the rights to the franchise and completely ruined it with all this racist/feminism . Anyone who even remotely thinks this is a decent show needs a reality check and a swift kick. The lead actress is no where near convincing and the fights scenes are pathetic. I can't even take Chromedome seriously because of holes. I can't look at him without thinking about that damn shovel scene. A densely layered, fast-paced, slick, stylized, suspense-filled, thiller with powerful performances from the entire cast. An alternate timeline for the past 100 years of U.S. History, TV shows within TV shows, and the political commentary on society absent but for the original Watchmen graphic novel and movie.
The Trent Reznor score completes the overall vibe and adds the tension and excitement to series.
Damon Lindelof brings his A game
from "Lost" and provides several "mystery boxes" to give the show legs, with the density modern audiences expect. Every poster, billboard, and video screen is used to advance the world building.
All of which add to the rewatch-ability of the show. As close to perfect of an opener as you can get, and the final score just depends on the follow through. This show insists upon itself.
It fails to keep me interested, has no likable charachters. I have never read the graphic novel (being no fan of comic books whatsoever) but I have been a big fan of 2009 film adaptation that's why I was so eager to see this new tv series. And as soon as I found out who was behind the production and screenplay I became even more eager to see it - so far Damon Lindelof has not disappointed me, with The leftovers (2014-2017) and especially Lost (2004-2010) being among my favorites of all time, so what can I say about this brand new tv show of his? It is great. In every way. Starting with its brilliant screenplay that doesn't allow you to relax for a second, always on the run for unanswered questions, mysterious cases and things to think and rethink about and ending with superb camera work, outstanding acting and stunning visuals. This Watchmen expand and extend the aforeknown universe that I grew up liking very much and it was an absolute joy to be on this journey again. Hoping for a second season to arrive soon... GOT ending was terrible, but in all sincerity it'd be wrong to condemn the whole brilliant show just by a few bad story-telling episodes. Why am I references GOT? I was looking for another show at the same level or close, and I think Watchmen can live up to it given time and consistency. The suspense is crazy! I do understand the negative reviews and rating, it's a reflection of the parties in the show. I think majority represents the bad guys in the show ðŸ˜‚. And just like episode 4 said, "If You Don't Like My Story, Write Your Own". If you don't get the point as some has said, means it's a good one cos it's challenging your mind, making you think and look forward to what's next. I recommend rewatching and you'll eventually get it.<br/><br/>Not forgetting, thumps up to great casting! It's simply incredible. I've thought I couldn't be this impressed by anything. I waited years for Death Stranding and I was disappointed. I waited a decade for The Irishman and it was a let down. Yet Watchmen improves with every episode. I thought episode 5 would be the highlight of the season. Then somehow episode 6 was even better. Now episode 7 had brought me to tears. I can't even imagine what episodes 8 and 9 will bring. Working with predicaments layed out in The Watchmen cartoon, this series delivers an independent, provocing, and yet exiting commentary of our present and US 20th century history. As of now, the series gets better for each episode both thanks to great acting and a very good script. As in Watchmen, the series (quite convincingly) shows how our present could have unfolded with slight alterments of our historical preconditions. This helps saying things about our present and history that otherwise might have been hard to narrate. The fictional universe that the series constructs works as telling mirror of our very real past and present. It's one of the greatest superheros tv show i ever seen. I know It isnt perfect, but im really enjoying it. I initially rated Watchmen series 3-stars since I found it not very watchable. I had assumed that the series would be similar to the movie, which I very much enjoyed for its unique take on those with powers and the society of which they lived. To my disappointment the early episodes focused on racial discrimination, which just didn't seem to fit this world? Yet thankfully the show developed layers, or however best to describe a series that transforms into something special. At this point I don't know what to expect from this series, and that's what what's needed. Keep surprising me, go beyond the typical, and the next I visit this page I'll likely move my 8-stars to 10-stars. 5 episodes in and i really enjoy its dark surealism. It should never have been an attempt to copy the original comic and i am glad they didnt. Cant wait to see where that leads us! Ugh, that's about all I can say about this show. I got my fill within the first 20 minutes of the first episode of this fetishized social justice fantasy centered heavily on current American liberal narratives. First of all shame on all who say remembering of Tulsa is "left propaganda". You're such fools to fall for this nonsense. While you're becoming more blind by your hate, those who manipulate you get richer and richer. They don't care about you at all.<br/><br/>Now the important thing: The content. High quality in all aspects. This alternate history seems interesting and I'm looking forward to the next episodes. And remember: The original remains what it is, no matter how you like this show: Probably the best graphic novel of all time. This is just a fan creating his version of a sequel. And so far it seems to be a story worth watching. However maybe it should not have been called Watchmen.<br/><br/>Depending on how the season evolves I might change my rating. This is just the first impression.<br/><br/>Update: THIS IS WATCHMEN. Forget what I said about the naming. Terrible adaptation of the Watchmen graphic novel.<br/><br/>Badly acted, badly shot, awful choreography for the action sequences, even worse choice of music ( although the original score isn't bad ), terribly scripted.<br/><br/>Although the premise is good and it has generated some controversy, that seems to be all the director is interested in doing, telling a compelling story or developing interesting characters are bottom of the list of priorities here.<br/><br/>Boring tripe, don't bother with it, there is absolutely nothing to do with Watchmen here bar some badly executed hat tips. Seems that the biggest issue people have with this show is that it is about race. Well that tells us all one thing about these people doesn't it. I bet many of them don't really even know it about themselves but they are. Probably have a problem with women also.<br/><br/>The show, by the way, is great. Having read a lot of the comments on here they seem to come from DC comics fans who wanted a show exactly like the story in the comics themselves.
Other people seem offended by the fact that there's a 50/50 black cast with a black female lead and that the show is referencing current US racial politics (someone mentioned Roots the reboot).
Really? I mean really? That's incredibly sad and pathetic and why we need a show like this in the first place, for people with that level of bigotry to actually feel ashamed and get over themselves.
Anyway, I think all that is very short sighted and irrelevant to actual enjoyment of the show
For me it is thought provoking, incredibly exciting, interestingly nuanced, great acting, what quality entertainment should be,
I know that US audiences don't typically like subtlety but you should really stick with this and allow it to evolve.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
It could be amazing, if the director, writers and show runner are left alone to fulfil their vision.
If it bows to fan pressure and becomes just another Titans, basically 2 dimensional with no interesting story arc for any of the characters and every episode the same, then it will be a real shame. It's all very well starting a slow burner, but when you trade on a name like Watchmen, the audience are expecting some connection rather than this. References to the original characters are added in the same way that con-men would shoot buckshot loaded with gold dust into rocks to fool someone into thinking there's a rich seam of gold to be mined.<br/><br/>Characters you don't care about, strange music and hard for non-US audiences to relate to. A big let-down after all the hype. Just rubbish riddled with woke agenda. Its soo depressing to see HBO, a radical in TV programming to this. It is hard to stress just how deeply uninteresting this series is. As a fan of anything superhero, if not necessarily the source material, I felt compelled to stick with it but this really is one of those shows where there is scarcely any redeeming virtue to be found.<br/><br/>None of the characters are interesting or likable, none of the sets are particularly interesting. Dialogue is garbage and pacing non existent.<br/><br/>It got an extra star because none of the acting has made me wince. Otherwise, what a regrettable and terrible waste of time. I thought I'd give up this series after watching three eoisids.However, after the third episode, I couldn't wait for each of the following. I think every comic book fan has to look at this. Incredibly. The show so far is an incredible masterpiece for watchmen fans
People who says crap about it probably didn't even watch the movie Yes, I won't mention their name or channel but a critic I respect the opinion of a great deal ripped this a new one. Admittedly that was just based on the first episode but they then said they would not be watching any other episodes. This I have a huge problem with. TV shows need to be given a chance and although the change of location and jump forward in time to the present day were jarring, for me they were not at all impossible to overcome. I was intrigued and kept coming back for more and now after watching the 4th episode I am hooked. Point out for me a bad performance? You won't find one and it strikes the perfect gritty and slightly surreal tone. This folks is the sequel to the comics/graphic novel we deserve and I personally couldn't care less if Alan Moore and my favourite critic aren't going to give it a chance. Their loss. This show is a very solid continuation of the Watchmen story, taking place in the not so distant future. It, like the others, explores themes like abuse of power, and what face justice represents. I say i have to laugh at the negative reviews for a couple of reasons. 1.) despite common claims, this show doesn't race bait. 2.) The show is not nearly, even remotely close to be the political fest the negative reviewers are making it out to be. The irony of this criticism, however, is that Watchmen has ALWAYS been a political story. So complaining about it being even remotely political in nature is just getting mad that it's being accurate to the spirit of Allan Moore's story (Allan moore, a guy who often invokes political and social themes into his stories).<br/><br/>Look I'm far left, and I even asked Trump supporting conservative friends of mine if they felt the show race baited or was overly political, and literally none of them have thought so. In fact, they've all love it. In fact, we nerd out the following Monday at work and theorize about the prior episode, and what we think will happen next. The point is that the people complaining about this are either some overly triggered folks, or else they're trolling; in both cases, I guarantee you the haven't watched more than the first episode. There's a lot of review bombing for this show and it's sad that a lot of it is because it involves race. Not sure why a show about race makes people so angry?<br/><br/>The pilot definitely will make you wonder "how in the world is this show related to Watchmen??" and of course if you're a hardcore fanboy you'll probably be pissed. But obviously it's the pilot and definitely a show of its own. Any good show wouldn't just reveal all the details and in this case, the full on transition between the novel to the show all in the first episode. After watching the second episode you can start to see it scratches the surface a little more.<br/><br/>Being a Watchmen fan from the beginning I think overall it's a great show. Awesome visuals, fight scenes, a unique and fresh storyline and definitely a lot of mystery that, assuming you're not annoyed by race and not an annoying fanboy expecting this to be an easy sequel, will leave you interested to find out more and how it ties to the novel. I'm gonna give my opinion without being a left or right freak. Since when is fighting racism "woke"?<br/><br/>The show is great. Great directing. Great pacing. Great acting. I can't say much about how it relates to watchmen comics, but it's a reimagining. It's not supposed to be a continuation.<br/><br/>Definitely worth checking out. Full disclosure - I'm not familiar with the comic, and I was not a fan of the movie. BUT I'm thoroughly enjoying this show so far. It's a bit out there and you definitely need to go into it with an open mind, but IMO that's what makes it entertaining. It might not be for the hardcore comic/movie fans (I wouldn't know) but as for the conservative snowflakes throwing a fit about an "agenda" y'all should maybe just relax & stick to Fox News and reruns of Last Man Standing. Something we here in America have done for generation's now is edit our history and do everything we can to shelter ourselves and sweep our sins under the rug and pretend an entire segment of our society hasn't been under constant attack since before the forming of our nation. Now, because you're triggered by seeing an entirely possible distopian racially charged society this show sucks? First off it doesn't, it's really well made thus far. Also if you read the original comic the entire thing is political. Instead of the threat of nuclear war this show has the threat of a race war. Also this show goes both ways as did the comic, too much conservatism is just as bad as too much liberalism. This begs the question about the real snowflakes, the liberal far left sjws who whine about everything or the far right clowns who pretend racism doesn't exist anymore while wrapping themselves their prejudiced blankets. Finally it's just a show, if it bothers you don't watch it, that simple. If you want a calm and rational review with no tantrums then read on, if you want to cry about Watchmen like other people have i'd move along.<br/><br/>So many people are upset about Watchmen's initial episodes, they are confused and don't like to see white people looking bad i.e the cavalry. Now I could mention the long list of shows that convey black people as criminals and asian's as terrorists. I could but i won't because that would take forever. I just suggest if you are white you get over yourself and maybe drop the double standards if you want people to take your complaints seriously.<br/><br/>I am not surprised they are teasing with the plot it is afterall Watchmen. Bewildered by the number of people who seem to want an easily spoon fed story. Good things come to those who wait. The cinematography and cast selection is brilliant, i can't wait to see more of Jeremy Ion's and his perculiar servants. Some of the dialogue was heavy handed, somewhat sloppy but with American shows this often happens. It is going to be one of those shows that leaves you asking questions and i expect a big pay off later on else it will be a severe disappointment. I went into this show as someone who enjoyed the comics and the broader work of Alan Moore very much. I am glad it's not a direct adaptation. That was the main reason I never watched Zack Snyder's adapta6. I watched the first episode and then was very confused at the backlash for it being political, with many alleging that they were fans of the comic as well. I'm not sure if those folks really understood the subversive themes of the original material. This show takes those themes far forward into our times. More curiously, while the show explores race and state power with nothing held back, the dichotomy between good and evil is not clear cut. There are plenty of aspects of the protagonists which could be seen as "problematic" in terms of civil liberties and respect for the rule of law. Really I just find the world building of this show to be extremely intriguing. The little hints of alternate history in the background really drew me in, as a fan of Man in the High Castle. It is also chock full of homage to the comic, while respecting it enough to build forward from its precedent rather than simply rehashing its plot (a main reason I gave up on the Game of Thrones series, particularly when it passed by the books). It is a puzzle to be untangled, kind of like the new Westworld. Give this show a chance. Don't let politicians' narrow concept of race and power stain your judgment of the themes in this work.<br/><br/>Update: having watched ep 5 and reread comic books, I can confirm this is definitely Watchmen, with familiar faces, conspiracies and paranoia from all sides. No one is who they seem. Loving this show! It is quite apparent to me that most people who have taken the time to write a review criticising this show and it's first episode for the lack of the watchmen quite clearly did not look into what the show is about and the time period this is set in.<br/><br/>The television show takes place after the events of the watchmen film in which most of the watchmen are either dead or they have gone into retirement with minor hints and references towards them throughout the first episode from the nite owl ship, the video clip of dr Manhattan on mars and so on.<br/><br/>Thank you I don't write reviews often but I must say this show is amazing. The only thing I think it's lacking are the fighting scenes. But everything else is perfect. People will always get upset when race is involved yet it's still a real problem to this day. Why not explore in watchmen. If anyone ever read the damn comic they would know this is the way watchmen handled their material. Even the movie was this way. The comic and film always made the reader uncomfortable. Why should HBO's version of it be any different. I'll end my review with the title of Episode 4.<br/><br/>"If you don't like my story, write your own" I hate racists, and I hate racism. And I would gladly watch a show being a bit satirical and edgy about it.<br/><br/>But this is just bad. It's badly written and the worst crime of all. It's boring. I watched the two first episodes and so far, nothing has happened. People that have rated this stupidly low clearly do not understand the concept of Watchmen. It's not supposed to be about the movie. Are you even aware it was a comic series in the 80s? The series is based at another period in time, in another part of America within an alternative universe.
The original writer, Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and satirize the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history. It looks by the reviews that this is touching too close to some people's person social anxieties. If there's too many black faces for you in this show, that's a point it's shining a light on.
The show has a great cast, it's dark, well directed, the choreography is believable and a fresh take in a tv series. It's actually better than I thought. The latest good thing that falls under the claws of the political correctness.
The production is at a very high level and it is not something surprising when you have such people involved - starting from actors and to the music.
But from the pilot that I watched (which was enough for me) there is literally nothing that could make me get to the next episode.
Plot is absolute zero. We have some bad guys in masks who are planning their evil moves among cows and then police officers with masks in wealthy holmes...dafuq. The contrast between the classes and the privilege to show your face is quite clear, but still this first episode didn't introduce anything else but hatred between people and not a single clue why the bad guys are actually bad...
This pilot is reeeeeaaaally far from good and if someone thinks differently, I advise to watch the one from Breaking Bad to compare.
Thank you for ruining something good and deliviring nothing new - again. I first wrote a review after watching half of the episode. After watching it all I bumped my rating up to a full 10. I see a lot of snowflakes that are upset because they don't like to be reminded of history. They are upset because the show mirrors a dark truth about our society that has came back in a full circle. However, if you have an open mind and you understand the Watchmen comics then you can see how this script and story falls within the realm of the great story. I get a sense that the snowflakes will keep watching and become amazed at how historically correct this show will end up; because many of us believe that the rich and powerful are behind everything horrible in our society. They keep us hating each other in order to maintain control and you can see that from the anger that the snowflakes have left in their reviews. Just might become the best show ever. I think if people get off of the belief that everything is a political agenda targeted at their (often) pathetic causes they could enjoy the show...good story and good acting....I think HBO is off to a good start with this one... Took an ok comic and turned it into a racial statement that feeds hatred and paranoia. Let's start with a very obvious point. Even if you don't like this show there's literally no way, if you are being honest with yourself, give it 1 or 2 stars. It's too well filmed, directed and acted to be a 1 star production. Purely from a position of objectivity it's at least a 6/10 just for its production values.<br/><br/>So basically ignore the obvious agenda driven trolls.<br/><br/>What I'm really saying is that this show is FAR better than its 6.8 rating. Ignore that and just give it a go. It's excellent so far Don't believe the review bombing. Just don't. HBO has the greatest shows of the decade, and with Watchmen's pilot, it seems like it is one of those. Update: As of the 3rd episode. It has improved quite a bit. Both the 2nd and 3rd episode were much much better than the 1st. Was enjoying each new episode until the current one(6). Hollywood once again needlessly pushing some weird twisted agenda. Watch it and you will know exactly what I mean. Right at about 35 and a half minutes in. Drivel story twist about a married man. Same as they did in Doom Squad. Give it a rest already lol.<br/><br/>This one has great filming, but terrible writing. Also the attempt to be politically correct in everything just makes it boring. Regina King as the "Hero" cop and a main character falls flat. HBO seems unable to make great shows anymore. Some of the scenes were ridiculous.<br/><br/>-The techniques used by the police when approaching hostiles.
-Police using animal carcasses for cover against 50 cal machine guns. The bullets would go straight through. The same as you see on here with the majority of other terrible movies and shows.
Summary: Poorly Written Rubbish Bored to death. Answers start to reveal after episode five and by then I was so borEd that I didn't care about them. I just wanted to finish the damn series. I didn't like it a bit. This is a beautifully made work of art. Whatever it was based on does not matter- it stands on its own as an experience. Just watch it and be sure to listen to the equally good soundtrack that accompanies it. Suddenly you see a flow of reviews giving it 9-10/10, and by accounts with very few or only Watchmen reviewed. That made me decide to make my first review.<br/><br/>The people defending this show as being that good is kind of making a big point that the Watchmen show, movie, comic makes. It is about pop culture and politics, and everyone defending all fell for it, just as the ones hating it.<br/><br/>The show is ok. Sometimes even great. But in the end it is only Hollywood virtue signalling as it best, and it's worst. To defend it as "the comic is also political" is not an argument, it is projecting your own ideological views on the medium.<br/><br/>In a era with Greta Thunberg being on the cover of Time.<br/><br/>We already have the Dr Manhattan, we only change what product or person we worship as the god figure. The only thing I know is I've enjoyed every second and I need to find out what happens next - what more could you want? WOW! WATCH WATCHMEN. Well done HBO. Well done. 👏👏👏<br/><br/>This is slander from internet trolls swaying viewers not to watch this show because they "believed" it was too "political"?! How is the subject about racism is now being considered to be political -again? Really? One would think after World War 2, we would stop seeing racism as a "political" topic? When in actuality this is a HUMAN RIGHTS topic.<br/><br/>I can not tell you how timely and smart this show is during the scariest times our nation is facing - again. Sad to say, but history does repeat itself. This show is so smart. I appauld to the writing team for tackling this with such bravery. Thank you for making this show entertaining and great! Here's to creating stories to help influence people for a better world. Came to IMDB to verify that I really was seeing Don Johnson in a lead role in this...Stayed for all the butthurt in the comments from the white supremacist 4Chan set that seems to have invaded. *SPOILER ALERT*: He gets impeached AND indicted, m'dudes. I'd give this big beautiful production 50 stars if I could. Watchmen HBO 🔥
My new fav show.
Racism, white supremacy, cinematography, story telling, intense drama, & pure class. I loved it from start to finish. How it fits together perfectly like a puzzle. All the clever call-backs to the original comic. The recontextualization of its themes with America's history of racism. And the excellent cast and the amazing score, just all of it... I was blown away with how good this show was. The first eight episodes range from very good to great, but the finale is an absolute mess. Ice shot down like a gatling gun, but it only punctures through a hand, cops survive hiding in cars, a phone booth to Mars holds up fine, but the super transfer machine can't handle it... a super cage for Dr Manhattan that let's liquified man leak through, suddenly Veidt will be held responsible, just tons of random ideas poorly jammed into a sloppily executed ending to an amazing series.<br/><br/>No real surprises in this ending, it's all laid out in the 8th episode. I just wish they had told the finale better than they did. Yes this could be Lindelof 'Lost', but it is true to the spirit of the graphic novel, so far. Anyone calling it 'Woke' sarcastically needs to understand that it comes from a period before 'Woke' was a recognised term, it's over 30 years old, from a time when there were people who knew and cared and the other sort. The massacre at the start was a real thing, that I've never seen depicted before. If by 'woke' you mean informed, educated and and capable of empathy then yes it is indeed 'woke'. But I don't see that as a problem. I was intrigued from the start. Love the historic references and parallels to present day. So many stories to unfold. I will continue to watch. Not sure why all the hate. As a fan of the graphic novel and the movie, I found this a welcome and fresh addition to the Watchmen universe. I look forward to watching the story unfold as we get to know these new characters and discover their relationship to the previous Watchmen. And who doesn't like a badass mother of two who bakes by day and is a vigilante by night? This is coming from someone who knows nothing about comic books or any of the other crap people are complaining about. From my perspective, the pilot has done everything to draw in the viewer, especially those with an open mind. Similar to today's society we start to see how relationships should be, but on a micro level vs. how they really are in the real world To me, this the show is a change from the same crap I've been seeing in all of 30+ years.<br/><br/>It seems the conservative mindset has trouble accepting the show and enjoying the newer perspective. Perhaps these people only want to see the same stuff they've seen all their lives. If people can get over this then maybe they can enjoy the show to. It would seem that most of the haters here are stuck in THIS reality and are forgetting that the show takes place in an ALTERNATE universe! Of which there's are infinite possibilities. Marriage to one's expectation folly. It's been ONE episode. Personally, I'm reserving judgment.<br/><br/>It's true, that at points it seems random and disjointed. And, not unlike many great pilots the show asks more questions then it answers. But, I'm firmly convinced that it was completely intentional. And, I'm willing to wait for the story to develop.<br/><br/>But, so far... not bad. First off, the people complaining that's it's too political clearly never saw the original movie or read the graphic novel, or else it all went over their heads. Politics is a central aspect of Watchmen. In this show, it was more subtle. The first episode is a focus on white nationalism. Now some people have complained that this is race baiting, but it's just accurate. Both the threat of white nationalism, and the state infringing on basic rights investigating it. The Intercept literally just published an article revealing this earlier this week. This takes it to an extreme level, sure; but it's Watchmen, it's supposed to be extreme. I would highly recommend it. The pacing is great, it has well written dialog, the cinematography and choreography are both spot on, and the performances are all top both. The score is also really enthralling. I highly recommend giving it a go. Don't buy into the negative hype; it's just a bunch of people getting easily triggered about themes that have been relevant throughout history. If the target audience for this title was 7-11 years old kids, please don't read further!<br/><br/>Obviously there is a trend to politicize popular titles transforming them into platforms for race, gender, sex orientation, left-right orientation, rich vs poor, east vs west propaganda, but did not expect Watchmen to choose the racism aspect. Especially when the original title already had other aspects, such as Soviets vs the World and Aliens vs the World. I don't think that ideological and fantasy aspects are same as the race aspect, therefore I don't think "Watchmen" brought a positive outcome for any of the two.<br/><br/>This is not the only reason I gave it a 3/10 though. The title is full of predictable cliche phrases and piano scenes (meaning very annoying and boring, pointlessly enforced "drama" slow scenes that no one cares about), The main character is a "karate woman" that obviously needs to loose like 50lb before trying to jump like this (no offense to the actress please, it's just we can't all be karate people just because it's cool), but flexible I guess, and I don't even want to comment on her mask - it's just laughable. ..and her hood..lol, give me a break - worst hood design ever.<br/><br/>I am not writing a real review here - that would be very hard with those really annoying elements that I mentioned above. So it's just my honest opinion - the original "Watchmen" movie was a masterpiece. This one is 3/10. This is must see TV! Renewed my HBO subscription just for this show. Doesn't disappoint in any way. Great job! This show was just rubbish, it was boring the characters where not very good the acting was terrible and the story wasnt enjoyable. It feels so far from the comics so I don't understand the other reviews saying others haven't read them when your given this garbage. This seems to be a good show in the making, but apparently people cannot handle the fictional race war world this it is based in. Shows you that this is more of a problem than one would think! Great show, just watch it and ignore the supremacist that think otherwise. In the words of our president they are, "SAD!!" Never watched a movie as it never git me hooked, but this was very interesting to watch, I have many questions unanswered and I hope next episode will be evem better Weird but brilliant strange but amazing.. I loved the movie..knew.nothing of the books I was confused as to what was happening for a episode or 2 but I persevered and it got better and better I really liked it What a joke. The ending of the season is like a bad cop show. The characters are at best silhouettes of the Moore originals, with Veidt an arrogant lunatic, Jon Osterman an asperger's stereotype, and Laurie Juspeczyk as Cagney or Lacey.<br/><br/>I thought it was bad enough when the original mini-series was filtered through Zack Snyder's barren imagination. Now I know you just need this Lindelof schmoe to have-at-it and you get some paint-by-numbers drivel with a heaping helping of cinematography to distract.<br/><br/>No likeable characters, no sane arcs. The charms of individual performances are all that's offered and there's so very few of those which charm. As a fan of the original comic, I was skeptical. But the show exceeded my expectations. Yowza. Great cinematography. Acting was spot on. Plot line was slightly complicated in Episode 1 because it needed to lay out the characters. Regina King is always good. Don Johnson was the surprise ... wonderful performance. I'll be watching this series every week. When I was 10 years old, I read the Watchmen graphic novel and it looks actually violent. I haven't seen the 2009 Zack Snyder movie, but I wasn't allowed to see it because it was R-rated.<br/><br/>Now, I watched the first episode of the HBO series adaptation and it looks fantastic! It is not a sequel to the 2009 film, it is actually a sequel to the graphic novel!<br/><br/>The casting, including Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, and more, were fantastic; the setting that took place in an alternate timeline after the events of the graphic novel is great; and Damon Lindelof, the show runner behind Lost, did a great job creating the show for an adaptation!<br/><br/>If you're a fan of either the original graphic novel or the 2009 Zack Snyder film, then you'll love the HBO series adaptation! I was really looking forward to this. Read the comic books as a kid, and I really thought the film was terrific and underrated. So a series was an exciting idea to me. I like the cast and the special effects are good but after 3 episodes I'm confused and bored. I get that liberal writers want to shoehorn in their liberal belief system but the stupid politics are so distracting and the plot is so dull I just gave up. Damon Lindhoff has Put together another masterpiece for HBO. I know nothing about the Watchmen universe or the graphic novel, So I am viewed the first episode with no preconceived ideas or expectations. So very impressed with the brilliant cast, production values and the amazing score. A must see! I am so glad I decided to watch this despite the politically motivated negative reviews. Do yourself a favor. Watch it. Decide for yourself. Big fan of the graphic novel and fan of the movie, but this HBO series bears zero resemblance to either. Viewers familiar with either of those would not recognize them in this travesty. On its own, even if it was mildly interesting, the painfully slow-drip revelation of what we presume to be foundational background information and plot is sheer torture.<br/><br/>The, ahem., "professional" critics who called this "riveting" with "brilliant writing" have zero credibility. Excellent show. Spiritually in tune with the comic book with added world-building. Not knowing anything about watchmen, this show is hella weird and super racist. i just imagine the races being reversed and it would be causing so much outrage.<br/><br/>
im so sick of racebaiting tv shows, im a leftie,a liberal,i love inclusion but even i am not blind to how in the last decade white people are the only race that its considered oke to paint in a bad light or to be racist against. the only race that is allowed to be replaced and the only race that gets crap on in every woke tv show out there. First I was really confused about the story but it all makes sense...
(Warning: spoilers from the first episode)<br/><br/>Yes, you need to know the backstory of the watchmen comic or movie (just watch a quick recap video on Youtube, like the one from alt shift x).<br/><br/>The first episode comes full circle. It has many hints on what happened after the movie/comic.
We even see a few characters from the original comic (like Ozymandias or Mr. Manhattan)
Unfortunately a lot of viewers are not able to pick up the many hints, analyze or comprehend the first episode.
For example, the old movie that the boy watches in the beginning shows a corrupt sheriff. He gets hanged just like the sheriff at the end of the first episode. Other easter eggs that spotted are for example the owl coffee mug, the tv serie about the minute men or the song that plays during the dinner scene (which is the same one that played during the comedians death in the movie (but I'm not entirely sure about that))<br/><br/>In my opinion most bad ratings are due because most people dont understand the story or complain about the violence.
However Watchmen Comic or movie were never a classic superhero story.
It was more the opposite, it never hid the violence (at the time of the comic or the movie, no superhero story showed this kind of ugly violence), the whole violence had a deeper meaning. After watching the pilot episode i liked it very much, Regina king character is very good. Moreover all those bad reviews are just perplexing. I get it they might be watchmen fans but the reviews are totally biased here. This is a bold show, and the opening scene was very good too. All you people giving a poor review after only 1-2 episodes because its not "the comic I remember" obviously dont understand what an adaptation is. They are using an existing world to tell a story, not super original in that sense, but the story is attempting something new. They are also using that to keep up with current events such as racial issues and police reform. Dont be upset that the world is changing and you cant keep up. I'm sorry, At least you know with the stench of bleach lingering, there has to be something clean nearby, even if it is lurking in the toilet. Typically, a good pilot will introduce you to exciting and original characters who are dealing with a problem. The solution to which is what keeps you coming back for more. Reputation is all that has me hooked (for lack of a better word) because 95% on RT means the critics have seen more than one episode, right? The seminal Moore / Gibbons masterpiece is so unique that trying to adapt it or make a sequel using its own language seems like a lost battle. And we do have Snyder's version, which was a direct translation of Watchmen universe. So I am on totally intrigued by Damon's vision for this series, which (just guessing) deals with the consequences of Veidt plans in a not-so-different-from-ours world.
Had this series been released after Lost I would have had many doubts regarding Damon's ability to pull it off, but after the amazing Leftovers I am totally in for the ride It's thematically and stylistically inspired by the book. It's good, and asks some of the same questions as the book, but from new angles. It's clearly being review-bombed by angry internet boys. Comparisons to the graphic novel have been numerous, so I'll skip speaking about how this show is barely related to the originals.<br/><br/>I don't like the writing. It's boring. There is a lot of filler. I found myself yawning too often and using the fast forward feature to skip over 10 second segments. With out this fast forward feature, I would have died from boredom.<br/><br/>You know when writing is crap when you can skip over huge segments of the show and still know what is going on by stopping every once in a while to see an action scene or dialog between main characters.<br/><br/>You could literally cut out 40 minutes from each show and show 10 minutes and know everything there is to know about the story.<br/><br/>The characters are terrible. There are a few that I was interested in, but the rest of them were worthless. I didn't care if those individuals died or lived.<br/><br/>Lou Gossett Jr was a non-impact. His acting skills were wasted.<br/><br/>While there are some individual scenes which were good, the rest of the show is not worth my time. Overall, meh, I don't care if they make any more. One season was enough for me Amazing series that takes a few episodes to reach its stride. Slowly storylines from the original book make its way into the series and the blending of the two into this updated world makes for an amazing show. For adult fans of a serious book this will blow you away. Un-relatable characters, the action scenes do not work, the story is a mess.
Maybe the producers and directors need to go back to school and learn how to make a decent show that captivates the audience. Or... they could continue to try to target the woke demographics hoping for the best.
If the target is social issues in America or the world there are plenty of real events to choose from, no need to dress it in a "carnival freak show". Based on the first two episodes I am living for this show! Regina King is a brilliant actor and the writing is thrilling!<br/><br/>Shocked at the negative feedback about the "political" theme. All the poor white supremacists getting all upset that this being bashed?! And I thought we were the snowflakes The watchmen graphic novel was a critique of the Nixon administration so the political themes should have been obvious from the get-go. That being said I do not agree with the lefts being promoted as the hero's
But maybe there will be a change in the way we see it. I'm willing to keep an open mind creatively about the show but I do not agree with the politics Set in a time post the events of the original Watchmen, this new and brash interpretation of Watchmen lore takes a bold stance by interweaving the modern political age into what could, potentially, be an amazing and difficult story.<br/><br/>Don't go into this expecting Rorshach and Nite Owl - you aren't going to find them. What you are going to find is an allegory for today's burgeoning race divide in Trump's America. Beginning with a fantasised depiction of the Tulsa Race Riots in 1921 - this series then puts its foot down hard on the pedal and doesn't let up, it's intent is clear - the series is set in a broken place that isn't too dissimilar to where we are now. Yes, it's a comic book representation and therefore some of the events are caricatured and inflated but the message is still there - everything we fear is bubbling just under the surface.<br/><br/>Bringing in some new characters that were not in the graphic novel, it feels like the Watchmen are not held in as high regard as they were in their glory days and may even be as much a part of propagating the current problems than solving them.<br/><br/>Only 1 episode in and stylistically its bang in the money - offering a fair few Easter Eggs for those who know. I'm hooked already and looking forward to seeing where this goes.<br/><br/>This may not be for people who were expecting a recreation of the Graphic Novel - it's not the same timeframe. It may also not be for people who don't either want, like or agree with with the politics it's portraying but the truth can hurt! Just because it's mirroring what some simple minded people actually believe in, doesn't mean it's Woke - it just means it's relevant. This show probably will be one of the best in this year. HBO's TV series usually give audiences a huge number of information in the beginning (if you watch carefully, you can find lots of details that tell you some necessary background knowledge), I think that's why some people get confused and give a very low score.
The show doesn't share same history background with original Watchmen (race conflict vs cold war). But you can easily find the relationship between the show and original comics. The way this show expresses under the background of race conflicts is similar to the way the comic&movie does under the background of Cold War. We still can't be sure about what philosophy this show is trying to tell us since there is only one episode. But whatever it is, it's definitely something meaningful, like the great Alan Moore's Watchmen.
Besides, honestly I must point out that this show is very unfriendly to non-watchmen fans. If you don't know original Watchmen very well, you will miss a lot of important details.<br/><br/>BTW, just a guess no spoilers. I think that Chief is the second Nite Owl.
And the 7th Cavalry probably know some truth about Rorschach's diary. While I'm not familiar with the comics I recall the prequel film. This show, to me at least, comes off as the "Agents of Shield" for the Watchmen series. While we don't directly get a look at the interactions of the main hero's from the film, we get a look into their universe during the modern era. I appreciate how they took an actual historic event & included it into the plot to create dialogue & perspective. A lot of reviewers are uncomfortable with the fact that it delves into racism, even in a fictional universe, that parallels the real life world we have lived ever since the creation of the USA. While this may make some people uncomfortable, it tells the hard truth that some don't want to face while being entertained. To those who have lived life with open dialogue about these issues & even lived them, it's refreshing to see the spin they have taken & the route by which to present the story line. I'm very interrelated to see where this series goes. Watchmen is unbelievably original, brilliantly detailed, socially conscious, and, without a single bad performance, serves as a gripping and unpredictable continuation of the original comic series without ever feeling like a superhero show. Only 4 episodes in, I can see this serie is going to be something special. The character designs, the cinematography and the world building fit perfect with the Watchmen comic feel.
The weirdness and goofy tech of the serie is great. It makes you curious about the world and the big scheme that is going on. After every episode I can't wait for more and I think it is one of the most interesting design and world I have seen so far this year. It stays true to the comic.<br/><br/>Don't try to find meaning in every detail of this world, it is the Watchmen comic. It is a good and grounded story based in a surrealistic take of an alternative future.<br/><br/>It has the HBO stamp of quality. If you like Westworld, mystery, comics. This is a must watch! Recently watched the 3 episode of the series so far loving it great story so far and expected the same throughout the whole series....on first I'm little confused than 2 episode I understand the choice that hbo are making so far loving the watchman series......<br/><br/>Every one should watch it.....great story so far..... For all you people saying it's nothing like 'YOUR' Watchmen, read this, this is what Watchmen was about, stop being daft and offended.<br/><br/>"Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and satirize the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate break-in was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement." It's beautifully shot and acted. We're only two episodes in and the story is coming together. I read and loved the comic back in 90's, and so far I'm loving their take WM universe 35+ years post Dr. Manhattan, Rorschach and the giant squid. I can't wait to see where it's going. It's only the 2nd episode, even West World took time to together.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, most of the bad reviews I saw said the same thing race... politics... race... when they should just say they're only interested in seeing triumphs and tragedies of a particular race. After the first episode I was left looking forward to more. Great production. Plot seems facinating and I can't wait to see where it goes. Well done HBO. I loved the episode. It had very few, if any, deadpoints. As a continuation of the Watchmen graphic novella, the show definitely works for the time being. I'm very excited to see where the show will go over the next few episodes, and if the show will keep up the momentum. Quite a talented cast, very interesting writing. There's gonna be a lot to analyse with this show. For example, apparently, when fully distanced from "their enemies'" actions, the dangers of being a cop are now fully apparent to me. The pilot is supposed to be the most important episode the serie, I think they could have done more. They could have played more with the character's introduction, her past and other factors that made her become who she is, and also... What happened to the other Watchmen? They did a great job on quoting the comic in scenes where Dr Manhattan appears and also the smiley face though.
Overall, it's a good episode, but they could have done more in terms of mentioning the actual past that drove Tulsa become the city where cops where masks everyday. And just another thing... I think the music when there are driving shots is great, very retro, but what's up with that rap beat that lasted almost half of the episode, they could have done something more congruent, but anyway, good episode. I will get into the show itself, but let me just start by adressing the elefant in the room: a lot of the reviews you will find in this section were made by people who didn't bother to watch the entire damn thing. I mean if you really want to criticise something at least watch it so you know what you are talking about.<br/><br/>Now, about the show itself, it's not flawless. It is a slowstarter. it bets to much on origin stories and background build, lacking a bit in meaningful action in the beggining, but it does pick up the pace as the episodes go by and it finishes strong, although the season finale is arguably not the best one from the pack.<br/><br/>Also i assume this might not be everyone's cup of tea, it has a very dark tone, kind of nonsensical sense of humor, touches a lot of political nerves, and might confuse a lot of the average viewers with the akward storytelling flow.<br/><br/>With all that said, Watchmen has some of the most beatifull aestethics you will ever see on tv, and the writing really picks up around episode 4 or 5, making this a must watch if you enjoy this genre. A lot of the reviews on here are either 1 star complaints about how the show is trying too hard to be overly woke or how the politics are completely skewed or it's a 10 star praise of how the director is bringing real world problems to tv. If you can't set aside politics from a tv series, then it's your own fault. The show is also set in an alternate timeline and they make that clear within the first 15 minutes of the pilot. If this show came out at a time when our country wasn't so divided, I doubt anyone would have a problem with it because the show is very well produced, written, and directed. This show doesn't fill the gap that game of thrones left but it definitely has the potential to do so given some time.<br/><br/>Ps: to the idiot who said the pilot left you with more questions than answers, THATS EXACTLY WHAT A PILOT IS SUPPOSED TO DO White writer be like "white people be like", but they the white people be like After long anticipation and wait for this release I was pleasantly impressed with what the first episode had to offer. It contained enough action and suspense to instantly want to watch more, yet it seems the generic wide audience are left offended with the lack of "Marvel Universe" clique fast paced intensity.<br/><br/>This first episode had some great nods to the original film and plenty of neat littler Easter eggs that will no doubt make a recurrence throughout the series. The direction, editing and cinematography were all well executed, not to mention great acting and score.<br/><br/>Please for the sake of this project getting cut short, do not listen to the stupid reviews complaining about more race propaganda in America and continue to watch with enjoyable intent. It has very little to do with the original story. For someone who is not from the USA, this TV series has absolutely no substance and it lacks a good story. I've watched the first season but I don't recommend anyone to waste their time with this. Set in the same universe as the comic book this not-a-sequel uses the original concept to extrapolate a possible future story using some of the same characters and referencing some events; it's not a prequel, a reboot, or a sequel.<br/><br/>The TV series is set in Tulsa. Cops wear masks to protect their identities. Their guns are locked and unusable until they are activated on request by a superior officer. Rorschach mask wearing alt-right members roam about doing very bad things to minorities in search of achieving white supremacy, their anger at white privilege emasculation serving up paranoia and hate while it makes an insidious power grab.<br/><br/>The whole thing kicks off when a white man is hung from a tree and Regina King's Angela Abar / Sister Night discovers the body. We're quickly introduced to series regulars Hooded Justice, Looking Glass, Red Scare, and the Seventh Kavalry (the alt-right hoodies). Dr Manhattan is on Mars. Silk Spectre is an FBI agent. Adrian Veidt is holed up in a secret country estate.<br/><br/>Ostensibly the plot involves finding out who's behind the hanging, but Abar's journey takes in some flashbacks that round out the history of what's happening in Tulsa and her own journey to becoming a cop, before uncovering a greater conspiracy. Not everything is quite as it seems and the story veers off on numerous tangents, various characters get their fair share of the tale and give the series some heft. There's enough weirdness and quirkiness to keep things moving along at a good clip, but it's Regina King's commitment to her character and the emotional rollercoaster she goes through that is the beating heart of things. She carries the whole show, and kicks ass doing it.<br/><br/>At only 9 episodes there's plenty to chew on with not very much fat, and the final episodes are very satisfying. The terrible rating on this is just criminal.The way the plot develops and at the pace at which it develops is masterful to say the least.I've never left a written review before in my life but seeing the terrible rating on this show i felt obligated.The world building,the acting,the cinematography and the soundtracks are one of the best I've ever seen,which is really saying something because I've seen alot of shows.100% must WATCH !! I am totally blown away by the segues they do between scenes.<br/><br/>As far as the story line goes, the only people getting their feelings hurt are white supremacists and people that haven't read the original comic. Since most of the first can't read, they wouldn't have read the comic anyways. ðŸ¤£ Well done HBO. Smart show. I had high expectations for this show and your teams delivered. Only giving it a 9 because I felt is was a little too over the top on the violence and blood? So glad a show like this was able to deliver at this level. So good. What wast that? The lead and Don Johnson did a good job but they don't have that going forward, so????????? I kept waiting for WATCHMEN but the only hint of that was a TV show playing in the background from time to time. This is a BLM show about the klan and how silly that all was. It is liberals trying to stir the hate vote with fake stuff that doesn't exist. It is uplifting to know that the left does not have any real KKK or BLM stuff in the world so they have to push stuff that happened 100 years ago or make up a fake future where these things exist. The music did not work here. The action scenes were good but then the violence was behind doors so you were guessing what was going on. The lead is good -- solid work there -- but too many questions. They need a strong 80s rock soundtrack. They need some smiles and dark humor like the movie had. They need the WATCHMEN, not a cop in a mask pretending to be a superhero. And the jazz hands are overwhelming! Everyone in this show is gay? Lots of hard core man/man stuff and not a single scene of women? Really, what is this? It needs to get better fast or it will not be renewed. Definitly not the book or movie! And it's true. Lindelof who's made this show made the leftovers as well, a true 10/10 show. In thst show, he spent 5 episodes building different characters' story before the whole story really began moving forward. It's the same here. This isn't a fix you just get the second you open it, this is something you savour, and real class takes time.<br/><br/>This isn't for the "entertain me!" teenagers who expect to be wowed from the first 5 mins they begin a show, this is for people who understand that a good story develops at its own speed. No, you won't be blown away after the first episode, but you will be curious, and over the span of the following episodes that curiosity will only grow and you'll be amazed. I am appalled by this show. As a black American, I actually found myself siding with the white supremacists. This show makes the protagonists into evil villains and makes the intended antagonists into normal people Really not many redeeming qualities to this show. I can tell you as someone born in Tulsa Oklahoma that it is a pretty messed up portrait of the city that is not grounded in any of the current culture.<br/><br/>The race riot was a dark time but it was 100 years ago (a quarter century before Nazi Germany). No one is alive today that participated in those events. This is like making a show about how the Germans are all secretly still Nazis working underground to still go after the Jews. I can't say for sure but I'd bet Germans would not be a fan of that premise, but what I can say as a native Oklahoman is that it is disappointing to watch.<br/><br/>Honestly, this show just uses race baiting as the central plot theme. It's a cheap and lazy narrative that is played out to the point that I think both black and white people are tired of it.<br/><br/>And it has nothing to do with the comic or the movie adaptation. Maybe its a little slow, and it takes some thinking, but the story telling is perfect, the visuals hit just right, and I think the themes are very appropriate for engaging with modern social issues. Its not the type of slow where I feel disengaged, but rather where I am anxious for the next bit of action, and it never disappoints.
Episode 6 and 8 belong in top ten episodes of any show ever. You have to hang in there for the first 2-3 episodes as it is a lot of story building and some people don't have the patience for it, but the payoff is so incredible. Preknowledge of the Watchmen Universe is not a prerequisite, but it helps. An absolutely superb series that brings the 1986 graphic novel into modern times to explore familiar themes in a new and unexpected way. That being said...<br/><br/>....if you are looking for an Avengers-esque, good guys beating up bad guys in spandex suits who spout catch phrases this is not the show for you. If you are an uber nerd whose only wish is to relish in feelings of nostalgia by having the same old characters and plot lines regurgitated into an HBO series this is not the show for you. This show is for those who are looking for an edgy and cerebral look at what it means to be a superhero in our world as it really is from the perspective of a woman of color.<br/><br/>In negative reviews I've read, some have said that the show is too "political". Unfortunately I feel like this is a case of people using the the word political to describe situations or themes they themselves find to be uncomfortable such as race/racism. It's another Hollywood attempt at race baiting, production is good but cannot recommend as it will alienate a big portion of the audience due to its lies at attempting to stab a jab at Trump and the lies he's racist and his support as being whie supremist which is a lie, seen two episodes and it's enough for me. Don't bother with this miserable dreck. HBO has utterly failed in this re-imagining of the Watchmen universe. Sanctimonious race-baiting is not going to keep viewers loyal now that GOT is over. Sound, picture, details, atmosphere - everything is amazing! I'm seeing a lot of angry purists on here who can't see past the changes. I'm choosing to look at this through new eyes.
This wouldn't be the first permutation of a DC franchise.
We've all seen the Batman universe reworked with varying degrees of success.
I think they're off to a good start. I have lots of questions, but that is what an inaugural episode is for. It's highly stylized and I've always been drawn to stories that deal in alternate realities.
I'll be watching! This show is brilliant. It's an original story but it's definitely the Watchmen. Once you get a few episodes in the pieces start falling in place. Now to be honest, we are in an era where a lot of people hate when shows touch on racism. If you're one of those closed- minded people then that's your loss for not giving this show a chance because this show is more than that. I don't understand how this possibly has so many low reviews. Let me start off with, I have only seen the Watchmen movie, however my partner has read the graphic novel. We both think this show is amazing. Sure, it's different than the source material, but I still can feel the watchmen vibe there for sure. It's engaging and I feel like the episodes fly by. Everyone is saying "nothing makes sense" well it's only 3 episodes in? What do you want them to do, tell you everything episode one? Get it together people, this is a fantastic show worth your time. This story should be called something besides Watchmen as it does not live up to the groundbreaking book in style or substance. It may develop into an interesting storyline but you shouldn't expect a series that goes deeper into the ideas and concepts dealt with in the book. I had such high hopes fir this series. Regina King is such a good actor, but here she isn't given anything to work with. Horrible and unimaginative writing leads to a wasted hour. The only benefit to this show is the Trent Reznor soundtrack. This show is so far from the source material that the original author wants absolutely nothing to do with it and would rather die than endorse such a butchered and shaky adaption.
The whiny fanboys and girls that give this a positive rating just to counter out the ratings of people who actually read the original comic are just trying to push some kind of political agenda which frankly is not relevant to a DC comic book written out of this era and likely have never had a comic book collection, and wouldn't show this series to this kids anyway. That completely devalues the opinions and makes this show for all the people who watched every episode of GoT but haven't read a book since high school. First, I'm giving this show a 10/10 to push the review score up, since ignorant, stupid snowflakes are review bombing this show and this might be a problem for new viewers.<br/><br/>A show should not be reviewed seriously with only two episodes on air.<br/><br/>So, far this show deserves a 8/10. Really well written, intriguing and got me hooked. This score might go up or down as the show progresses.<br/><br/>What it definitely does not deserve is less than 7.<br/><br/>I might update my score if this show ever reaches a fair overall score.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Having said that, there's absolutely nothing too political, leftist or anything of that nature. And I am an overall critic of the left.<br/><br/>So, please, ignore those people. The only possible reason where anyone would consider this show too political, propaganda, "white-guilt", etc. is if you didn't watch the show and is here just trolling, or if you are an actual racist. There's no other option, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch the show. The TV show from even its first moments is unwatchable politically correct crap. They've taken a great special concept with the Watchmen, and made it into a left-wing diatribe. It's smelly crap only for the most woke audience. This show is literally begging for anybody with sense to pull the plug permanently on cable and HBO. A well written series with great acting direction cinematography VFX
didn't expected it to be so good Don't watch this expecting it to be a continuation of the movie or following the comic book. Completely unexpected and enjoyable if they continue the same intensity throughout. Don't watch if you are overly sensitive to the current affairs of the nation. If want to enjoy a good action drama this is it. Kick back and watch and enjoy. I'v only just started watching this ,i'm 6 episodes deep now.I have to say that this show is very well put together,the story,the writing,and the acting is top notch.Its very dark and there are some very powerful images to be displayed here .The photography is brilliant .I'm putting this on my wishlist for a dvd on amazon. I gave this a stinker of a rating because I thought it was glossy garbage, but it's a slow burner that's picking up speed, particularly after last week's episode. Largely thanks to the Adrian Veidt thread. Can't wait for the latest episode! Rorschach journal: this show is exploring watchmen of modern times. Also keep in mind there is a build up with multiple plot holes it's up to us to tune in and fill in the gaps. People want to see action right away and dont truly care for patience for story arks. So keep it together folks let's use our head. Same creator, so if you like that series you should love this. Should be full of surprises. Read the comments from the world. Not the US, the world. They're all sick of these liberal fantasies. Everything they're churning out nowadays is either about the "Big Bad White Man" or something terrible he wants to do. The comics are about everyone suffering. This show is focusing on oppression on a ridiculously one sided scale. It's typical of everything out there anymore. This is not what The Watchmen is or was ever intended to be. I can't believe how bad they have butchered something I've loved my whole life with their seriously misguided agenda. I'm not sure what happened to telling the story as it was intended instead of trying to pacify a ridiculous idea. For those of you not familiar with the original Watchmen series Rorschach was a vigilante who fought crime, at first not killing his victims who were rapists and killers and then becoming more violent by killing them with no mercy.<br/><br/>Here we have a series that takes place after the death of Rorschach who's journal is published in a right wing racist newspaper which is misinterpreted by the Seventh Kavalry, a white supremacist terror group who dress up using the same black blotted mast used by Rorschach. In the HBO series it cleverly references the original series in newspaper headlines and other innuendo.<br/><br/>If you are expecting the HBO series to be an extension of the original comic series you will be very disappointed. It truly has nothing to do with it. The problem is the topic the authors brainstormed to land on a white supremacist group using the Rorschach doctrine as it's calling card. It just doesn't hold water.<br/><br/>I gave it 7 stars because if you can ignore any reference to the original series and think of it as a stand alone series it's not bad. Knowing the background of the original Watchmen graphic novel gives credibility to the critics of the HBO version and has little to do with politics as some here seem to try so hard to believe its all about politics. Its not. A post Rorschach series could have gone in many directions. However the writers decided to intentionally make it controversial which leads to political overtones. They are getting the criticism they deserve and likely anticipated. Really liked the first episode and looking forward to the rest of the season. Acting was great and storyline even better<br/><br/>Only comment: the Sargent should of been played by Tim Allen. Well I have forced myself to watch because I hoped at some stage I would understand what it is all about?
No I never read any comic or anything related if it exists,so on that basis I have nothing to compare it with,however there is another tv show it does remind me of for its wacky storytelling and that is the Preacher.
Personally I gave up on that show by the 2nd season and if I am honest I mainly watched the first season only for the 3 main characters acting not the story which I never got to grips with simlair to Watchmen I have no idea what the story is about and because of it I most likely won't watch any future seasons if it returns
I prefer Good storytelling not the arty makes no sense garbage This is a well written well executed piece of television. Another example of crappy stupid scenario parasitizing on good film.The only dignity of this film is cast - actors really good, but even they can't save crappy scenario You rarely see a show with this much creative energy, stellar writing and imagery. For those not familiar with Watchmen cannon, it takes place 30 years after the original story. It seems other worldly because it is, and there is an acclimation period. But this story comes into alignment if you keep watching, and all is explained in a brilliant weaving of the narrative.
I imagine for those unhappy with the story it's because some people will be dissatisfied or uncomfortable, as in this is not what I signed up for, watching a super hero genre story with most of the "heroes" not having typical super powers (except for one) and/or don't appreciate historical racism inserted as a predominant theme in this fictional alternate reality setting which mirrors the reality of the human condition. There was an argument to be made that Alan Moore's beloved graphic novel (both in type and literal graphic violence) "Watchmen" should've been adapted into a TV series. Although I admire Zack Snyder's more straightforward adaptation of it back in 2009, writer Damon Lindeolf (Lost, Prometheus, The Leftovers) takes a different approach with the true TV adaptation.<br/><br/>This is a sequel in the vein of "Blade Runner 2049" with some dashes of "Twin Peaks", very much it's own story but building up to something more encompassing for what came before (the Oklahoma setting adds on a ton of atmosphere as well, and breaks away from the typical New York setting in many TV dramas).<br/><br/>Regina King delivers one of her potential career bests as crimefighter Angela Abar. Alongside her are a slew of striking performances from Tim Blake Nelson as Looking Glass, a sophisticated southern crimefighter, plus Louis Gosset Jr., Jean Smart and Jeremy Irons as new and old characters. There are plenty of throwbacks and easter eggs for DC fans to munch on as well. The themes are fascinating to watch unfold as they tie in with the novel and are culturally relevant today.<br/><br/>Some hurdles are present in the later episodes; the pacing can drag at times and CGI in certain scenes is hokey and lacks grittiness (especially compared to the 2009 film). These are smaller issues though in contrast to everything else on display that helps to follow up an almost impossible legacy to satisfy. As this will most likely be a one season and done deal, this is as good as it might get.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Grade- A- I watched the first episode when it aired and absolutely hated it. I can't think of any TV show I've disliked or ranted about more. But having read a lot of positive reviews I decided, just before the show ended, to give it another shot... and I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed episode two.<br/><br/>I've now watched the whole season, and it's a mixed bag. There were lots of moments of greatness, and I loved watching the pieces of plot clicking into place as it neared the end.<br/><br/>But Doctor Manhattan was reduced to a real nothing of a character - if he was just a man he would have been a very dull man, but he isn't, so quite why he was turned into something so bland and un-god like eludes me. It wasn't explained why, or indeed how, he fell in love with Angela. Given he could have his pick of a couple of billion women on the planet, why choose someone with such an unlikable personality? (I will admit to being rather surprised that in a show clearly striving to be woke he wasn't paired off with one of the men!)<br/><br/>Their entire "romance" was unconvincing from the beginning. Two boring characters being boring together. I'll bet it worked well in the script, but on screen it was a huge misfire.<br/><br/>Some of the casting was great, but for me Regina King (Angela) was a poor choice.<br/><br/>Overall then, I'm glad I watched it, but I can't help seeing what it could have been with some smarter choices. This can't be called watchmen. This does not hold in account anything that has happened before. The characters are bad. Don't waste your time. How do you take something that could be as stylized and dimensional and once again make it about race? 30 minutes in and I already had to turn it off. I am a big fan of Titans and other comic series so I was expecting to love this as well. I love Regina King so I feel badly for her. I was excited she finally got her own series but she made a poor choice. We do not need to have racism thrown in our faces. What we need are great strong minority role models to help us see nothing but that. I am also shocked that HBO picked this up. The writing is poor and disjointed and quite frankly bizarre in a non-interesting kinda way. This will be a one and done. This is my first written review after many years because this show is amazing. Ordered HBO after hearing word of mouth. Wasn't disappointed. If someone hates it, it's probably some sort of bias on their part. I hope there's a season 2 This is my first review on here, after watching (or more like TRIED watching) the first 4 episodes I found myself drifting off and falling asleep. I rather watch the news. Let me start by saying that it borrows elements mostly from the watchmen book, basin majority of characters on it, while introducing new interesting ones. The series captures the attention from first episode, with events happening at brisk pace in an engrossing and rich world. Dealing with themes of racism, vigilantism, cultism to name a few, it draws you in for a ride.
The cinematography is very good for a TV series. The acting added new depth while the characters of Looking Glass is my new Rorchasch.
What i did not like was the conclusion of story, and felt the writers trapped themselves into a corner. I Iike it because it reminds me of the craziness of the 1950's and the 1940's movies it isn't modern today stuff like laptops and other advanced technology, but it does have modern cars off and on. You never know what is going on because it jumps around era to era. I'm thoroughly confused but I'm thoroughly entertained. I have no idea what era it is taking place in. Like the "what if" that occurs in 1985, the russians attack us with some kind of mind blowing of the brain explosion. They never explain anything so I use my imagination. In total I like the watchmen. I hope there is a second season or a stream picks it up Hulu or Netflix I don't care which one because I have them both 😁 At first I thought this show was terrible. The themes seemed surface level and basic. The references were meaningless nods to the comic. The characters repulsed my attention with how uninteresting they were at first. The music was as distracting as the shallow allegories to American politics and social climate. The plot was at first very easy to predict and the one or two action scenes shown were boring to watch. The seemingly awful writing resembled the Snyder movie with too many maxims and bywords making up the dialogue. It was at first almost nothing like Alan Moore's Watchmen and more like Before Watchmen in terms of quality, subpar at best. The show seemed to be trimming out the core values, intelligence and vision of the comics, and leaving only the fats present in so many mediocre shows... but maybe all those blatant flaws were on purpose and the last three episodes have convinced me that was the case; a ruse to make fun of mainly Snyder's Watchmen but also other Watchmen spinoffs, and the Superhero genre in general. The last couple episodes have been some of the best Watchmen material since the original graphic novel, somehow capturing what it's like reading Watchmen except instead of Cold War paranoia it's focus is on racial tension, scaled down to solely focus on the United States while maintaining the severity portrayed in the comics, and recently has shown to have maintained the sharp detail on character motivations and flaws generated by the violently heated and exaggerated history and culture of the United States. In essence, HBO's Watchmen has almost captured the fundamentals... but the main characters remain uninteresting and frustrating where other side characters were developed so well in their dedicated episodes, almost perfectly to the point where it revitalized the intrigue and gravity of Watchmen lost after so many missteps from other creators. The music is still distracting and the plot is a little disjointed but now it's cleverly done and the visual metaphors carry weight and meaning, and so do the consequences of the doomsday event and characters from the original comics, no longer used for empty references but actually being extended and expanded. I do like the inspiration of the Seventh Kavalry being Rorschach. I thought it made sense given his twisted interests and personality although their relationship to the source material -which is essentially their origins- is still underdeveloped and leaves Rorschach's legacy in an unsatisfactory position with a lot to be desired. All in all, rough start though possibly on purpose, but that clever ruse doesn't excuse the writers from making the start terrible to watch, but now so far it's already a Watchmen story more interesting and rewarding than other Watchmen material that isn't from Moore.
This review will be altered in the future. So far so good.<br/><br/>The plot thickens now and people are jumping to conclusions. I see this is brilliantly put into perspective and not all is clear yet. The "woke" expressions came out as bolt out of the blue.. but later on it doesn't keep on happening. You just have to give them a benefit of the doubt and keep watching.
There are some scenes remarkably disturbing and i like it. Not for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>10/10 at the moment. Keep on watching the watchmen. I was not a fan of the original movie so wasn't expecting much but...wow!<br/><br/>This is a seriously amazing TV series. Movie quality cinematography, sets, cast, script.<br/><br/>This is a rollercoaster ride of interstellar proportions. Absolutely fantastic!!<br/><br/>A must watch!! Great update to the Watchmen. Maybe a little to PC or preachy in a few places, but the overall storyline is edge of your seat, can't wait for the next episode. Every actor makes their character believable. Should be on everyone's must watch list. I suspect every negative review here is from the butthurt snowflake MAGA cult. A war on racism..omg so woke and liberal. Go back to fox news and stop screwing up ratings. ...toward something great. I can sense a deeper plot unfolding which involves our old favorites, along with potential new, from Watchmen. I rate this a 10 because nobody seems to be giving this mysterious build-up a chance. Let's see how it plays out because like many shows before it, it could surprise us all. Great cinematography, great acting, interesting plot mixing old and new. Excited to see what may come out of this introduction we have thus far. Like everything on TV it has to be Black oriented right down to the hip hop music. They said this exists in an alternate universe, the same one the Lindleof guy lives in.<br/><br/>Sad that they chose to ruin Watchmen like this and I watched all of the last True Detective. Just another show attempting to be woke, going as far as to loosely appropriate history. I will be extremely disapointed if this series takes the oversaturated anti-racism/black pride/whites are evil direction, because that's 1000% not what whatchmen fans and the watchmen universe needs. The first episode was very well made and I enjoyed every minuite of it, so please creators, very please, don't let this be something so bold and dumbed down! (I am highly supportive of racism issues being addresed in certain films and series, but totally not in this one!!!) Couldn't get past the first episode. Don't waste your time. It's overly political and not interesting I'm so sick. Nobody an I mean as in whether your liberal or not. We dont want to see that sort of crap This show does not have a lot to offer and feels nothing like Watchmen.<br/><br/>The plot is solely based around racism, which is fine, except, theres literally nothing else it touches on. Which, in this day and age is trendy so it's understandable but does not stop it from being a boring and already ran into the ground type of plot. (We get it. The white man is evil...)<br/><br/>Lead actress is bad, some of the supporting actors are decent but not enough to make up for it.<br/><br/>The only reason this doesn't get a 1 from me is that the camera work, editing and soundtrack are all quite well done but cannot redeem lazy writing and half assed acting.<br/><br/>Do not recommend... The show is ok...its moderately interesting but also not what I expected in a somewhat indifferent way. 7 stars may be higher than it should be. My main issue is that the mystery has yet to seem compelling to me. Its comparable to the feeling I get if I lost an item or trinket somewhere in my house and I want to know where it is, but its not a super important item or trinket so I lack the motivation to expend energy finding it. This show is similar in that I want to know what is going on but its not interesting enough yet to keep my attention so I am a bit lazy about watching it. It is a hard hitting and brutal portrayal of a post Dr. Manhattan world. It stays true to the timeline based off of the graphic novel, while fans of the 2008 film can also appreciate the series.<br/><br/>I hope that anyone who sees this review will give it a watch as at this time the series is under quite a bit of scrutiny due to some political themes of the show. I think that this series will truly be one of the best debuts of 2019 and deserves to go on to fully flesh out the world created by Alan Moore.<br/><br/>It is unapologetically furious with its visuals and pace and does not hold back. At times the show feels slightly comical with its violence especially during a shoot out sequence involving cows, but I think this is due to the fact that a world with super heroes is hard to take seriously which even the titan of marvel has had trouble with at times.<br/><br/>The actors fully invest themselves and chew the scenery in the best way. Jeremy irons so far seems to be the only odd man out, something about his performance feels fake and forced. Although it could be the fact that his character interacts very little with "real people" either way it feels as if he misses his mark.<br/><br/>Overall my reasoning for giving the series an 8/10 at this point is it has me gripped completely even through its more mediocre points and it truely is a series made with the fans in mind. Firstly, let's get this out of the way. This is not Watchmen, the sequel.<br/><br/>Lots of people have said what it is - woke etc. etc.<br/><br/>My issue with it is that you've got the good guys, and and there's no ambiguity about this - they are the good guys, committing torture and carrying out extrajudicial killings. Seriously, WTF? Listen, I'll keep this as honest as possible.<br/><br/>First off, I love watchmen and when I heard about the show I was excited. Anyone with a computer could have found out that this show Is but isn't the watchmen from the comic. It's 30 years later. So to complain "this isn't watchmen Or the watchmen I know" is kind of useless. Literally 20 seconds of looking it up would have told you that.<br/><br/>Second. A lot of the complaints are about they use of race as a story line. While I do think that constantly using the race card as a plot can be lazy writing, it's too early, one episode in, to really form an opinion on this. I feel like at times racial tension can be forced on the audience sometimes. Let's see where this goes.<br/><br/>Thirdly. Some are upset that the lead is female. I could care less the main character is a lady. Gimme some good writing and it's all good. What I Do hate is always having female characters that are better in every single way then men and having to make male characters look like crap in order to make the females look good. Classic starwars move.... ugh I won't get into that. With that said, I don't think many people care who the lead is.<br/><br/>The show is new. It's been one episode... ONE!! And people are rating it a 2,3. Gimme a break. It's by no means perfection but as a whole, it's a sold hour of tv. It's a pilot for crying out loud.<br/><br/>So give it a shot. It's not as bad as people say and not a masterpiece yet. It's a solid beginning to what seems to be a good show. Only time will tell. Hard to even watch this crap... people are evil blah blah racist this racist that. So over this type of trash. One thing I really detest is being misled. This is not Watchmen but just another excuse for Hollywood to try and shove their politically motivated narratives down the throat of the viewer. Secondly this was just rubbish, story was rubbish, characters were rubbish and dialogue and actors were rubbish. I watched through to the 6th episode hoping that it would get better but it gets worse. I rarely give out 1 in reviews but this 1 is well deserved. I like where this is going. Timing is also good because racial tension is real right now. It's good to see writers taking this head on. Those that have given low reviews make me wonder where they stand or if they want to stay blind to this current climate. I'll continue to watch. Thank you Don Johnson for continuing to act and Regina is awesome! I barely ever write reviews but must come to the defense of this show for some stupid arguments against it. I'm a fairly conservative libertarian and didn't think anything was really that political. It's an alternate reality of America, and like our America today, there are some bad people out there who want to hurt people and some of them tend to be white supremacists. Displaying white supremacists as bad is not a political agenda, it's a reality, and sometimes it's uncomfortable.<br/><br/>But guess what, there are good white people too! Watch for yourself<br/><br/>I personally hate identity politics and am very sensitive to when agendas are pushed and i'm really just not feeling it here. And the bad guys wearing rorschach masks really isn't a stretch since Rorshcach was kind of a Trumpian old school badass kind of guy so it makes sense they memorialize him.<br/><br/>The negatives:
Weak leading actors thus far. Hoping more interesting heroes show up. Action piece was a bit poor.
Not enough context as to what the state of the world is like, especially America to pull the pieces together into a coherent story.<br/><br/>The Positive:
It's piqued my interest enough to watch next week. Some cool visuals styles. What will hopefully be a unique and interesting story. Dont miss it one of the best, and extremely underrated If it is considered as legend, or something irrelevant to the Watchmen franchise I would probably give it an 8, or more if the elaborating of the views could be more delicate in certain ways.<br/><br/>However, despite that it is still a fantastic creation, this is not the "Watchmen", only a imposter which borrows the world settings, characters, as well as a superficial representation of the concept of the masked vigilante. The depth, and the kernel of the story is complete shifted, if not reduced due to the coarse processing of writing and scripts regarding how the conflict is presented.<br/><br/>Besides, to some extent, it is completely insulting by twisting Rorschach's mask as the disguise of 7th Cavalry. Dr. Manhattan in the finale is also a joke compared to what was in the original movie. Have you ever listened an almost unrecognizable cover of a classic song and yet still enjoyed it? I have and that's why I didn't have a trouble to enjoy this new take on the Watchmen. So personally, I found it pretty useless to complain about being unfaithful to the source material. However, it's still subpar, because of some creative decisions on storytelling.<br/><br/>In Lost, Mr. Lindelof put more mysteries into the story than he could provide answers in the following episodes. When Lost finished, most people felt that they had been decieved by lazy writing. In Watchmen, he does the opposite but still managed to do it wrong again. Here, every mysterious event is explained in full detail, even sometimes unnecessarily. Instead of getting background on some incidents, I would like to see more action and/or additional subplots.<br/><br/>In the same vein, another good aspect badly executed was the origin stories. It's always nice to see the past of the characters. But here, we see two full heavily flashbacked episodes in a line for two seperate characters and that really makes the audience steering away from the main event. Wouldn't have it been better if we got bits of histories of each character, preferably spread through many seasons? Maybe the audience shouldn't (and probably doesn't) want to fully know a character and instead, a gradual introduction with plot twists is an indication of good storytelling.<br/><br/>Now all the mysteries are solved within the first season. And, we know everything about the main characters. I wonder how the writers could come up with an interesting story in season 2. This didn't "ruin Watchmen". And it isn't good enough to justify a $15 a month HBO subscription on its own like GoT could. It's probably not even good enough that I want to sit through 7 hours of it to see that happens. But it is good enough that I'll read the Wikipedia article about it after it's over and see what they came up with. And if that sounds interesting enough to actually see what is written, then I'll go back and give it a watch. I just finished the final episode. What a disaster! Very little makes sense or works at all. Unfinished plot lines. Incoherent story. A complete train wreck of a show. An abortion. A waste of the classic Watchmen characters - who should have just been left alone if this was all they had. The lead in this series is flat, does nothing, and is completely unlikeable. They bring back some of the classic characters and the direction they end up taking them all is abysmal. I hated this wretched show. It has NOTHING to do with watchmen. Don't watch this trash. Not worth it. Dont mind the reviews, this is well written and looks like it will kick ass. The first ep was very good to watch .. Of course you love it but wait what about the other episodes ... you producted garbage to us .. Thanks for making this one season Everyone here reading the reviews now knows this show's a train wreck, no point in going in on it further. What's surprising though is the sudden release of the new GOT series in my opinion. Seems a little rushed in spite of their new hit (NOTchmen) tanking. Will need a "sacrifice" if your to win my viewership back HBO. I wanna like it I really do. So much of the show is about race and I'm tired of it. Watching the 3rd episode now kind of wished it was tied in with the movie or book Tried to watch this by only remembering the first movie. Couldn't do it. Poorly written. Rewatched watchmen the movie. Didn't help If I am to compare it to Alan Moore's seminal work in the 1980's with Watchmen, this HBO series is in a terrible place.
Jeremy Iron's Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt is ridiculous, a buffon lacking only a laugh track to all the pantomime around him while the graphic novel is a mastermind and a force to reckoned with... And this is not the only shortcoming in this series.
By far it isn't as it keeps bringing stupidity in their versions and revisions of the comic book (Laurie working for the FBI, Dr Manhattan coming back to Earth and whatever it is they did to Moloch and mind control..), while pilling up s#1t as two conflicting forces of very caricature of villains come up with THE SAME plan.
But to be fair, the very first episode is really good and really intriguing, and things only go downhill after the third or forth episodes of the series. I was waiting for this show to come out since they announced it and...well you saw it for yourselves. Generic generic generic...all, the dialogue, the characters, the plot. I mean, the story itself could've been told in 1 or 2 episodes max, thecharacters are so plain and predictably unpredictable it's really annoying and the plot would've made more sense back inn the 1980s as the original one since back then the Ruskies had telekinesis or what not so Ozymandias "logically" developed a similar threat. Nowadays, this seems so stretched...I can see why many people seem to vote in favor of the series, however, but it seems they may have read the original novels in American and not in English. Too bad, hbo can do so much more, this title simply isn't worthy Of their production. The majority of reviews surrounding the show are completely unfounded. It is beautifully political and apt. I too am a die watchmen man and this is better than anything any of us could ever hope for Absolutely writhing this to screw everyone off... loved the movie and the comics, but this is supposed to stand on its own, apart from that, with its own bit of life.
Give it a chance, I think it might surprise.
If not... ah well, there's always marvel... lol. What's up with the bad reviews. Don't distract people from watching this masterpiece. Total garbage. A nonsense film. There is no storyline, and the characters seem to be some kind of - good - villan mixup superheroes. A minute is about a nuclear wawlr, next minute is about street crime. Also bad acting. A show about hate and racism, how original from the left. Ever wonder why they crank out shows like this? It's because they want it to come back and let's them reminisce of when they could freely wear klan hoods. When you get off on hate, that should be a clue to you. It could have been at least good! But it's boring and with disgusting imagery planted in for no bloody reason! Some of the music is fantastic!
I tried and watched 4 episodes and it feels like time has been stolen from me by my own faulty expectation that it will pick up! It's a piece of crap! I have to watch Die Hard 3 about 100 times now to remove the image of  catapulting bodies! The set designs are great, and it's shot well. All the new character designs are bland and uninspired. It's nowhere near as interesting as the original story, it just feels like we're getting the watered down,woke, & pandering version of it. I was appalled to read the reviews and realise how low the audience thinks of this show. I have read the comics and seen the movie and I love how the new versions goes beyond that. I am totally hooked to each and every episode. I like to rewatch it and dissect it into all its references and Easter eggs. I totally recommend it and hope its score on IMDb goes beyond the watchers' first impressions. Very interesting and exiting with depth. Great acting. It's nice to see a show whithout 20 year old people in lead. Hope to see more women in lead too. Those who give it low rates are crybabies. Most first episodes are kind of boring and it often takes sticking with it for a few episodes to get hooked. This first show was far from boring. Already looking forward to the second episode. Not sure what other reviewers on this site where watching. So it's not like the movie. Get over it. Thought the show looked good as well. Looks like some money was spent making this. You can't rate a whole series with just one episode, if you don't like the first episode go and rate the episode and write anything you want So the suspect in the pilot gets all his rights violated because he apparently is guilty of having a bias, which is not something they confirmed and backed up with any evidence, but simply deducted based purely on the hunch of the interrogator. Now, had the suspect been connected to, lets say, some advanced tech for lie detection, and it was evidently obvious that he is supporting, in this case, terrorist white supremacist groups, the beating that followed would be somewhat sensible and justifiable. Therefore I honestly doubt the audience can relate to the message which the creators of this show are trying to convey, to be honest.<br/><br/>But more importantly, isn't Hollywood tired from chasing this wild narrative? Wokeness is the new ideology. The indifferent citizen, that works hard trying to make a living and wants some relaxation, some real entertainment, which entertains but also touches on and truly explores the realms of morality, what is right and what not and other philosophical questions, will not forget all this garbage that is spewed from what once was an industry with an endless source of culture and ideas.<br/><br/>I am afraid in this case, the real bias sits with those responsible for this, well acted, but infinitely flawed storyline that is frankly insulting to anyone in posession of a functional brain capable of critical thinking. They are, to put it simply, trying too hard to show us through the TV, and their obviously subjective world view and lens what they think the world is like. They are guilty of what they charge. Actually it's quite funny and sad at the same time, that a show like Game of Thrones, which is a fantasy show, is much more relatable to viewers. Only if you tirelessly try to explore things like the vast complexity of human nature, try to vivisect peoples' motives and conduct through the actions of the characters you create, will you as a creator succeed in drawing the attention of the audience and hook them to your story. If you bash aimlessly at the imaginary things in your head, you end up looking plain silly. Wow. There are a lot of haters reviewing this show. I don't know how it relates to the movie/novel yet. It is too early (2 episodes). I will say that I am very intrigued. Regina King is amazing in it. The story is unfolding at a steady pace. I'm in.
It's is strange. It may or may not have a message. I don't know. It is a quality escape from reality. I'm going to watch it throughout the season. For me, it works.
I called this review "Relax" for 2 reasons. I'm relaxing and enjoying this unique show. And, "Relax" to all the people losing their minds about the shows supposed politics. That stuff is in their heads, not HBO's. This show cals itself Watchmen, and does several callouts to The ground breaking graphic novel, but the show it really wants to be when it grows up is Man in the High Castle, Jr. It has the same dark, slow exposition; the same smug self conscious tone, and some ham handed parallels to Trump-ism.<br/><br/>All that said, maybe this show will improve. Mr Lindelhof though, tends to take a strong premise and not know how to pull the bits together, substiuting vagueness for mystery. I saw the first episode. I love the movie. The show might be good. But I'm tired of politics, I'm over saturated. Don't take me for a this or that. I can't even see a pic of a fluffy kitten without some kind of political commentary on it. I miss the days when no one cared about politics. It's sad that all politicians can legally accept bribes via lobbying. Do I want to see a lesson about that over and over and over no. Is that what this show is about, no. That's what I believe but I don't need it in my face all day. So many trolls here.. Best show ever.... Incredible story.... Ã‰pisode 6 was incredible This review is based on first five episodes, and I have to admit I was wrong when I almost let this show go on without me after the first episode.<br/><br/>So far the writers have done an excellent job by making a whole new story with so many references to the comic book lore.<br/><br/>This show for sure isnt anybodys cup of tea, but if you want a thinking drama in a a sci-fi super hero setting, look no more. Nonsense trying to be original but nothing that makes you interested in the characters nor the story. There is no storyline or at least a storyline that is so far from being interesting that you fall asleep. The characters are supposed to be some kind superheroes or anti superheroes. Bad acting. Do not waste your time I gave it 4 episodes trying to give it a change and then I gave up. I have seen a lot of negative reviews for this show. Many stating that it's simple "pushing liberal propaganda and race baiting the audience" or complaining about the legacy of Rorschach. The truth is after the events of the graphic novel this feels like the natural turn of events that would occur in this world.<br/><br/>I have made it deeper into the show than the pilot, as of writing this review we are three episodes into a nine episode season and there have been many things that this show has nailed. The thing that people forget about Watchmen is that all of the original characters were exceptionally flawed and honestly terrible people. It's easy to get caught up in the fact Rorschach didn't want to let Ozymandias simply get away with his plan to unify the world but everyone seems to forget about the content of his journal which read like the manifesto of an extreme alt right terrorist. It is easy to believe that racists would adopt his face and use his words to fuel their hate.<br/><br/>Jeremy irons as an aged and more unstable Adrian Veidt has been very intriguing to watch and a high point for me.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the masked cop angle as well, since the Keene act made vigilantism illegal it would make things more difficult in that world for the police since there are no longer any masked crusaders to do the dirty work and keep the hands of the cops clean so why wouldn't some one power choose to make the police the masked heroes/villains the city of Tulsa needs, especially considering the history of violence in this version of Tulsa.<br/><br/>Is this show perfect, no but to me it has been brilliantly put together and the world makes sense. If you don't like your programming politically charged this isn't for you. If you believe any of the original Watchmen characters are decent people this probably isn't for you either but if you recognize the flaws of those characters and truly understand what Alan Moore was trying to convey in it and want to see what a world after Adrian Veidt unleashed a mutant squid would look like watch this show. Watchmen just works. It's intriguing, the cinematography and colour palette work well, and it retains elements from the graphic novel whilst not being bound to it. A woman lead worked well and this show is on the way to being one of the best of 2019 Don't believe the bad reviews. I heck it out yourself. It's way better then other shows. If you liked The boys you'll definitely like watchmen. Started quite bad , but I have faith. I think it's quite hard to mess up Watchmen. I think the era of binge tv has ruined this sort of thing for some people. You've gotta give it some room to breathe, I don't know why everyone wants everything all at once. And those complaining about the racial elements, are exactly why this aspect of the show is entirely necessary. Solid start, compelling story and above average acting, I cannot wait to see more! Superb first episode! Intense & mysterious. Great music! Elegant reference to real world tragedies. Def like Watchmen (the comic) but still something new. Original and dark in its own special way. Magic realism meets dark superhero drama at its best. Potential to set a new standard.<br/><br/>While the novel was charged with loads of political references, the movie was not. In that sense this series seems to be closer to the former<br/><br/>Also - the music! The opening was just amazing. Must watch the whole series. Impressive sets, cast and storyline is the best one. Is this the worst show HBO has ever made? Or am I forgetting another? This TV show is setting up a fantastic alternate timeline, expanding on the ideas of the comic book in exciting ways. I hope it continues to be as strong a series for the remainder of the season. I'm going to keep this short but this show is just hateful nonsense. We get it that Hollywood wants to keep race baiting America but this isn't even well done enough to hide it. Regina you are such great actress. Don't get sucked in to this kinda mess again. This is television and film making at its finest! I will admit that I'm upset that it isn't not getting the recognition it deserves, but I'm absolutely sure it will with time.
The storytelling is phenomenal, the dialogue is very engaging, and the acting is incredible.
I grew up watching Regina King in the series 227, and even at that young age you knew she was meant for stardom. Fast forward all of these years later, and you'll realize King does not disappoint. In Watchmen, you can't take your eyes off of her; King delivers in every scene she is in.
The casting for this series was extremely well thought out, every character absolutely shines.
The writing and dialogue however are what really stand out the most. Watchmen really tackles difficult subject matter with all of the depth and complexity that it merits. Interesting and engaging. Ignore the trolls that seem to think this adaptation is to "snowflake". Shows you the world we really live in, not to far off from this fictional one unfortunately! The first episode was inadequate in every way! Switched off after 40 minutes could not bear it anymore. These big budget shows should really improve their storytelling ability or these networks/streaming services will lose viewers. I was really looking forward to this so disappointed!! I think the Watchmen graphic novel is excellent. Based on the first episode and characters in the cast list this is not even a loose adaptation of the graphic novel. Most the major "heroes" are not present Some people may enjoy this show and that is great but it has almost nothing to do with the Watchmen graphic novel. Watchmen
I love it but not this series Those charming characters With a series of blacks now replaced, really frustrating Don't look at the negative reviews, most of them are negative Because its "woke". Those people didn't watch the episode and they have nothing better to do so they review Bomb everything that is considered "woke". This show is very good please give it a watch. Slow, slow, slow. 3 episodes In and no further forward. I keep getting emails reminding me to watch. No thanks! The series have pretty much nothing to do with the original watchmen or the story. It's a typical "woke" story from american political culture that doesn't fit very well with anyone outside this demographic.<br/><br/>"Wokemen" would be a better title since "woke" politics is what this tv-show is about. It's not what i expected but i also think that you shouldn't judge series by it's pilot and i'm hoping/believing that it will get better , oh yeah and i like the soundtrack I am basing this review on the first episode which I just finished viewing, and it has certainly left me eager to discover more. I really like the way they have fleshed out the alternate timeline involved in this story, and I always felt it was something missing from the original source material.<br/><br/>I can see that some reviewers are upset by the political outlook that's expressed here, but I would urge them to keep watching. From what I've seen so far, it seems deeper than what appears on the surface. I don't want to give any spoilers, but the presidential situation is a polar opposite from the movie.<br/><br/>On a side note, they really need to put Don Johnson into more roles. He has a surprising versatility and humanity to him, especially in this particular story. The first ep was pretty good, it gave an intro to the idea of what's to come. I particularly enjoy gratuitous violence and the fact the lead is a woman even better. I'm sick to death of women being wives and mothers in the background. There's a lot of whinging around the pilot and I don't think the whingers realised its a sci-fi show. I think it will be good. But if it's not I'll change my review. You should not give a show 7 Stars simply because you support the the diversity of the cast. There are ways to have a diverse cast without having bad writing, or bad acting. While the show may have a diverse cast, it is bad acting and bad writing taken to an art form. A slow start quickly turns into a television epic. One of the best shows I've watched in a long time and stcks to the original material quite well. Would highly recommend watching this show. Apparently many people don't get what's going on here, namely that it's a continuation of the influential 1986 graphic novel, not a remake. So what is the problem? Don't like that it's mostly about and with black people? Hey, it has atmosphere, interesting characters, an intelligent script, good music and great production values. I mean, look at the other super hero series that were made over the years, you would think that 95% of the world population is white. It was about time for a change! If you liked Westworld, The Leftovers or Legion, then watch this. These haters clearly don't recognize excellent cinema, tight storylines, and whiz-bang production. So, stop reading reviews, familiarize yourself with the original series, sit back and be mesmerized. Simply great performances all around. This previous review captured how I felt about this series very well:<br/><br/>"I'm two episodes in and anything that resembles a plot is yet to reveal itself."<br/><br/>I haven't read the comics nor seen the movies. Perhaps that's a prerequisite to understand anything of this, because to me this was an absolutely incomprehensible plot. Watching this left me with a serious amount of confusion as to what the show is trying to do here.<br/><br/>There are some positives to point out. The production value is cleary high, the main actress pretty good and convincing in her part, but the plot is all over the place. There is also some interesting world building hinted at. As this takes place in 2019 and has to continue from the timeline of the original Watchmen, they had to make up some things about how the world progressed done the time line. While as of yet it is kind of unclear whether the events surronding Veidt, Rorschach and the Comedian of the comics took actually took place in this universe or not, there is still some interesting things to notice: People use pagers and smartphones are nowhere to be seen. There are serious issues with the enviroment (including squid rains), there arent that many computers around, no tablets etc; but there are flatscreen TVs and holographic HUDs in cars. So there is interesting stuff in the world building, and thats a positive.<br/><br/>But the big thing, apart from the appearent nerf of Dr. Manhatten who still hangs out on Mars and this time can't constuct a literal sand castle compared to the complex glass clock we know he was able to pull off before, is the lack of any real connection to the well known Watchmen. There is a TV programm, appearently, about the popular characters, but that really is the only reference. This leaves the feeling, that the creators only use the Watchmen IP to tell their story and ride on the popularity of the IP in order to promote their story. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially considering that Rorschach now is the face of the antagonist organisation, which, *surprisesurprise* is white supremist. yawn. While the police uses faschist methods itself and Watchmen has always been political commentary of the time, this is getting boring.<br/><br/>The storytelling feels disjointed and the big (maybe) death at the end of episode 1 was even more predictable than Han Solo getting stabbed by Kylo in TFA. Literally no surprise.<br/><br/>This show might get better, but for now its a half baked attempt to craft a well-known and very populare IP on a PC narrative that is so popular to tell right. It is outright abuse to use the Watchmen for this, though, and I would be really surprised if the creator of the comic is fine with this. Involved in the show he is not.
Maybe the storytelling will improve, and the quality in which it is delivered, but serious doubts remain and in the end the show is more likely to "meh" audiences than engage them. Episode 4 was titled if you dont like my story write your own. We all wish the writer would have left the Watchmen story alone and wrote his own. Im hate watching at this point. What the blargh is this? It isn't Watchmen that's for sure! I totally agree with others in here, this is Wokemen. This is my first (and most likely last) review of any show, but I felt compelled.
I am assuming that a in order to obtain a positive review it would require a show to possess high standards in several areas of filmmaking. Excellent acting, cinematography, soundtrack and of course storyline are a few of the pieces that comprise a show worthy of a good review. As far as I know, being true to the original story is not a criterion and bias has no place in a review that wishes to be taken seriously.
That being said, after reading some of the reviews of the so called "trolls" who insist on giving the lowest possible ratings on this series based on their own personal allegiance to the comic book and the lack of similarity to said comic, I believe my review is an earnest attempt at an honest opinion.
The acting is excellent, the soundtrack is great, the storyline is exciting intelligent and somewhat original.
Overall one of the better series I have watched in a long time. I am entertained, and as far as I know, that's the point. Not quite a 10 but I had to counter the pointless low ratings. Seriously, read the reviews. I challenge you to find one that doesn't mention politics or the original comics. The performances and cinematography are both spot on, and the world building is intriguing if a little irreverent and odd. Overall a solid start. Everything nowadays is political to some degree. Complaining about it is doing the show a disservice Here we are beyond the free interpretation and development of an original idea. Here there is nothing original, it's all a tracing of things already seen and already heard. Brainwave soap opera style, clichÃ©, a politically correct forced and cloying. A masterpiece of comic literature folded, disfigured and violently outraged. And the overall result is absolute boredom. -boring returns to the past from the past that are boring backwards from the past that
were past when there was something that happened before the past, a memory from
a memory something that happened before
-they only show the inability of the crew to do something normal, my suggestion is to
start dealing with baking or something similar
+recommend for people with low IQ This is not a watchmen. It is more like a successful last jedi. If it had not been popular from the beginning, it would have praised the hyper space attack. No matter how good an independent element is, it's worst editing if you deny the probability that exists normally. The story all fits together, you just need to keep watching! Great acting, excellent storytelling, overall incredible! Very well done and should be enjoyed by every true American. This show is not only a bunch of crap, but is a cold slap in the face to anyone who loves the source material. How anyone who has read the the graphic novel or enjoyed the Zack Snyder adaption likes this garbage makes me question if they actually understood the points that Watchmen questioned about superheroes. Rarely seen this much wokeness in a single episode.
I tuned out after about half an hour into episode 1. I've never been turned off by show this fast. This series is just completely unrelated to the movie.... It's just some story about racism and some political mumble jumble... Though some of the scenes are well made... Acting is good..but the story is just not what we all were expecting. I only watched two episodes and found it so boring and extremely disingagable. The characters are so unlikable, the plot is racist and not understandable, and the fight scenes are stupid. I just don't know what to make of it; it's just not attractive to watch All that and a bag of Chips. My new weakness. Damn, who did this to us. AND you make us have to pay...attention. Damn! So slick. Very creative and intelligent show--watching it is like reading a book--you have to pay careful attention and let yourself be immersed in the reality they present. From the beginning moments going forward, this show is an imbalanced hodgepodge of unwatchable woke political correctness. It's also very tedious and boring in the worst unintended fashion. They've taken a great special concept with the Watchmen, and made it into a left-wing diatribe. This show is literally begging for anybody with sense to pull the plug permanently on cable and HBO. After seeing one episode I had enough. The flashback was really enjoyable after that it fell apart. I'm not sure why the show is called "Watchmen" it has nothing to do with the comic book. The charachters aren't interesting, the plot isn't interesting, the dialogue is laughable. This show has nothing going for it. It has a fatal flaw that I've noticed so many times, it's actually quite annoying that they haven't figured out a way to rebalance how votes are counted. A show comes on, and at first it's boring, starts slow, or seems dumb. Several episodes down the road, the show really takes off and becomes something really special Yet the rating is already semi-locked in... the voting is very front loaded and hard to change. Not as many people vote on a show several weeks after it begins as the premiere weeks. Something needs to change here(I'm not sure what the answer is exactly, but I have a few ideas), I'm not saying that the show is a classic yet, but it has improved quite a bit from the first episodes. Even if it becomes a classic, it's still going to be held back by the early voting. I'm giving a 10 to offset it, even though I don't think the show deserves a 10. First of all....this isn't the Graphic Novel, this isnt the movie. THIS IS AN ALTERNATE STORY...taking place in a different setting and time. If you expect this to be exactly like the GN or Movie, you are as close minded as the White supremacists in this show.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the visuals are awesome, the story is compelling and the narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love the alternate history of this show. It tackles past atrocities and current events and tells it's own story that is unique and compelling.<br/><br/>If you think those qualities makes this show bad, you have really bad taste in TV. I recently told my nephew that I was done with Superhero movies. They were all predictable and silly. Not Watchmen. Just finished the last episode of this first season. This is creative, exciting, funny, outlandish and intense. It is the exact reason why so many of us turn to Sci-Fi when we need to see beyond the mundane.<br/><br/>There is so much negativity here, because there are so many here who think this is about white racism and nothing else. These people are walking around with their eyes closed and they refuse to see. It is about so much more. Human frailty. A failure to love each other. A need to connect to the past and a future soon to be.<br/><br/>I don't understand the comments from those who said it was boring. As I've heard it before, only boring people will find this boring. This show engaged my brain fully, for the audacity, the humor and the stregth of it's ideas. I am looking very much forward to the second season. I agree with chris-86-114773's review but am more generous with my rating. Credit where credit is due regarding the stunning episodes. Until the last episode, I was "mostly" enjoying the ride. The last episode is almost 100% awful. The only saving graces in that episode are Regina King, Lou Gossett, Jr, Tim Blake Nelson and the incomparable Jean Smart. When any of these great actors are on-screen, it's tremendously enjoyable. But after so much build up in the first 8 episodes, I expected the last episode to blow me away but finished it feeling let down. I'm not a huge comic book fan but this show should be mandatory viewing. America is not ready to reckon with its sins. This show displays our country's true colors and its racist past and future from start to finish. The fact that this show did not get nominated by the Golden Globes makes me question the award system all together. I hope it stays on the conscious of the viewer which is more to win over. Well done, Damon Lindelof and the incomparable Regina King. I've read it, I've watched it, I read other comics and have seen adaptations.
This was beautiful. I won't lie, it took a few episodes to get it. I even did a rewatch after a few. I loved it. I loved the characterizations, the premise, the why and how. Regina King, I love you. You carried us through the uncertainty. Jeremy Irons, you stamped that letter the only way you could. The supporting cast, brilliant! Writers? Outstanding. The fact that people get upset about the politics is beyond me. This story was way more than that, just like most are and the series really captured that. The story wasn't about politics. If you don't get that, you never will. The first two episodes are brilliant. The time spent on explaining and showing the "alternate reality" is not worth the effort. I enjoyed "Westworld" and the "Leftovers," and watched several episodes of each twice to catch up on the intricate story line. But not Watchmen, instead I found my self fast forwarding through the ridiculously long scenes with Jeremy Irons and his ex wife's telephone calls to the alternate reality. So half of the Watchmen gets a 10 and the other half a zero for an average of 5. I love the acting, the characters, the dialogue and the cinematography. Lots of open questions about more or less everything and everyone even after 4 episodes, which is intriguing and makes me long for the next episode. I don't understand the super low rates people give it, but if you expect questions to be answered quickly you're better off watching Batwoman.
If you kept watching Lost to see what new craziness they would come up with, this is one for you. The writers appear to be trying to capitalize on current events in America and have completely ruined a great comic.
I was really excited about this show and have removed it from my list of programming.
Dont waste your time with this garbage. This update could not be any better! Completely in the spirit of the original graphic novel, but perfectly calibrated to our times.
It helps being a fan, as you get more of what they are trying to do here, so I think it might bring some people into reading the original story.
I haven't been as enthralled and enthusiastic about a debut series since series one of Westworld! This HBO's Watchmen isnt what you expect after watching Watchmen (2009) because it develops its own story and themes and events taken from real world.<br/><br/>This version looks a bit inferior if compared to the Zack Snyder's Watchmen adaptation. This is because the film talked, dealt and kept itself wide and wild by having its own power and fable to tell but in case of this TV series, if one forgets or ignores the events or themes or the actions of the characters for once, the film looks a sloppy period drama and nothing else.<br/><br/>The remixing is done by Damon Lindelof who hasn't understood or got the vibe in from the original creator Alan Moore which at the end isn't what it should have been. The series also drags on like why do you need to watch a thing for almost an hour where it could have been summed into 40 mins with good and smart writing?<br/><br/>Watch this if you havent the Watchmen (2009) version or consider the HBO will do hooded justice second time.<br/><br/>At last, I also request HBO to bring all the versions including the Watchmen (2009) comic style adaptation to HBO MAX so that we all can watch and tell DC still has more to show than just Batman and Superman. I like Watchmen, not the movie though. I always felt only series can do any justice to tangled and little-bit odd Watchmen world. When this series came out and i was into few episode, i was like justice is served to Watchmen universe. It had minimal complexity of various superheroes, which i saw as plus. Story was contentious and very well fitting. Great way to tell story of very first mask hero. There were some stupidity around Adrian, but overall story was good enough to ignore that nonsense. Clan was powerful and well connected, nice ingredients there. But then Dr. Manhattan happened.<br/><br/>When story of dr. manhattan came in to play, everything turned to crap very fast. Dr. Manhattan is not a character in Watchmen universe to take this lightly the way this series has taken. Adrian plan to escape from its adobe, is silly and demeaning to such powerful anti-hero. Its like write and director lost their motivation.<br/><br/>Sadly have to change my rating from 10 to 7 star. Will see how things goes in Watchmen universe. Great production and soundtrack. Superb action and special effects. Jeremy Irons storyline eally is the saving grace of the show.<br/><br/>Very slow burner but picks up with the last few episodes. Lots of untied ends throughout the over all story. Glad I watched it, although I very nearly gave up after 2 episodes.<br/><br/>The KKK angle was VERY weak and a let down of what the original masked vigilante was all about. So much time and effort put into them as the Antagonists of the series, only for them to be as threatening as a Poodle is to a German Shepherd!! Black vs White is a ridiculous one dimensional theme. No real depth.<br/><br/>The final episode wraps up all the major angles. Flawed and leaves questions unanswered. But not sure I'd be in a rush to watch season two. Guys trust me and watch this. It's different and definitely not your average story line. I feel like most of the negative reviews are from conservatives '. This show is based on an alternate world of what ifs. It's a dystopian world based in the year of 2019. It does show a lot of US history as a way of story building and developing the plot. It's only one episode so don't expect for it to be mind blowing but I do like it so far. Regina King is a phenomenal actress and I see great promise in this show. Watch and ignore the negative reviews After waiting for more from my favorite graphic franchise, it arrives and does not disappoint.
Kudos for taking the story forward. I hope the production will be able to maintain the level of excellence they started here, though it will certainly drag a bit when we get to exposition necessary for those unfamiliar with the Watchmen world. It is upsetting to see how Rorschach's world view has been sublimated, but then that view is no more innocent than The Punisher's, so deserving of spoilage. I wait to see where this goes. I love it. Don't need to tell you more then just watch it.. I've never felt so engaged with a TV show before. The world building was phenomenal and as someone who's never read the comics and only seen the movie once (it wasn't that good, sorry fellas) I wanted to find out absolutely everything I could about this universe. Plus the fact the poor, sad boys all hate it for being too "left wing" makes me love it even more! I read all these reviews and I can't believe how many people don't like the show. Better say how many people are so miserable nowadays. Just because it doesn't go according the way you imagined it doesn't mean it's not great. So far I'm hooked and I'll recommend it to everyone to judge it by themselves. Pay no attention to the 1 or 2-star reviews with no substantial criticism except they don't like having a black female protagonist or they don't like seeing white supremacists as the villains. It doesn't seem forced at all if you just watch the show instead of wetting yourself with rage the second she comes on screen.<br/><br/>For me, it definitely has that thudding perversity of the graphic novel, with an accelerating pace to the plot and enough twists to make a friendship bracelet with.<br/><br/>Recommended for any fans of the franchise. If you haven't read the book or at least watched the movie, do so first, as the callbacks and context of the original make the show better IMO. Absolutely can't get enough of this show. What an amazing concept to put this storyline in. I havent been able to predict any of the awesome plot twists and I'm always on the edge of my seat. Don't listen the negative reviews, yes this show is different compared to the original novel, but that's because it is a sequel to the graphic novel. After episode three the show began to improve and now after watching episode five I am so happy that I've decided to continue to the show. Also it captures the originals murder mystery and political feeling very well. Finally, the plot started to be more interesting and it continues to evolve, I'm really excited to see the rest of the story. I love the comic and this is a sequel that's actually good for once it takes everything about that comic and brings it to the 21st century by using the impact of the end of the comic to build a bizarre society that will have you asking questions for days The show is not worthy of a review. Seriously, if you are a fan of the comic or movie adaptation ten minutes of the first ep will be enough to tune out. Don't believe me? Go watch it.<br/><br/>Now the reviews. These people watching and reviewing Watchmen can't be taken seriously. My guess is that they are new to Watchmen and have no prior applicable knowledge in which to accurately review this show with context. It would be like me jumping on a honda rebel motorcycle and saying "wow this is great" having never been on any motorcycle and not knowing Harleys, Triumphs, and Indians exist.<br/><br/>So, in short if you are too young to know any better...have at it. I did not know about the Watchmen franchise until I saw the HBO series. And a great series it is. A combination of fantasy, science fiction, and historical drama, it hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>It also addresses an ignored part of US history: the Black Wall Street Massacre. This was when a white mob waged a campaign of terror against an affluent African-American community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing possibly thousands of people. An encyclopedia of Oklahoma history called it the single worst incident of racial violence in US history. Even now, they are finding mass graves of people slaughtered in that incident of sheer brutality.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this show, both for enjoyment, and to learn about this key part of history. None of it appeals.
The lead is bland and predictable.
Terrible music and score indicating beforehand what's going to happen.
Police as Watchmen, I'm out of here.<br/><br/>Only points for cinematography and Don Johnson. Where are the Watchmen? Not in this show. In fact, the only thing in common with the original story line is the name, which seems deceptive at best. This is nothing but propaganda. Note that the advocates for this train wreck will give it undeserved high marks and will malign anyone who does not like this BS. The show should be canceled. The TV show from even its first moments is unwatchable politically correct crap. They've taken a great special concept with the Watchmen, and made it into a left-wing diatribe. The result is embarrassing political propaganda meant to assuage "the woke". This show is literally literally begging for anybody with sense to pull the plug permanently on cable and HBO. This show was amazing from beginning to end. Great story line which ties in perfectly with the Watchmen Universe. As a fan of the novel and comics I think HBO did an amazing job adding their own twist. Watchmen is a very politically charged novel so to all the whiners complaining about the social and political implications can go and watch Vikings. Can't wait for what the season has in store! Great production as you'd expect from HBO. I never read the comics but the characters and story lines are very good. Very watchable. We just finish the first episode and can't wait to see more of it. All the negative reviews are just trolls looking to for something to complain about. What an univer, great script and story, and vey good acting, and Ost, i'm reading the comic of Alan moore now, this serie is ART People who saw the movie, didn't read the comic and live in our current political climate all took this as another example of entertainment pandering to blue check marks. They are wrong in this particular instance. This is a logical continuation, and frankly the best adaptation, of Alan Moore's source material.
Lindeloff... no more LOST references; you don't get the benefit of doubt on that one. I read the reviews and was sceptical of this series. However, it's a complex place in this alternative world of superheroes and each episode adds layers.
I don't know how it ends, but don't give up if you think you've got it figured after just one or two watches. Seriously, it's pathetic. If they actually bothered to try and invest in the narrative and look beyond feeling "attacked" because the show actually tries to offer up a perspective that's different than that of the prevailing white male, they might actually get some enjoyment out of it. But like the typical perpetual right-wing victims they are, they'd rather sit and whine and attack the show for having the guts to offer up some fresh, new perspectives and ideas.<br/><br/>Bigots/ supremacists are the bad guys. Period. End of story. And no one should have to explain this to half our braindead, potato population. America is rife with racial injustice (to this very day) and many Americans didn't even KNOW about the Tulsa Race Riots until this show premiered. It should rightfully be applauded for not only shining a light on this event but for exploring even more deeply the trauma associated with our history of racial violence in this country. The scene when Sister Night is finding out about Will and his connection to her was poignant and an important depiction for a lot of black folks, who often have never HAD that history available to them.<br/><br/>Additionally, this show is providing some amazing roles for women in the 40+ age bracket. It's obvious that the show writers are trying hard to offer up some amazing and intriguing stories while also telling some OLD stories to generations of Americans that have never had the chance (or will) to learn about them previously, through characters who are often overlooked or underutilized in prominent narratives. It is refreshing to see and a wonder to behold, especially with the superhero element underpinning all the mystery and drama that we get to watch unfold.<br/><br/>You don't have to have read or watched the previous iterations of Watchmen in order to "get" this new sequel, although it is helpful to understanding some of the returning characters like Adrian Veidt and Agent Blake. But one certainly needn't know the previous story in order to dive right into this new and exciting alternate timeline in order to fully enjoy it, especially since HBO has helpfully created the Peteypedia, a collection of FBI Agent Dale Petey's files and memos regarding different characters and events in the Watchmen timeline.<br/><br/>HBO is making better and more interactive, puzzle-like TV shows in recent years and it is incredibly rewarding for viewers who take the time to watch and analyze the shows they see. If you're a fan of Watchmen, Westworld, or any kind of storytelling that wholly invites the viewer into the carefully crafted world of the show creators, I highly urge you to ignore the trolls and give this show a chance; it's tantalizing, exciting, fresh, and on the fast track to becoming one of TV's most mysterious and fun offerings on tap today! What is going on? Bad TV it seems, a mess, American l gazing and hand wringing at it's worst. Nothing to do with Watchmen, either the comic or film, so call it something else. Such a let down. Go watch "The boys" and see how good this could of been in better hands. After watching the first three episodes I'm sure this will be one of the most brilliant stories told in a series. Most of what I have seen so far is still unclear and inconclusive. What is really great! It makes you think on where things will go in the next episodes. Charters are still being introduced and the information you receive only opens up more questions then it gives answers.<br/><br/>Besides it touches on the original storyline from the graphic Nobel with multiple links and Easter eggs in it. The political situation in the series can be somewhat compared to how things are developing in the real world. So while being very entertaining there is also a deeper message being shared.<br/><br/>An absolute must watch! After watching the finale, I was so proud of myself for finding time to watch this incredible series. Watchmen is a masterpiece. Every episode is unique and brave and always impress us. Comic book adapted series is getting better and better. Netflix's Umbrella Academy was a brave series and a good one. Amazon's The Boys was even braver and a very good series. HBO's Watchmen is the most ambitious and is masterclass. The direction, screenplay and every single department is pure art. Regina King gave us an outstanding performance with other very good cast. Watchmen is one of the few series which had a real impact on me and is simply one of the best series I have ever seen. Hats off Damen Lindelof. Had to leave a review because all of these ppl who don't seem to get the idea of a continuation. It's a really great series, don't listen to all those short sighted ppl. Like the title suggest I'm not rating this 10/10, it would sooner give it like an 8 but I want the rating of this show to go up because it's RIDICULOUS how low this show gets rated. This show in the first three episodes has already showed some good acting, fantastic cinematography, a good and mysterious plot, good music and reference to the original Watchmen story. Honestly people calling this bad because it touches on race problems is ridiculous, further more if you think it's too 'political' you obviously haven't even read the comic. Honestly if you don't like the show it's fine, but some of the reasons I've seen for the dislike of this show are really dumb. Quite a good start but quickly dropped in quality and turned into a filler show where nothing really happens and only the last 5 minutes give you a cliffhanger. Watch the movie instead of this garbage. 1 out of 10 stars because I can't give a lower score. Damon Lindelof thinks is Ozymandias but with this series he has proven to be just an egomaniac unable to remake Watchmen. It is insulting not mentioning Alan Moore the creator of Watchmen in the credits, not even as Watchmen creator. Alan Moore didn't want to get involved in this pastiche so shame on you Dave Gibbons.<br/><br/>Mid series it seems more like a Lost episode and that is what this series is, a bland too simplistic adaptation of a masterpiece that changed the comic world forever.<br/><br/>Doctor Manhattan history is just bad, the melodramatic music in the romantic moments among them is just silly.<br/><br/>The end is running to stand still, all this mess for nothing, just making again the same as in the comic but badly and silly as all the tones and meanings of the comic are lost.<br/><br/>Don't loose time with this series and watch the comic. Its the dumbest show ever
the idea is repeated with a weak act One of must see of the year, no matter your relationship with the comic, the movie or even superheroes in general. This is such a good show.. Its not a rehash of the same old story that some of the people on here giving 1 star reviews wanted. What it is, is a great continuation of the original great story.. Great intrigue, drama and acting Of course there are trolls that will whine and whine and whine about some agenda being pushed. The graphic novel taught us that real superheroes, like real people, are whole and flawed which went against any superhero trope at the time. Politics were a very big part of Watchmen, and always has been; Dr. Manhattan won the Vietnam war for God's sake. To express that HBO's continuation of the story is somehow pushing new ideas and goes against the graphic novel is just untrue. In fact, if anything, it shows just how easily history repeats itself as the years of Nixon have many parallels to our current political environment. Watchmen shows the dirty and despicable parts of human beings with power and what an icon for a movement can do to the country and world. The writing is very good and I enjoy the occasional homage to the novel and to the movie. The show is certainly the best parts of my Sundays now. Don't let the haters ruin this for you! Great tv show, acting and plot. If you want to see the graphic novel on screen don't watch it, go read the graphic novel man. I applaude the writers for not making just an adaptation and creating something new. This is a continuing of the COMIC, not the movie. A lot of reviewers here and on RT don't understand that the two are very different and as a result, they lost the plot before it got a chance to pick up.To get the most out of this show, do your best to forget everything from the Zack Snyder abomination and at least read the Wiki entry on Alan Moore's Watchman instead; the plot will make much more sense. The worst thing about Snyder's Watchmen was that it totally misunderstood both it's source material and Alan Moore, but thankfully, Watchmen 2019 avoids Snyder's sins by delivering something comic fans, music fans (soundtrack by Trent Reznor!) and new audiences can enjoy in equal measure. So lost, so troubled. Family focused, always worked hard, tithed at church, inner city children's ministry with wife. Treated all people the same. All gone now, all better now. Am white, and white bad. Only truth in universe. White evil, oppressive, angry, deserve to die. No middle ground. No quarter. All white bad until all white gone. Damon gave show with good truth about white evil. Now eyes open. Now see no future for America unless all white gone. No more family, no more hard work, no more church. Only want good shows now. Only need good truths now. One day, only good shows allowed. Then no one lost, no one troubled. Thank you, Damon! All better. Combining the legacy of a real historical massacre with an cleverly crafted expansion of the Watchmen universe timeline, this series hits the beat of every important issue of today and mixes it up with mind blowing science fiction. Regina King is captivating against a strong ensemble cast- including Jeremy Irons in full on supervillain camp and Hong Chau as the ice cold Lady Trieu - bring on season 2! Forget the graphic novel forget that it is Watchmen (although it unapologetically is!), this is beautiful art and television. Daring, new and adventurous tackling topics head on like we have not seen in a long time.
Moreover, the skill in writing, directing and acting is phenomenal ! We have not seen good television like this in a very long time. This show takes watchmen to a whole other level. Picks up where watchmen left off. The show could go in some many different ways. Most of the critical/bad reviews give very clear arguments on why the show is not good, so much so that I don't even need to repeat it. If you were a fan of the original Watchmen, there is a pretty good chance that you won't like this series. The original is incredibly pessimistic and paints humanity as inherently bad and doomed. The most central character is an antihero who seems to hate humanity and fight for it. The only villain in the original is actually a hero who uses the evil of humanity against itself to save us from ourselves. The original never points at any ideology, instead, it simply views the human condition.<br/><br/>By changing the setting to race-based issues, the entire concept falls apart. That's ideology instead of the human condition (unless they want to argue that we're all just destined to be racist). The show could have been its own. The fact that it is set in the same universe as Watchmen is both perplexing and absolutely deserving of backlash.<br/><br/>I do give it three stars, however, because the actual production is great. The only people who deserve to be criticized are the writers and the HBO executives who believed this story could live up to the expectations set by its title. How does this guy keep geting work? What does he have over tv show producers that compels them to hire Lindelof? He lacks the talent to deliver coherent quality scripts and only has a proven history of failures. This could have been a great rival to Amazon's The Boys, but it's just another Lindelof catastrophe where he imitates other (better) scriptwriters and their ideas, and we all die a little inside. Sorry, for ppl who like the show, but you must understand that not everyone have the same taste and I coulnd't see more then 15min. of 1st. episode. I did not read the comic book but a show must MAKE you want to see it. I didn't. So really, we have the right of having another opinion. and I didn't like the spin off of the others episodes eather. So that is my rate and period. That should be the title.
Regina King is the lead and frankly a horrible choice for A main character of a major HBO series.
I just don't care for her or anything about her character.
I was a huge fan of the movie and graphic novels.
This is not the watchmen you know and love, don't waste your time. Cringefest all the way! Was so excited that this was being made.... sadly the final product is horrible. Turning the BEST figure from Watchmen.... Rorchak... into a White Supremicist figure was non-sensical! I will end with this.... where are the Watchmen? Oh thats right.... not in this series! It's difficult to get rid of the "whokeness" stench. Still hard pass. The Stage is set for a hate on all white people, why the need to portrait white people to be the bad ones. Good grief, some of these trolls. They complained about Danaerys (Game of Thrones). They complained about Maeve, Dolores, Bernard and Charlotte (Westworld). In fact they whine and complain any time a WHITE MALE is not the most significant, most powerful or most dominant character in a film or tv series. For these guys if anyone other than a CIS white male is in the hero role or has significant agency, their tender sensibilities are crushed. This speaks to the level of entitlement and privilege these whiners have enjoyed for decades. It's pathetic.<br/><br/>If you don't have a "John Wayne" complex and that sense of entitlement, then you might enjoy this series. The story is top-notch and well conceived. The single season series wraps up nicely with not just answers to your questions but they're highly imaginative and with a nice twist. It does however leave itself open to the possibility of additional seasons with the right ideas. I really enjoyed HBOs Watchmen. Check it out! The alt-right people who roams this page this days are so full of themself and so blinded by his faith, that they thought that Watchmen comics are apollitical, or even conservative. Is a new breed of stupid. Great series so far even if is not as good or has not much to do with the original Too many tough talking,spitting women, a flabby young cop & a Grandma dominate all comers..overkill, unrealistic.
Didn't make it past episode 3. Wasn't horrible. Had some good elements but honestly you could see it coming a mile away. Was hoping for so much better. Good acting redeemed it a lot but still. So so I wish I could give a rating of 0/10 for this pretentious, unwatchable travesty. Full disclosure - I'm not familiar with the comic, and I was not a fan of the movie. BUT I'm thoroughly enjoying this show so far. It's a bit out there and you definitely need to go into it with an open mind, but IMO that's what makes it entertaining. It might not be for the hardcore comic/movie fans (I wouldn't know) but as for the conservative snowflakes throwing a fit about an "agenda" y'all should maybe just relax & stick to Fox News and reruns of Last Man Standing. This is such peak 2019 faux social justice bull.<br/><br/>It's clearly been designed to appeal to liberals who want their worldview parroted back to them. And yet, the show still revels in the destruction of black bodies. All the worst violence in the show is visited upon black people; they're lynched, shot in the head, shot in the chest, dragged behind cars in the street, die slowly, piled across the ground. It seems the only way Hollywood knows how to lift black people up is to constantly repeat the trauma they've endured for dramatic effect. There were many moments in the first episode when they could have showed violence against whites instead, which would have fit with the plot, since most of the whites in the show are 'white supremacists,' but instead the camera pans away, doing the equivalent of a boot scene for violence (a 7K member is tortured in police custody, and all we see is some blood trickle from under the bottom of a closed door).<br/><br/>And while we're talking about the show's abysmally confused politics, which is just about all the substance the show can come up with, they have a black woman blatantly playing an Asian character. This woman is supposedly born in Saigon, has on an Asian get up, and is introduced to the audience over stereotypical Asian zither music. She's clearly not Asian, just an Asian-looking black woman.<br/><br/>Hollywood, if you're gonna try to be progressive about race, don't also traffic blatantly in racial stereotypes at the same time.<br/><br/>I don't even mind racial stereotypes. I'm Asian, I enjoyed The Hangover, idgaf. No, it's the fact that this show is clearly just cashing in on the zeitgeist and trying to appeal to a woke audience, while still pretty blatantly exploiting stereotypes at the same time. It's opportunist, cynical, greedy, and a prime example of how Hollywood doesn't actually give a **** about any of these issues and only wants to monetize them.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the show outside of the its politics... nope, there really isn't anything else to discuss. The show expends so much energy on race-play that there's hardly any time left to develop a real story. Production is pretty neat tho. What a lot of crap and pseudo politically correct bias. This is not Watchmen. 4 episodes in and this show is going nowhere. It is extremely bland and has almost zero potential to get better. The characters are dull and there is absolutly no story. It flounders at every turn. I hope HBO drops this show and puts more effort into other series. This is a fantastic show. Do not listen to whiny complaints about this being too "bad." It's relevant to American politics, if your viewpoint is so fragile it can't stand some pushback then yeah maybe this show isn't for you. If you live outside of a tiny bubble, you'll love this show! It is funny that Mandalorian got 8 and watchmen got 7. 
This show has it all; the thrill, the well written realistic plot, the production, the innovation. It never stop amusing. The thrill , mentality, and suspense like the True detective is here. The grandular war between insurgency and police is made believable, even more amazing, refreshed in a parallel universe . The action is smart and efficiency like Nolan film. The best thing is there is always wow factor for pot head to amuse.<br/><br/>Getting 7.4 is heart breaking, it deserve 9. like those top shows. Watchmen is an 80s graphic novel that channeled the social political climate era of it's time.It also had a mature take on superheroes , acknowledging the fact that some of them were psychologically broken.It was more than escapist fare and this show understands that more than any other adaptation of Watchmen. And I really don't care. Very confusing and little or no storyline. Pointless rubbish. I never read the story, so I really have no care about anything it's supposed to be telling me. The negative reviews are laughable, the grammar is terrible which always indicates the level of intelligence. Complaining about character development after 5 mins of a show is ridiculous, character development in a series takes time. This world just exists in the same reality as the original film, that is all no other relevance as I see it. Oh and Don Johnson looks amazing for 70 odd. A disgusting piece. Enough of this please. Just make a TV series that isn't trying to tell me how to think. What does this have yo do with Watchmen? The music was so off and weird. TRAP music? Really?<br/><br/>I was turned off by the opening scene. I' am so sick and tired of the same old "racism" injected into so many films today. It has ZERO place in Watchmen.<br/><br/>
Same thing happened to Star Trek and Star Wars. A few people that had no clue how to make films and worse, not connect them to the original films. Like others have said, what was the point of this? The original Watchmen had a purpose. Do we kill a million people to save a billion? This was just nonsense. It was so far off the mark... was this a Spike Lee film? Just bad, really bad.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the acting was horrible. If you read the books you would know how political the Watchmen series is. Anyone saying this is bad because of politics is either to thin skinned to have anything enter their brain they don't agree with and or haven't read the actual books. If you had read the books you would have known what you were getting yourself into.<br/><br/>A lot of the storyline is from "The Button;"
And "Doomsday Clock series" also a little bit of "before Watchmen" sprinkled in.<br/><br/>The Watchmen is a Political Satire Graphic Novel. Either grow a thicker skin or continue to only watch media that agrees with your bias. Good show, interesting, of course in not the original watchmen bur is refreshing This show is not for those with a low IQ. It's an intellectuals show. Racists will hate it, bigots will despise it. As for me, I think it's phenomenal on every level. The writing is spot on and then depth is magnificent. The use of colors and cinematography is stellar. I just wish I could binge it!! Along with WARRIOR (Cinemax) this is my new favorite show. Interesting and different history than the last movie! It is good if you like violence and science. A great story with a weak ending. I don't know if it's me, but I found too many holes on the script. The explanation of why Dr. Manhattan looks different... stupid. And humanize him like that??? Suddenly he just felt in love with Angela, and change all his nature, for her??? I don't know, there are many facts wrong there, or weird at least. Also the end is weak, but furthermore the execution, production, storytelling, is at the very least amazing, how it all gets connected is smart, nice, really great. Warning: This is a bit long and does contain spoilers, but these things need to be said.<br/><br/>Watchmen started off rather strong, but like so many properties utilizing established franchises, these days it simply couldn't hold onto it that very long before devolving into the destruction of established characters or turning them into caricatures of themselves as a way of "handing off" the franchise to its new ones while starting to get its audience to like these new characters before making us come to almost resent their existence and replacement of the old in the end.<br/><br/>When the show starts, it is indeed an interesting look at how life in the Watchmen Universe has progressed since the epic climax that occurred in the comic. That's one thing people who watch this show need to understand first thing. This series is not a continuation of Snyder's film, but a continuation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. As such, there are plot points that won't make sense if you are unaware of what occurred in the comic, such as the big climax involving an extra-dimensional squid appearing in New York. While we don't really see how the world at large has moved on outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma and Vietnam, we do get at least some sense of it and how superheroes have become outlawed to a degree there is even a specialized unit in the FBI to deal with them exclusively. At the same time, we see how their existence has influenced modern culture and practices, such as how the Tulsa police department has adopted the practice of having all of their officers wear masks and keeping their identities secret, essentially turning them all into masked superheroes. It's an interesting concept, but along with what seems like a policy that they are not allowed to carry lethal firearms without special, on-site situational authorization, it is quickly abandoned and forgotten about with the existence of the latter not even being explained.<br/><br/>One infuriating thing the series does, which seems to be symptomatic when it comes to Hollywood these days, is to really play the racism card. One major plot-point of the series is an organization of racists are some of the antagonists. While this in and of itself is not a bad thing, it really felt like the writers wanted to simply inject racism into the show and, once again, point out what every rational person should already be quite knowledgeable about: racism is bad. I appreciate that such ideals are still very much alive and well in modern times, but it feels like wasted screen time when it didn't even seem like racism was a very widespread issue in the current Watchmen timeline. At least, there's nothing outside of this specific story that indicated racism was a problem in America. That and the writers clearly couldn't resist the siren call of race-flipping a major character in the series that has become almost parasitic in Hollywood these days. More on that later.<br/><br/>With the old, established characters, the series did what so many bad, modern Hollywood properties with established franchises have done, they turned the "old guard" into caricatures of themselves to make the "new blood" look better. Rorschach was used as a symbol of racists when nothing in his character lent itself to something like that whatsoever. There is no explanation of why the antagonist group used his mask and his journal, something that might have added some serious weight and depth to the lore of his character, was given literally only a passing glance. Silk Spectre, had the potential to be an interesting character, having moved on from the superhero life to become a hardened FBI agent who went after costumed superheroes. They showed her to be smart and capable, and yet because they needed a climax they made this battle hardened warrior incredibly stupid. We are meant to believe that when an antagonist tries to engage a trap for her, openly, and the trap actually fails twice before engaging, this woman doesn't seem to possess any kind of danger or combat instincts whatsoever when we've seen plenty of evidence to contrary both in this series and the comic that came before it. They turned her into a "damsel in distress" simply because they needed the new protagonists to save her. It was, frankly, quite insulting. Owlman is not even utilized in the series, nor is there any indication what happened to him (possibly so they could use him in the next series) beyond using his ship design for the police. Dr. Manhattan... well, that part was particularly mixed.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan is brought back, and in something of an interesting way, but ultimately his use was very transparent. His initial introduction was well done, showcasing not his awesome combative powers, but in how he perceives time differently from humans in that he experiences every moment in his timeline simultaneously. This allows for the concept of a paradox done in an interesting and believable way, yet unfortunately at the same time it amounts to it essentially being fate in that it cannot be changed. It almost seemed like the character had absolutely no concept of self-preservation whatsoever and simply allowed future events to take place without even making an attempt at altering them for no reason such as the events of time cannot be changed because of "science-babble". Also, this is where Hollywood couldn't resist the whole race-flipping issue. While the audience is never allowed to see Dr. Manhattan's face during his introduction, because of a rather convoluted plot that had him turning himself human to be with our lead character, when he returns to his regular form his features are still that of the person he had been pretending to be for the previous ten years... that of a black man. There is no explanation for this and it really felt like Hollywood wanted to make the character black (in feature, he was still blue) because that's their current trend, to make white characters black. It's also the only time we see the character's face in his true form, which almost had the feeling like the writers didn't ever want the audience to identify Dr. Manhattan as ever having the facial features of a white man, once again pushing the whole racial concept that permeated the series.<br/><br/>As for Ozymandias, he also was turned into something of a caricature. While Jeremy Irons did well with the character, and he did show a fair bit of his genius-level intellect, his physicality that was also a core part of his character was completely lost outside of a tiny, throwaway scene. However, they turned him into a kind of mad scientist that did somewhat fit with the scenario he was in, but at the same time it felt like a fairly strong departure for the character. Once again, taking down the old character to make the new ones look so much better.<br/><br/>Of the new characters, some where interesting, but again Hollywood squandered this. The lead character of Angela started off interesting, leading essentially a double life as a cop, but she quickly became a surrogate for the audience in a way that detracted from the character rather than adding to it. The best I can use to describe her is meh with some interesting points. I will say they didn't go over the top with the whole "strong, independent woman" thing which is a point in the writers' favor. The character of Looking Glass, now that's where I felt the writing really failed. This character had the potential to be a kind of surrogate successor to Rorschach and it was utterly squandered. His hillbilly-like twang worked very well to highlight an incredibly keen mind as a police investigator and interrogator and it seemed like they modeled his mask to be somewhat like Rorschach's as well. Unfortunately, this was squandered halfway through the show when he started making incredibly stupid choices just for the express purpose of moving the plot forward and in the end resulted in him being little more than a side character.<br/><br/>There were other characters on the police force that felt like they should have had more done with them, namely the other two detectives that had their own superhero-like masks and costumes, but literally nothing was done with them other than giving one a Russian accent. It felt like a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>That waste, coincidentally, came in the form of the last four or five episodes of the series. Essentially, the second half of this series was literally nothing but one, big backstory exposition dump. An entire episode was dedicated to Hooded Justice, which again Hollywood race-flipped by retconning it so that he was a black man so it could directly tie in to the main character Angela/Sister Night. Oh, and he was also apparently gay, with absolutely no explanation for this considering he was married with a wife and the two had a son. Literally there is no explanation for this. He gets recruited by Captain Metropolis into the Minutemen and suddenly they're having sex. There's no buildup, absolutely no indication whatsoever that he might be interested in men sexually, nothing. It's a blatant attempt to re-write Watchmen lore so the character could be black and have a modern day legacy. Honestly, this felt like such wasted opportunity and screen time that could have been used for further character development and not make it feel so ham-handed.<br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen did what so many DC superhero movies and shows have done as of late, utterly squandered their properties. It started off strong, with interesting ideas and characters, and quickly devolved into what has become modern Hollywood tropes that are treading dangerously close to SJW territory. This show is great. It has top notch acting (Regina King, Jeremy Irons, all the others), world class cinematography (love the way they switch scenes), a kick-ass soundtrack, and a really wild ride of a plot.<br/><br/>How some people can not like this is beyond me. I mean, it's one of those shows that demands that you stretch your imagination a bit. And some people don't like that and that's ok. But to say it's boring or bad acting, that I just don't get at all. But to say this show is too political. Those people are completely missing the point. It's the best show I've seen in a long time. I loathed this series after the first episode or two...mainly because I'm a HUGE fan of the Watchmen, and I felt like the series was a huge step down from the motion picture adaption (and that adaption wasn't great, so you get an idea of how much I disliked this in the beginning)...as the season went on it seemed like the actors became more comfortable and it showed. They really began to grow into their roles. After the second episode on, the overall quality of the show improves....DRASTICALLY. If you gave up after the first episode or two, I recommend going back and watching the rest because the rest of the series in comparison with the beginning is like night and day. I was pleasantly surprised and my opinion of the series as a whole improved tremendously. I guess maybe it was just some growing pains with the beginning of the season? I don't know....but this actually ended up being a GREAT series, albeit with a very mediocre beginning. Before you watch this you should probably know that this show is a sequel to the comic. This is an incredible show that keeps you guessing and theorizing long after each episode. Definitely recommended If you love the comic book and you are looking for a new story in the world of the Watchmen, you will love this show. On the other hand if you are looking for a new comic book adaptation, or movie reboot, this is not for you.<br/><br/>I'm all ready 4 episodes in, and it's clear to say this is the best show of 2019. It has the tone of the comic book and leaves you with the suspension that something sinister is about to happen.<br/><br/>If you never read the comic book, I would recommend you do so before watching. As you not fully appreciate the world building of the show.<br/><br/>This show is a must watch, especially if you like the Leftovers. I've never read the comic or seen the movie. However, I am a comic book guy and was looking forward to a story with new characters not set in a Marvel or DC universe.
 It seems like writers recently are all too willing to jump on the bandwagon, thankful that they don't have to come up with something original.<br/><br/>And where were the super-heroes? I only saw one episode, but I couldn't tell if anyone was enhanced in any way. Maybe the silver masked guy or the other guy in a red mask. But I haven't any idea what their powers are.<br/><br/>Lastly, at times it felt like I was watching This Is Us. A show I've never seen but can hear when my wife watches it. This just isn't for me. It's not something I want to see for the umpteenth time and really, I would like some escapism. Not a reminder of how things are/can be in real life. I can see how many people would like this show and probably have been waiting for it for a long time. That's fine, I'll pass.<br/><br/>I gave it 5 stars, because I can't say if it's good or bad. Just not my cup of tea and really, nothing in it for me. Seems to have a decent cast, of well known faces. But they are wasted on a boring plot.<br/><br/>I kept hoping by episode two, there would be something to keep me coming back...if this is one of those long drawn out slow starts, it better be worth the wait. For now I will pass. When I saw all the proud boy internet trolls receiving their marching orders to bash a series after a single episode, I knew this show would be worth checking out. It's certainly different from the original source material, but after a single episode (and the previews of later episodes) it does show promise and I think it will veer back towards the original comic ideas.<br/><br/>It's certainly much better than the 1-star reviews given by people who certainly didn't watch the episode, and most likely got their marching orders from others who are threatened by seeing anything than a white-washed version of their "beloved" (misunderstood) comic, most of which probably went over their empty hollow heads. Anytime that many trolls roll out to attack something, it's got to show some promise. I've just watched the pilot and I personally found it really enjoyable, it is set in a really interesting alternative world/future. We only just start to get a feel for the lead characters in the pilot but there is certainly enough for me to look forward to the next episode as it ended on a real cliffhanger.
I really don't understand the one out of ten reviews at all, the acting was good and it has obviously been given a healthy budget as the sets and effects are really good. As always,reviews being highjacked by people who use meaningless buzzwords. Ignore them. It is a decent show Nauseating pc crap. Ignore the robot 10:scores, this is multicultural crap Dr Manhattan is a potential solar system, whole galaxies destroyer... a bonafide world ender. Logically and realistically, there should be multiple resistant groups and governments trying to end him before(first); like Ozymandias with his plan B; and there would be also many others cults emerging and worshiping him to bring Armageddon on Earth(The Leftovers style); i understand the real and very dark History of Tulsa, but the Cavalry cult make little to no sense in this story. If the reviewers here could put aside their politics and just watch the show, they'd find that it is a gripping, well-acted piece of television. The CGI and environments are great, and the choices of music are fun. As someone who never read the graphic novel or have seen the movie, I was a bit confused by a few of the events in the first episode, but I liked it enough to keep watching, and I'll probably end up reading the novel. Put aside your politics, watch it for what it is, a TV show. As a fan of the original maxi series comic, I can't put into words how disappointed I am with this. A waste of a good cast, especially Regina King and Jean Smart. The writers missed the point that the politics in the comic were subtle, not written by SJW, beating an audience over the head with their messages. I'm not wasting any more time watching this because it's unengrossing, slow and just throwing in a few names from the great graphic novel, doesn't place it firmly in the Watchmen universe. How watching this makes you a better person and species:<br/><br/>1. You'll learn racism is bad
It's so weird- it condemns white racism, but not police violence or anything else portrayed, as if that's the only standard you have to meet to be a good person. It also shows all white racists as mustache-twirling villains, with no nuance or anything.<br/><br/>2. You'll learn modern politics with zero context
Hate gun control? Racist. Against reparations? Racist. Why? Cuz they said so.
The writers couldn't actually make cases for their positions because they had no idea what they were advocating. So they masked their ignorance in poorly-written satire. I really felt pity for them.<br/><br/>3. You'll watch something unrelated to the actual title
The book gets referenced, but the spirit of it is long-gone. Characters from the book all show up, but the show's not about them or the world of the book they came from. The book's tone is completely gone and replaced with hope, which might be fine if it wasn't inside a world of moral relativism.
They say a certain all-powerful person could've done more for humanity, but why should he have? Why is it his place to force the world to be better?
They did make some interesting twists on the main 4 returning characters, but by the end most of them were so twisted they were unlike the characters in the book (which means Zack Snyder's movie is more character-accurate than HBO's "sequel"). The title needs to change, it's very misleading.<br/><br/>4. You get half-good stories and characters
Weirdly enough, episodes 1 and 9 were bad while most of episodes 2-8 were decent.
The old man subplot is slow and goes nowhere.
The Looking-Glass episode is decent.
The Hooded Justice episode is decent, but arguably changes the character.
Same for the Dr. Manhattan episode.
The Silk Spectre episode is okay until she forces laughter. Her story sucked too.
Regina King, the main character, sucks. Her and the entire police force are fascists and they're never challenged on it. She also makes a lot of stupid choices.
The overarching mysteries presented are too long for you to care about by the end.
The rich Vietnamese woman turns out to be incredibly boring, and not at all close to compelling as Ozymandias was in the book.
And everyone is stoic ALL the time. There's no one that enters a scene and brings actual tension with them. Even the action...is kinda just ok.<br/><br/>5. You'll get so many good ideas that become missed opportunities
Pieces of squid raining from the sky sometimes? Nice.
Police being fascists dressed as superheroes? Great. Totally could be used to something profound about American police today.
Government always lying? Of course.
But all these ideas... go wasted.<br/><br/>Don't Watch, Man.
Instead, I'd recommend just reading the book again. It actually asked questions on the role of heroes and utilitarianism. That's all I wanted to do after watching this. That, and a long shower. "! Sorry, your review is too short."
IMDB because it was Simply brilliant... Any show that makes the right freak out about politics and crying people are evil socialists (lol really?) is great in my book. nobody cares about your obvious horrible "politics." I'd call it hatred.. Review the show, and find somewhere else to hang out and troll. No wonder they had to take forums down, idiots lol<br/><br/>Greaaaat show btw;) #WatchmenHBO is next level storytelling. It's amazing how these 9 episodes captured pain, tragedy, trauma, racism, privilege, power, influence, love, sacrifice moral dilemmas, context, and perspective. Add some wonderfully written humor and dark humor, too. In the late 1980s, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons dropped a bombshell on the comic world with Watchmen. Set in an alternative 1985 in a world where 'costumed adventures' are the norm and nuclear war loomed, it was, in the words of the BBC's Nicholas Barber, "the moment comics grew up." It's since spawned Zach Snyder's too faithful for its own good film adaptation, and now an HBO limited series from writer Damon Lindelof. Set 34 years after the comic, the series acts as one part sequel and one part 21st-century remix of the original.<br/><br/>And this is most assuredly a sequel to the Moore-Gibbons comic, not the Snyder film. If you weren't a fan of the movie (and the change made to the ending after being faithful to the comic), there's no need to fret. Moments such as a scene in episode one and the epic effects shot early in part five make clear in whose path we're treading. All of which should make fans of the original very happy, indeed. Though that isn't to say that this series is covering the same old territory, of course.<br/><br/>In a piece over on The Mary Sue last autumn, Jessica Mason explored the "fanfic" element of the series. And, after seeing it, I'm forced to conclude that she very much has a point. The series does focus on new characters plus some returning ones from the comic. We meet the children of some of the characters and meet a couple who were only a reference in the original comic. All of which happens while telling a story that is, on its most fundamental level, a sequel to the comic. Is that a bad thing?<br/><br/>Not in the slightest, as Mason concluded in her piece. For all that this is a sequel, Lindelof and his writers are very much charting a course all their own. This Watchmen takes place, not in urban squalor, but in the American heartland in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It's a story about legacy in which almost everyone we meet is dealing with their own in some size, shape, or form. The setting is perfect for exploring that theme as the series opens with a visceral recreation of the city's devastating (and to large extent hushed up) 1921 race riot. As the comic dealt with the Reagan era, the series deals with things very much in the here and now. Be it a resurgent far-right or police brutality. Or our perception of the past versus its realities and the dangers of Nostalgia (literally in the case of that one). It's this forging of a new path that makes the series as compelling and fascinating as it is.<br/><br/>Though it doesn't hurt that it is superbly brought to life as well. The cast alone makes the series worth checking out. There's the notional heroes, those police officers who wear masks, such as Regina King's Angela Abar and Tim Blake Nelson's Wade Tillman, flawed but compelling 'costumed adventurers.' As returning characters from the comic are Jean Smart and Jeremy Irons, both offering strong performances exploring who those people became in the three decades since we last saw them.<br/><br/>There are Louis Gossett Jr. and Hong Chau as a pair of characters whose origins and actions add to the depth of the piece plus, especially in the case of Chau, offering an unsettling air as well. There's Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Angela's husband Cal and Don Johnson as Tulsa police chief Judd Crawford, both playing men with central roles in Angela's life in very different ways. Even smaller parts are well cast from James Wolk's Senator and Frances Fisher as Crawford's wife to Jovan Adepo as the younger version of Gossett's character who gets an extraordinary hour of television all to himself. It's a cast to die for and one which populates the nine episodes to superb effect.<br/><br/>The series is just as strong as a production. Across nine episodes, five cinematographers, and six directors, the show retains the feeling of it being all of one piece (with the notable exception of episode six which is deliberately something very different, indeed) giving it a visual, as well as a narrative, gel that suits it well. The work of the production design and costume departments goes a long well to sell this alternative world. It's just enough different to our world while also taking cues from the original comic. The effects work, both practical and CGI, helps with that as well, especially for moments such as the aforementioned shot early in episode five and heading into the finale. Add on a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (along with select choices of source music) and you have a slick, dare I say cinematic, production.<br/><br/>HBO's Watchmen stands as a triumph. As a sequel, it's done with much affection and understanding for its source material. In fact, it is a better screen version of Watchmen that the film version in large part because it not only has more space to tell its story but also because it uses the original to tell its own story. In terms of production, it brings a strong cast and cinematic production values together to tell its story, creating a compelling work in the process. In short, it's everything that makes good TV good TV.<br/><br/>"Who watches the Watchmen?" Why you should be. Grasping on to the original idea of a world full of heroes and villains in which anything can and will happen. Don't give in to the negative reviews because HBO has delivered another hit show. That will leave you constantly questioning and trying to predict what will happen next. It's like some people are still angry with Game Of Thrones ending and they're taking it out on HBO's Watchmen.
Just watch the show, it's really amazing. Let me just start this by saying that you should not listen to anyone out there and give this show a chance. This show is one of the most heart wrenching shows out there that beautifully interlinks so much together all in the universe of the watchmen. From the brilliant acting to the wonderful cinematography and to of course the perfect story, watchmen is a show made for the current era. And while being complicated, you should give this a watch because it is unlike anything out there currently on tv. You are truly missing out by not watching. I will say it does take time, but once you watch the first 2-3 episodes, you will understand what I meant earlier by saying what a show this is. (Just be warned, you should know the basic premise of the original watchmen comic to really understand the show, but luckily there are plenty summaries that take 3-5 minutes that you can read on the internet). Great characters, great actors, a beatiful photograpy, a pretty good soundtrack, and yet, an incredible boring series. Ok so first of all let me state that I am neither a huge fan of the movie nor did I think it is a bad movie. All in all pretty decent but in my humble opinion nothing extraordinary.<br/><br/>So when I heard that there is a TV show based on the movie/the comics I was relatively humble in my expectations, especially when I saw that the imdb score was below what I would usually even consider watching.<br/><br/>But boy oh boy this show is actually quit enjoyable. I have watched the 1st 3 episodes and I am really hooked. I like unconventional style in which the "heroes" are portrayed and on how everything comes together piece by piece.<br/><br/>My advice: Don't let the review scores scare you away and give this show a shot. Saw first episode and waited to see the second and now i want to say this is some masked mumbojumbo. I cant believe how 2 hours can pass and no real dialog took place. people make jokes, stumble with words, are ironic, sharp minded sometimes. this show is nothing of that sort. its dialog is synthetic as a tent s roof. it fallows strict the action and brings nothing new and no enterteinment along side. no brain was put to work. all is set on low and low enterteinment it is. also, flashbacks are horrible. horrible. masks? cmon... im not watching this. So far off to a good start, I want to see more and where the story will go, please disregard the hate reviews, the show is being trolled by some waste, give it a try and stop posting hate messages Won't we? I think it's funny to see reviews here, saying "woke this" and "leftie that", with watching the first(!) episode, and without having a real context, without havin' seen the whole season. Me personally, after seein' the first episode, I remain critical/sceptical, there's lots interesting stuff I would like to know more about, but there is also some stuff I don't agree with and I'm curious to see where it all goes, to build an opinion. So far, it's ok, but still nowhere near the genius that was the novel, imo the movie's crap! (for now) 5/10 After watching the pilot, I trust the story will unfold in an interesting way. Great quality, love Regina King and Jeremy Irons. A good mix of violence, tragedy and comedy. Good grief, not another comic strip/graphic novel based production. I am sick and tired of this proliferation of all these superhero/vigilante/saviors from the apocalypse movies. They used to invade the theaters and TV programming during the summer break, now they're everywhere all the time. It's the infantilization of America. All this talent and effort just to spice up an adolescent fantasy story, give it a grown up shine and shove it down the adults' throat. Grow up, people. Created an account just so I could show some love for this show, first one out the gate was great chapter 1 point. Awesome selection on the cast. Fantastic setting, style editing. Just everything, HBO has done justice to the comic, the ending of the film can be forgotten in the case of the show. The first 2 scenes had me hooked and I had a blast along the way. Leave your political ideals or preconceived notions about the comic book, graphic novels, and the movie out of the equation. It's set in the same universe and has strange scenes at times, but their meaning is cleverly explain later in the show. Sadly only 9 ( or 10, maybe?) episodes. Leave your political views or quit being such a fan boy that you won't watch it to episode 4 at least and not be so intrigued that you won't binge it. Totally worth it. The dude (Lindelof) wrote the HBO show 'The Leftovers' which was amazing. I'd give Watchmen a 7.89 all day and I am a harsh film critic. Hopefully season 2 will be even better. I really didn't know what to expect with this series. Watchmen is such a polarizing story, especially with the Snyder movie and it's comparison to the source materia, but wow Damon Lindelof and company have done an amazing job with this show. I read a comment about this being a "slow burn," it truly is. The've weaved in story elements from the original story into this new story and hit you with twists and turns that make you ask.....what? how? that is amazing! This is TV at it's finest. This is one of the few shows that stop me from picking up my phone while watching, every scene is so beautifully shot and the story is captivating. A truly masterful show that apparently has hurt a certain group of white men who are afraid of giving up even the tiniest bit of screenspace. (This show absolutely don't warrant a single one star review, but here we are) Highly recommend everyone else who loves art to give it a watch! Once it establishes all the backstory it really gets good. I've never read the comics, but enjoyed the movie. This takes place after the events in the movie, the only difference is the show (and comic) has a giant squid instead of a huge explosion like in the movie. The flashback scenes really grab your attention. Check out the show, you'll like it. Lindelof is proving he has a deep knowledge and respect for the source material and this is a must see show. The detractors of this show are mouth breaking troglodytes who can't see past their political biases. Give it a chance, you won't be disjointed. Many people waited in inticipation for this series to be aired, thinking it would mimic that of the movie that it shares its title. Unfortunately after watching the 1st episode, many of them would have been disappointed in what they had just watched. Many may not have even gone on to watch episode 2. Well how silly are they?. With each episode the story just gets better and better. By half way through, all those people that stopped watching after episode 1, will never know what an awesome series they've missed out on. As the story unfolds, the viewers begin to see the connection it has with the movie and by the final 3 episodes, you've been given exactly what you wanted and much more. Too soon to give a note or a decent review for this TV show as there is only one episode released for now. But this first episode is good and announce a promising plot for the future. Can't wait to see what's coming next ! This show was good at world building for a while, but it failed to stay true to fundamental themes of the graphic novel. Let's take a look at the elephant in the room, Dr. Manhattan. He was a character who seemed to lose all sense of development he had gained from the comic just to become this new character that the show needed for filling plot holes. Falling in love, dying, these are things that comic book Doc evolved from. Yet in this show he is naive like a newborn baby. He didn't really fit the small scale universe that the show was building at the start where it felt like a strange crime drama. By the end, there is so much happening that you forget about how gritty and real the show felt in the first half of the season. The new characters become overshadowed with the old and they just didn't get them right. Ozymandias is simplified to an eccentric arrogant scientist instead of the calculated intellect that he was in the comic. The show seems to also forget about the burden that saving the world was to Adrian as seen in the pirate comic within the comic. Laurie Blake was the best out of the old characters for a while, but she was ultimately left with very little to do. I guess I will touch on Rorschach's impact on the world which I believe was the best executed. It makes perfect sense for his journal to be used by hate groups and cults, kind of an ingenious world building.
As for the new characters, there are hits and misses. Looking Glass was a great addition to the story. He really reminded me of a lighter take on Rorschach, very paranoid and reclusive (just not as insane) His solo episode was my favorite, but after that, he disappears for half the season! This is what I mean by the story becoming too big for its own good. Sister Night was interesting enough but didn't blow me away. For her being the main character, she had very little actual character development throughout the show. They explain her backstory and her family history, but almost nothing about her as a person. I just feel like this was a missed opportunity. The other side characters were sort of one dimensional typical villains that you'd see in normal comic book movies- but I'd expect something a little deeper for Watchmen.
This show is a case of too many twists in place of good storytelling. At first I was compelled to watch further for the story and world building and to see the characters solve the mystery. However, when the mystery didn't fit the story they had been building too, I felt like I was coming back just to have my questions answered- not for a good story. I feel like if you took Doc out of the show it grounds the story a bit more and makes the reveals and twists feel more earned rather than pointless fan service. I think a better ending would have been to let the racist become a god only for him to realize that he doesn't care about any of that and then just goes off to mars. Like that's where they messed up the god part. The whole point of Doc in the comics was his detachment from world. Wouldn't the senator or Lady Truei do the same? Anyways this show had the potential for greatness but ultimately squandered it in favor of bait and switch storytelling. If you get Watchmen you kind of know it is self contained: it does not need further nor complementary narrations, nor any adaptation to other medium. Yet, they keep triying; God knows it's useless, but they'll just keep trying.<br/><br/>This series almost make me change my mind but ultimately fails as just another intent to appropriate something that should be left alone.<br/><br/>Positives: well produced, good cast and a couple of interesting new characters. The premise, that of the smartest woman's lust for power, it's kind of a good reveal. Nevertheless:<br/><br/>Negatives: anything good is a rift from the comics. Most "new" themes are derivative of the first season of Westworld and It's Hard to be a God. When all that stuff is filtered you get the only piece of originality which is politics. Yes: politics.<br/><br/>All this stuff only to have Dr. Manhattan recreated as a black man, and the themes derived from it. Not for amy reason that is consistent with the original, but it is what they think it should be.<br/><br/>It's as is some writer would be writing a sequel Moby Dick, inserted some Sartre "themes" and all to tell you how you ought think about the world.<br/><br/>Can see how this series could be interesting to those who haven't read the comic book. I'd sugest you just read that. This will be very mysterious and perhaps complex show where will be hard do distinct good and bad easly and plainly. This show is one of the best tv series ever made. Impeccable writing, acting, directing and world building. The philosophical and social commentary is so profound, raw and painful. This is a show of its times. It's meta, it's retro, it's futuristic. It keeps getting deeper and deeper and building upon the Watchmen mythos, expanding it into something universal. Multidimensional characters with different moral approaches to what justice, revenge, love and survival mean. Don't listen to its critics. They're just morons, Trump supporters, incels, white supremacists and scums that don't have the mental capacity to see the picture this show is painting. 2019 marks the end of a decade of incredible television. Having watched an exorbitant amount of television the pat ten years I can say without doubt Lindelof's Watchmen is some of the best, most complete work we have received.<br/><br/>I watched The Leftovers and loved it, though it sometimes left questions unanswered throughout the series. I have not seen Lost but I have friends with similar issues about that series. With Watchmen, Lindelof has mastered the art of developing mystery and suspending disbelief while also providing masterfully crafted payoffs for the audience. The plot reveals in this show are shockingly brilliant.<br/><br/>Audio and Visual work in Watchmen are stellar. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross absolutely kill the score. The camera work is spectacular. Set decoration often provides nostalgia for a time which never even truly occurred. I cannot give this crew enough love for creating an awesome universe mirroring our own.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence, I would recommend surrendering yourself to the show and giving it a try. I write this review after episode 8 and admit the second half of the season was leagues better than the first. I attribute this to world-building, introducing characters, and setting the stage for a remarkably dramatic conclusion. I can't wait for the last two episodes of the season. Have no experience with watchmen (apart from the seeing the movie many years ago) but i feel it's a shame this show has been underrated. i'm through episode 5 and it just keeps getting more interesting. the characters are great as is the acting, filming, etc. very weirdly interesting ideas. i also enjoyed the boys but this has a different flavour to it, and, maybe, seems a bit more polished. give it a shot.... Why didn't HBO just do the story from the original graphic novels? They have the rights to one of the best super hero stories ever told and they make a sequel to it set in modern day. This is a waste of time with only two good characters. The chief of police is great but he dies in the first episode. Mirror guy is easily the best character but they give all the screen time to Regina King. And why is that? Because she's a strong black woman of course. All I can say is WOW!!! Im hooked!!! Don't listen to the haters. This is an excellent show. Forget what you think you're about to see, and just watch it First of all i expented more from this series and not this "bullcrap; i watched like 3 episodes and it was terrible. Movie watchman (2009) was way better then this crap This is ground breaking, thrilling, dark and very relevant to today's America. Regina King is flawless. Ignore reviews and watch immediately. Watchmen, based Alan Moore's seminal work, is yet another example of Damon Lindelof not having any understanding of the thing he loves. Watchmen is another Lindelof mystery that makes no sense whatsoever. Though it's not the worst thing ever, the fact that it's only tangentially connected to Watchmen via pooped out references here and there. There are other choices that make no sense. Cops in this universe wear masks to protect their ID, but the main character, played by Regina King, essentially runs around in a Regina King mask.<br/><br/>This whole thing is baffling. The fact that this exists is just bewildering. I never thought that I would miss Zack Snyder so much. Another one in the string of terrible HBO shows with a solid budget for making visual quality but that's about it. I'm still yawning... Why so negative? It is a Great quality show well written and good acting. Good job hbo 👍 "Watchmen" is a violent, gory and incredibly intriguing continuation of the graphic novel of the same name, set several decades after it, and assembles new characters with some of the original as well. It is gripping, full of twists and turns, and filled with moments that make you just go "WTF". Centered around a new protagonist Angela Abar, the plot starts out by presenting the murder of her chief police officer, but gradually extends beyond that to a story that is so much more expansive in spatial and temporal magnitude.<br/><br/>Set in an alternative history that aligns with the graphic novel, it puts us in a world that is familiar yet highly strange to us. Suburban living is as we recognize it today, only to be occasionally interrupted by cars and little squids falling out of the sky. There's the talk of Dr. Manhattan in the streets, essentially a god who has gone to Mars. There are police officers who wear masks. Each episode is layered and crafted so well, that it starts out with different threads, spits out to more storyline threads, and ultimately manages to collect them together cohesively into one incredible narrative.<br/><br/>My personal favorites were Episodes 3, 6, and 8. I particularly liked Episode 3 because we get introduced to one of my favorite characters in the series. Episodes 6 and 8, I believe, capture the essence of the story's weirdness and strangeness best. They are tricky, they are surreal, they move back and forth, and they are packed with unbelievable story points. That's not to say the other episodes were lackluster, each of them did a great job of building up the conflict, leading up to the resolution in Episode 9. However, I did feel that the resolution was a bit too convenient and wasn't as interesting as I hoped it would be, which steered the whole climax towards the anticlimactic side.<br/><br/>The visuals of the series was pretty much beautiful, with some of the scenes being just full of awe. I also like what they did with the title sequences, or the transitions. I felt that they were imbued with some creativity, and some of the transitions were unexpected (moving from a shot of one'e eyes to the stars), which I felt added to the mood of a graphic novel and the strange charm the series has.<br/><br/>The series also has astounding cast, imbuing not only our main character but some of the side characters, with complex motivations and layered backgrounds. Most of the characters that were central to the story felt real and fully-fledged. Some of them were not as fully-constructed, and instead were more identifiable by their eccentric personalities and mannerisms, but none were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>This is one of the best series I have ever seen. It is violent, it is fun, it is mysterious, it is twisting, and it is a ride. This is the unmasking of a cruel, wild, and exhilarating narrative. From the overall story conception to the writing, directing and acting, Watchmen is just brilliant on all fronts. It bests the movie and is worthy of sharing the graphic novel's name and classic legacy by building on and adding to the story and the world it laid out. Really hope Lindeloff can be persuaded to return for a second season but, if not, he gave us a brilliant single season of telelvision If you thought the weird strange confusing film was bad( which it was) then get ready for something worse!!
First off I had hope then it just gets weird with cheap costumes and odd characters!!
Cant be bothered to write much more just give it a miss!!!! I know Alan Moore despises adaptations and I get that. He made a world with his heart and soul and doesn't want anyone mucking it up. I respect that and with that it did influence my initial feelings. I hated the trailers and disliked episode one, and I know I was biased against it.<br/><br/>It would be 6 weeks until I gave episode 2 a shot, and holy... I binged everything available and can't wait for the last episode.<br/><br/>It feels consistent, even with the stuff that "changed". They found clever ways to keep things in line with the comic and I'm blown away by it. Anyone who says otherwise probably didn't keep watching.<br/><br/>I do have nit picky things I wish were different. I don't want to give spoilers so I won't, but they are very minor. Put aside the great directing and sound play, this show is quite good. I believe the hardcore original watchmen fans trashed the first two episodes since it didn't meet the expectations they held but this tv show is brilliant.
I am not gonna talk about the great acting cast or the amazing effort they put into each episode because its an immediate thing you see. But let's give credit to the build up for each event, the pacing and the depth of each character you see is simply great. We are watching one of the most underrated modern day masterpieces unfold.Such beautiful story telling is almost too much to bear.
This is Us meets Game of thrones meets Comic book adaptation Completely original story, that captures the tone of the original graphic novel so much more effectively and beautifully than the movie. I can't get enough of this. Wolks southern accent is downright offensive to southern people! This show on the other hand is pretty good so far. Good cliffhangers haven't quite figured out who's doing what yet but it keeps me coming back for more so keep up the good work HBO. Just please get that actor from Michigan a dialect coach. Does it matter wether it is true to the comics? Maybe. But as someone who Is not a comic book fanatic. This show hit very high marks, surpassing most tv shows out today. The cinematography is brilliant, the cast and acting are incredibly strong too and of course the score. Props to composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The production is also very strong in here and the plot is intriguing and puts an interesting spin on the universe as it ties it to reality. DO NOT pass on this one because you find it different than the comics. Watched it once, enjoyed it....
Watched the ultimate cut off the movie and really enjoyed and understood it!
Went back to the series for a second time and binged it instead off a weekly watch and found it to be some of the best television I've seen in a long time with so many layers and meanings when it actually clicks with you.
Truly brilliant....! This show is incredible ! I have read the graphic novel a long time ago and don't remember it that well, but watching this show brought back the emotions I had at the time. The show is dar, funny, absurd, apocalyptic. The heroes are flawed with a somber side. While the graphic novel was depicting a pirate story in the form of a graphic novel, the show is creating a super violent TV show about hooded justice. I love the parallel of play with mirrors.
It took me a while to realize that the show took place after the comic book and I enjoyed trying to fit together the pieces of the puzzle of how the stories fit together.
The TV show is not a copy of the graphic novel but keeps 100% of the spirit. Boring and not my cup of tea
I must say it follows the comic and it takes place way after the wide screen movie so most people didnt get it but the whole watchmen franchise isnt very catchy
Even the movie was not so great
I cant stand the main actress. Ignore the shallow, borderline spam 1 star reviews that complain about a "liberal agenda" or "sjw"". You have to wonder what makes them so angry about a show having the audacity to put real life events such as Tulsa race riot as the premise. They must obviously hate reality. Most have not read the original comics otherwise they would not be saying foolish phrases like that Watchmen should not be political.<br/><br/>To be frank, I doubt they have watched more than episode if any at all. I reserved judgement on Watchmen and thought I should at least watch episode 2 to see if the show gets any better. Unfortunately in my opinion it does not and that is a shame as I so dearly wanted this to be great TV. Alas it is not great TV and it is not the Watchmen as Alan Moore conceived. The show does have some great camera work and the titles are interesting but the story is obsessed with driving home this white supremacy narrative which I believe actually harms the political cause by using entertainment as a means to educate, politically engage and encourage activism. Racism is abhorrent and should always be challenged but Watchmen is preaching to the choir and is using a very blunt instrument to get its message across. It is so difficult to talk about the show without delving into the politics however if we look solely at the story telling and the characterisations, this is where the show really falls down. The story is weak in comparison to the global threat that was portrayed in Alan Moore's Watchmen and the characters thus far are unbelievable and their motivations are cliche driven. Do you remember when TV was great? Shows like The Wire, Sopranos, Breaking Bad and even Game of Thrones. Very poor HBO. Very poor. After 2 episodes, it's clearer that DC is trying, again, to spin off a new story and characters from their popular story line, just like Gotham and Pennyworth. Gotham did okay. Pennyworth is not worth my penny. Watchmen is different, taking on a whole different approach and mythologies based on Watchmen. I enjoy the ride for now since it did spark my interest. However, whether it will survive 1 season, that is to be seen. So what does that say about IMDB?? Brilliant show.. As a white British man I'm ashamed of our colonial past I love when the norm is challenged! Regina King is Queen! Wait that the hype is gone and then watch the Watchmen series again. It's crap. Pure crap. From all the bad reviewers that are rambling about wanting more of the same to the history of religion I can tell people have a hard time with critical thinking and patience. I get so happy when I see people announcing they're giving up after one episode. One, nobody cares. Two, it says more about you than the show. Do you judge a movie by the opening credits? Because that's what a pilot is.<br/><br/>Implausible? Dr. Manhattan can teleport to Mars. C'mon, the comic was an extremely exaggerated version of reality & this continues in that vein perfectly. Some of these reviewers are living in a fantasy land if they don't think these things exists or isn't a problem, and the show exaggerates it just like the comic exaggerated a lot. There's a blue dude on Mars. Squids are still coming out the sky. Anything can happen.<br/><br/>Slow down. Think things out. Did the first issue of the comic give away everything? No. Did the first issue have current topics of the 80s? Yes. Was it an imaginary world where superheroes exist? Yes.<br/><br/>Some of y'all need to chill on anger over a tv show pilot.<br/><br/>Oh yeah Reznor & Ross are brilliant yet again. I know Alan Moore was screwed over by DC.
I know he never wanted Watchmen to be a series.<br/><br/>That being said, this show was made with all respect to Moore's vision. Those of you who say it is terrible and not what you wanted from Watchmen and its terrible compared to the movie, I pity you. As a continuation of the graphic novel this show more than exceeds my hopes for it and the mystery keeps me coming back. First the good, the imagery is very well done, HBO did a great job as far as visually. The cast is great, their acting and delivery is on point. The dialogue, it suits the characters, and feels/ sounds natural when you hear it.<br/><br/>Now the bad. The plot is clearly politically influenced, this is a comic television show no one came here to see that. The pace of the show, currently we are 7 episodes in, and I feel like only now are we getting actual glimpses of "The Watchmen", for me I started watching for that specifically, so it's been disappointing. Finally the cast is sadly also on the bad list, although great at acting, I like seeing attractive, and charismatic people on my television, and sorry to say it but these people are kind of ugly, and dull... To my tastes, I have never encountered a higher quality comic related piece of time based media.<br/><br/>The acting is hbo quality, which is to say great. The story is complicated but decipherable. The source material is referenced and honored without being retread.<br/><br/>It's a challenging show to watch. It tackles hard topics; it's often not fun. Its bleak and nerve-wracking, in a very insidious way. It's got the vertigo comics feel, full of critical discontent that the watchmen was a core part of and influence on.<br/><br/>Seriously good stuff. It has always been about race. Well done and inspired This is just another alternate reality akin to 'The Man In The High Castle', minus Philip K Dick's vision or any historical references from which to pull from. Basically substitute race with the Nazis/Japanese, and add a few superpowers and well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>While the formula isn't bad, it's biggest problem is that it falls into the trap of being too ham handed, so the storytelling just isn't very good. The attempt at fostering empathy, or establishing any connection with characters through the race-reversal comes off as artificial, if not uncomfortable as textbook stereotypes and bigotry abound.<br/><br/>Too bad, as it could've really been interesting, if not a terrific. But the delivery feels as if they got the whitest Hollywood woke-scold they could find to write and direct it... and as a result the key protagonists come off as artificial cardboard cutouts of what they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>Again, it could've been some much more with the setting and story... but it just seems that someone's agenda got in the way. I did see the Watchmen movie. I did not read the comic books.<br/><br/>Watching 2 episodes of this series I feel like it's generally an entertaining show. I would have liked to see more of a connection with characters from the movie, but I don't feel like that's a big deal-as long as they are rolled out during the course of the season.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action, drama and mystery to make it exciting! Acting is good, and I feel like they're just building the base of the story with the chosen main character and setting. I also like the historical context that is provided. It is a part of U.S. history that may make some people uncomfortable, but oh well. People choose to feel what they feel. In my opinion it does NOT seek to point blame, or make people feel uncomfortable(at least not as its primary purpose). Instead, I think it effectively sets a tone of social and civil tension, and paints a picture of the complexity of American society. Give it a shot! I think it will only get better with each episode. Don't be afraid of a little controversy! Its just that simple...its worth your time trust me. There are TV shows/series we just watch and than there are those that you HAVE to watch!!! and this is one of those. Really don't understand the negative reviews floating around. People have made it a Black vs White narrative series. If you don't fall in this trap it's a pretty fun ride. The episodes get better n better. Don't leave the series after 2-3 episodes, you won't regret it. Really safe to say all the low scoring and votes is coming from people who didn't understand the message of the show who found it racist or who thought it offended the original material. One person denied the events in the opening episode lol that's history that we didn't even learn about in some US schools so that should teach you something right there. They gave us a great origin on HJ because the comic one just didn't do it for alot of people. So to all the people who didnt like it because of the political views what you really mean is the racial under tones I'll say it for you. Lol those things happen sadly and they continue to happen and with out shows like these they will continue to happen but to say it didnt touch with the original source material is just ludacris you werent paying attention you were to angry because you lost focus being to mad about one of the many things that shouldnt exist in the show lmfao I've seen many good shows this year, and this is one of them, storyline is excellent its a pre-post-middling story that includes the first "Watchman", the fact that its not specifically about the comics isnt a problem when its made like this, fuppin' amazing accross the board, musically the classical Mozart bit is a bit tacky, but the rest soundtrack in general is amazing and respective of the time and performers of the times and such, Just watch it, Do it, Go on.................. After 2 episodes by far the best 2 minutes was the "Hooded Justice" scene - this "franchise" was crying out for a Minutemen series / movie - what we're getting so far is fairly disappointing. I recommend ignoring that and watching for yourself. There is good writing, great cinematography and production values, awesome music from Reznor and Ross, and overall lots of promise from this series. If you're offended by  sentiments set in an alternate timeline based on a graphic novel where it rains squids and Robert Redford is president...perhaps this isn't the show for you. This series has lots of promising potential. I recommend watching this and making up your mind for yourself. Great production values, super cool cinematography, solid writing, awesome music from Reznor and Ross... if you are offended by anti-racist sentiments set in an alternate fictional timeline based on a graphic novel about superheroes where it rains squids and Robert Redford is president, perhaps you should find something different to watch. This is a show about fighting racism i am a white man who strongly disagrees with white nationalism and this is the perfect time for a show like this it is action packed filled with values and good messages about things in todays world however while the shows outstanding its highly adult and not recommended for young kids graphic violence language nudity tons of adult material but good good show Superb music and acting with great pace. Try to ignore People who complain about the show not being "a watchmen" show. A comic show's merit is not based upon it being a copy-paste of source material as it makes it bland and predictable. It's amazing to see the creators come up with story of their own based on comics, shout out to you guys.
I do however have one criticism, lack of pre-show exposition. For someone who hasn't watched the movie or read the comics will be hard to understand the plot. Great continuation of the movie/graphic novel. Exciting new characters, packed with Easter eggs for the fans and great action<br/><br/>I hope all of the negativity does not bring the show down Original graphic novel of Watchmen took place in an alternate America where Nixon had one. Other than that what else is a Horrifying moment in America's history and still is happening to this day. The treatment of black people. Smart move to then show a fictional TV show upping the anty on an otherwise horrendous topic. Is this the Graphic Novel....No. Is the the film adaptation ....No. This is a TV show trying something new and I for one liked it. Only the pilot viewed but I'm looking forward to the next installment and to read more reviews from the hill folk of America. Wow what an experience! I finished this series just before Christmas and was planing to make this review earlier but I didn't know how to approach it.<br/><br/>During the show's first two episodes I felt conflicted on wether or not I really truly enjoyed it but when episode three came round I was hooked from that point to the end.<br/><br/>I can honestly understand why people don't enjoy this show I mean it's clearly not for everyone especially those who are a big fan of the Zack Snider movie, which I thought was okay, and I can respect those who give it a low rating or bad review because at the end of the day it's your opinion on wether you like this show or not<br/><br/>I'm also glad we won't be getting a second season because even though I think this show is great I don't want it to be ruined by endless seasons and recycled storylines.<br/><br/>My favourite episode of the season was six- this extraordinary being Because it explored the origin of what a realistic vigilante would be portrayed as and what would motivate them in a grounded and thought-provoking way. It is also really smart storytelling to show it from the the perspective of Angela Abar.<br/><br/>My least favourite episode of the season was two- martial feats of Comanche horsemanship because nothing really happened that drove the plot or the characters in meaningful ways and was just there to set up what was to come.<br/><br/>The finale was great and concluded everything in a MOSTLY satisfying way.<br/><br/>In the end I believe watchmen should be up there with some of the greatest shows ever broadcasted on tv and just give it a view years and people will be raving about it.<br/><br/>10/10 This show is sadly all about Dr. Manhatten's dating life. And offer extrememly little apart from that. And to be honest, for me it was very boring. I do get that some of you want the love story, and no action what so ever. If that is the case, this is the show for you. I for one will never rewatch this. I stayed for the entire show, hoping something would happen. But to no avail. Update: Just finished it and loved it, so very well done<br/><br/>People complaining that episode 1 was confusing--umm it's a 9-episode story, did you expect conflict resolution right out of the gate?<br/><br/>And to those complaining that it's not directly out of the comics or the movie: I'm glad for that. Because I've already read the novel and saw the movie. Why rehash the same story? I'm thoroughly confused as to the number of people moaning about not being close enough to the source material. But why would you want that? This new story based on Watchmen lore is so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>Either way, 8 episodes in and I'm truly engrossed in this story and its characters. My favorite one so far was the flashback episode... it was so incredibly done!<br/><br/>Also hats off to Angela Abar, I have a good feeling she'll get nominated for best lead for her performance.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the finale--this story is looking to culminate in an epic way! While reading bad reviews I wanted to be able to answer so badly. They all should know that they have bad taste cz this show is a masterpiece. It's one of my favorite tv shows now. Cinematography, plot, soundtrack, characters... everything is just perfect. Truly gripping story line and beautiful acting from amazing actors. It is a must watch series! Here's hoping for a season 2! Don't think of it as an adaption of the graphic novel and it'll be the best show you've seen in a while. Thank me later. Watchmen season 1 is a mixed-bag, but it is certainly watchable. It is rare that a show can rolodex my emotions, and there were times I just found myself feeling disconcerted and confused. The series is both a sequel and a prequel to the Watchmen movie, but it doesn't do much to tie in core elements of the original. Sure, there is a loose connection to the original, but this is performed mainly by shoehorning some characters in for notoriety, I suppose.<br/><br/>The story had wonderful elements at times, especially episode six, that captured the art of filmmaking at its best. But if you are not a fan of having a thrilling sequence followed by a, "what the heck is this garbage" sequence, then you may find yourself hating this show. This is a very simple story that I feel the creators boiled in a level of complexity that doesn't make it fun for the entirety of the series. I will give the cinematographer and the director a round of applause on always changing the tone of the scene and the characters involved, so that there is an honest feeling to what is being presented.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely incredible for most of the main characters, but the side characters left a little to be desired. Character motivations were often unclear, but I believe this clouded judgement was necessary for a number of reveals later on in the series. I do want to highlight Tim Blake Nelson's performance the most. His character is very monotone, but you can instantly recognize something is different about him. "The Looking Glass," as he is called, is packing a whopping character arc that will leave you breathless. Similarly, Louis Gossett Jr.'s character experiences a multitude of life events that sends him into the brink of disillusionment.<br/><br/>I feel that race is something that triggers people, no matter the medium in which it is presented. Even though race has a major part of the overall storyline, it is done in a different way that interested me. Yes, there were some heavy-handed sections that threw me off the train track a few times, but for the most part, I feel the writers were passionate about it. However, even though this is an extreme version of fiction, I couldn't get past one glaring item on this agenda. This is not a spoiler, as it is revealed in the first episode, but the idea of police wearing masks is kind of ridiculous. This would never happen, and there are other details surrounding this element that make no sense, whatsoever.<br/><br/>If we as cinephiles cannot overcome some of the annoying or just plain stupid parts of this as a whole, we may not get too many more of these chances of alternate superhero storylines. Give this a shot, and you be the judge as to whether you think it stinks as much as a million squid raining down on your windshield. Personally, I think this is a good attempt at creating a unique and mysterious world. A lot of work is needed if this is going to be a regular show, but hats off to HBO for embracing a new kind of weird. Thoroughly enjoyable so far. Lots of nods and winks to the original, but it is taking its own path. Decent production values and plenty of little side plots waiting to be weaved together. Great cast and decent enough acting. Those complaining about it being 'woke', it is, but not in an overpowering way. I don't see why folk have a problem with female leads, and I get that the racism message is blunt, but those criticising the angle, should maybe take a look in the mirror. Just hoping the pace keeps up, and the payoff is worthy by the end. A good start.<br/><br/>For those looking for a remake of the original film you will disappointed.<br/><br/>A very weird spin on the source material.<br/><br/>It's hard to say at this point, but give it a chance it seems to be getting stronger by each episode but it is definitely missing something. Yeah it's about racism, yeah its about, sexism, yeah it's super PC.
I'm not even gonna complain about that. Have you seen their costumes? The style of this "Watchmen" is honestly lacking. That's one thing this comic had was style. This show has zerrrrrro I was like,screw it I want to see her just punching people,turned out this so good !
I hope they r making season 2 now !!!!! I see a lot of people say how fans of the original graphic novel shouldn't like this series. But I absolutely love it. The performances, the mystery, and that sense of confusion all remind me of the original work. Also that score.....Such great cinematography as well and the writing is solid. So looking forward to where it goes in the next 7 episodes. I have to say that any resemblance to watchmen is pure coincidence. It doesn't even seem they tried to make a good show. The lack of characters and of a real story is evident since the very beginning. I find it amusing that people complain about a show being too political if it doesn't match their own politics. Well done, HBO. Another great show! Great show, great acting, and beautiful to watch. Never saw the movie nor read the comics, so I'm pretty sure all the 1, 2 and 3 stars are from people not rating THIS particular show, but from people with the wrong expectations. It was said EVERYWHERE it was an adaptation. I'm guessing people are having trouble with that word, although I do understand the feeling. First of all, I'm not American but that being said, I love it when comic book show/film successfully makes reference of real world occurrence .<br/><br/>This is very well adapted and is not in the same ballpark compared to the DC Batgirl. This is actual history, and 'Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it'. To all the viewer who found the show ok-ish or great, don't let bad audience review fools you. I love this show. I read the graphic novels growing up. Just finished episode 7 and my mind is blown!!! Watch it 420 Style!!! Creative, funny, mysterious, beautiful cinematography, superb acting. Don't let the haters dissuade you! Veidt is trying to create his own Dr Manhattan. To me this is weird because if it was good idea, John would have already made a race of his own kind. I get why Veidt wants one, he thinks he'll be able to control it. Silk Spectre has become a thoroughly disillusioned person who now sees a bunch of wannabees trying to be "suits". She doesn't think anybody is justified being a suit. In her mind, everybody goes to hell and deserves to go to hell.<br/><br/>I'm concerned about clones. It could ruin the show. How? Anybody could be one! It makes me think that the big surprise could be this show is simply a mash up of Westworld and Watchmen. Where no death or action could have any consequence because the character could be right back in the next episode. Replaced by a clone, or having been replaced by a clone long ago.<br/><br/>Obviously somebody is manipulating this whole coming civil war that's going to happen on the show. We're constantly shown a lot of the public protesting. I think the political figure is a clone. But then again, many of these people could be.<br/><br/>I'm guessing Veidt has created his nemesis to practice his skills. Kind of a take on the old Batman created his arch enemies, and vice versa. Anyways this is where I see this going. Everybody is ALL just puppets in a puppet show.<br/><br/>All in all it was an improvement but I still have reservations. Veidt did what he did to save mankind. He rationalized it as the sacrifice of millions to save billions. This older Veidt doesn't seem to care at all. I loved Watchmen back in the 80s! The movie was silly, so I had zero expectations for this. But, friends kept saying this was great. So I took a chance.<br/><br/>I made it all the way through to the end! That's something. It was incredibly enjoyable to watch and the acting was almost completely excellent. Some of the side stories were also enjoyable and very well made. However, I just didn't get it. What was I supposed to care about? It's another superhero thing, albeit incredibly well produced, directed and acted. I felt nothing about the universe it created and no real emotion towards any of the characters and stories.<br/><br/>In some ways, it felt to me like some stuff was cut out, some development, some growth, etc. Maybe it was? I'm not sure much would help. Thankfully, I haven't read Watchmen in 30 years, so I can't whine about how close it was to the original; I doubt that would matter anyway.<br/><br/>Reading a few reviews here, it's hilarious that there are ANY right wing people that lasted past a few episodes. Yes, it was a liberal love-in throughout. Fine. I get the obvious, ham-fisted, feel-good points they were trying to make. Good on them for that (those are needed now). But, this wasn't trying to change minds; nor was it complicated or deep. Yes, they overlapped time and stories a lot to make you think it was complicated; but it really wasn't. It felt overly gimmicky.<br/><br/>Oh well. I watched it and I don't regret it. Entertaining, but not much else to pick apart here. Such a good show
The foreshadowing is insane and by episode 7 this show has a huge reveal that leaves you speechless.<br/><br/>Avoid spoilers as much as possible but I do recommend watching the watchmen movie or reading the comics if you don't want to be 100 percent lost. I've done both and the show will keep you questioning. And it definitely gives you answers that leaves you with more questions Every reason I've heard so far for the dislike of this show is stupid. Giving this 10/10 to get the rating up because it deserves more than a 7. I waited until I saw several episodes but this is not anything close to the comic book. This show is about the most confusing shows I have watched on television today. One of the most underrated series like the leftovers.
Spectacular writing acting and camera work. Love it please keep it going! This series is brilliant. The themes and philosophical questions established by the graphic novel are front and foremost, but updated to our new reality. Just as the more innocent times of the 1940's made way for the cynical 1980's , the 1980's are giving way to our present reality where facts and fiction are not merely in the eye of the beholder, but in their preferences. The masked policemen are virtually indistinguishable from the masked vigilantes, just as the good guys are from the bad guys. As a reflection of today's society in which we are more linked together and at the same time more divided, this sums it up. The new characters are intriguing, specially Sister Justice played by the excellent Regina King. Silk Spectre 2 ( now an FBI agent ) and Oxymandias ( now an aging recluse with a seemingly crazy agenda) are also present. Also looming in the horizon is Dr Manhattan who is living on Mars and the ultimate fate of Owlman ( presumed dead ?) I look forward to future episodes. It's sad to see fans of the comic hate on this. It's a beautiful piece of collaboration which is lead by show runner Damon Lindelof. Honestly, if you like the comic why not rejoice in the fact that a fan of the comic got the chance to continue the story.
The comic ended on a cliffhanger so isn't it awesome that HBO hired an actual fanboy to continue the story? I think the real hatred probably stems from  because the show reveals how racism can get out of control. Firstly, the score... is nothing short of brilliant. Trent and Atticus are at their peak.
Relevance to the comic or movie: the underlying menace and theatrical world that features in both is there. Yes there are some differences, yes the characters take on new roles in the narrative but overall I find it true to the premise in this dystopian universe.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this show. It's a really interesting take on the watchmen lore and it does deviate from the source material quite a bit which might let down some viewers expectations if they were fans of the 2009 movie and/or the original Alan Moore comic but if I'm being honest that's what makes it so great for me you never really know what to expect with each coming episode it keeps it fresh instead of it being "formulaic" No head. No tail.<br/><br/>I couldn't make head nor tail of this damn serie.<br/><br/>I tried to watch the first and the second episode. It'sa non sense, no plot, no story to tell.<br/><br/>Moreover, is boring and confused. The actors act bad and the photography is bad as well.<br/><br/>The unique thing I'd save is the 30" music at the end of each episode, signing the end of the same.<br/><br/>Not worth to be seen. Yes it's not true to the original graphic novel. Yes it's nothing like the movie. But some of these ratings are laughable. It's ONE episode in and imo it was a great one. Google Tulsa 1921. You'll be surprised. The acting is spot on. The casting is great. The costumes are brilliant and thank god it's not laden with CGI. I say give it time. This could become a classic. ...and i am a happy white boy. Plot is boring and stupid. We had enough of this leftist propaganda. Dont mind the low iq people saying this is not good. This cant be not good. Its creator is mastermind Damon Lindelof and first episode was great.
Only one episode aired and i understand why all the hate. We live in right wing world where hatered is on first place, and toward this series is because of that A lot of "fans" giving bad reviews here clearly didn't read the graphic novel, nor do they know ANYTHING about Alan Moore. In fact if you understand the basis for Rorschach and read his journal, you know he wasn't a good guy. These wanna be fanboys bemoaning the "wokeness" of the series miss the irony of their own existence. People who took the original text, out of context and utterly convinced of the rightness of their very erroneous position. Laughable really. Regardless of all that, the show I'd well written. Regina King shines but she's not the only stand out. Great cast, interesting characters and so far, nifty oft ignored, bits of history in the beginning of every episode. I loved everything about Watchmen. A true masterpiece.<br/><br/>I do not know anything about the original watchmen but maybe somedsy i will.<br/><br/>No matter what, this Watchmen series has everything that a piece of cinematic art needs. Good story,good characters,all connected in the end for a satisfying ending. Definitely one of the best new age dark sci fi shows ever. Real depth and although some of the stuff is out of this world it's very believable. Consider this a privilege to watch, try and not binge watch it enjoy it 1 episode at a time and savour it. I'm looking forward to watching it a second time soon. Started of slow, but I stuck with it, all I'm going to say is Great, Great, Great
Lots of Echoes from the Movie in here, can't wait for season 3 <ul><li>Laurie led a blue god into depression</li><li>Yet she makes the final move, blaming Ozymandias to be massacrer of millions while he actually saved the world twice</li><li>She is useless, I haven't seen even one smooth action from her "WHY IS SHE HANGING AROUND?</li><li>Dystopian noir nature of Watchmen is no more, here we have a average DC comic adaptation without its real creaters' contribution.</li></ul> The first episodes are ok-ish with some unexplainable scenes, and I continued to watch because I like the Watchmen movie. I certainly didn't expect the series to become this excellent and hilarious. This is old-school HBO quality, and I wish I could be Dr. Manhattan to tell my past self to pay more attention right from the start. The good: great CGI and Beautiful shots, good actors.<br/><br/>The bad: I've only seen the first episode, maybe it will get better but my complaints are: Overall vibe was stressful, music was too much, story is uninteresting.<br/><br/>After the first episode I feel like there is a very small group of people who will enjoy it. I was mostly bored, and even looking at my phone was not enjoyable because the background sound was overwhelming.<br/><br/>Overall this show was absurd and not really any build up, just straight to the action. Ignore all the hatred from the trolls that never even read the original graphic novel. You can spot them by their use of the word "comics". It was one story, not a series. This is a continuation of the graphic novel and NOT the movie so any mention of the Zack Snyder film is irrelevant and should be ignored. This show definitely has the same tone of the source material so if you have a problem with it, you were never a fan or never understood it to begin with. You probably use the terms SJW or "agenda" when reviewing this pilot and titled it "Wokemen" pretending to be clever and original. Like one other reviewer mentioned, the only bad thing bad it is the lack of exposition for those that never read the graphic novel. The squid storm was probably extremely weird and confusing to some. I suggest watching it with an open mind and if you don't like it, move on to something less cerebral and run of the mill. Admirable job of tying in relevant global social issues while maintaining the distinctive weirdness that is the Watchmen legacy. While not directly based on the current comics or the 2009 Zack Snyder movie, the influence and willingness to push the viewer to see beyond what's "normal" is exactly what makes Watchmen great, and it's served up deliciously in this new series.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see how this plays out. Ignore the insulted dudebros crying in the reviews. This is good TV. I don't yet embrace the characters. They so far don't meet the high standard of relatable characters that are usually the cornerstone in a HBO series. Will give them a couple of episodes to sway me.<br/><br/>The first scene was shocking. More so that I was ignorant of its existence in history until this episode.<br/><br/>Anyone who complains it's not from the movie, this first episode suggests that it more from the comics. I personally believe that there are certainly a story-telling presentation aspect of it that are very similar to Dave Gibbon's(The artist of the comic books)<br/><br/>Anyone who complains that it's too political, reread or read for the first time the graphic novel. It's hella political. So the season premiere looks amazing aesthetically, great action, effects and good acting. As a huge fan of the comics I am intrigued but also cautious about how the story will go cause Lindeloff has made some good stuff but also some overly complex unsatisfying stuff so we'll see. Hopefully it turns out good. Totally heartless. I see the review scores are going up though. Probably the normie
sleepers fault who aren't up to date with the current state of affairs. It's truly a sad, plastic world of 2019 AD. Acting and production value alone gives you 6 stars. Throw in some clever alternate universe ideas, some futuristic designs based on one of the most beloved fictional universes of the last 30 years and you get at least 8 or 9 stars.<br/><br/>So don't listen to the really bizzare 1-3 star reviews, those people need serious help emotionally and or intellectually.<br/><br/>It really is a good series that only requires you to have seen the film. Everyone seams to think there are no racists in the south of the US anymore so they are mad that its depicted in the show. Just keep watching because this is a cleaver show that goes deeper than just race As we are today on a verge of social disarray with identity politics this day in age. This show along with its original story have brought to the forefront of what makes humans tick.
I honestly feel this show has a much more deeper meaning as much like the original graphic novellas of the past.
Bring the vast reaches of time and space into our precieved value of importance in the universe alone with Docter Manhattans forever daunting presence in the frame work of the show really gives you a sense of how frigged up this universe actually really is, and just how very primitive we are.
If people are wanting something to think about while they watch this. This is for you, but it really does show the polar opposites of how class differentiation can impact a group of people very much like the "Stanford Prison Experiment". When one body politic is forced to be a certin way they will need to adapt to its environment. The misrepresentation of Rorschach's mask being one of those principles; because he is to be believed from the book and also film that he is the beaken of righteousness. Like most stuff from HBO (and Hollywood), gratuitous male frontal nudity (penis) and toxic male stereo types. A fine example of one of the many double standards in modern entertainment (female genitalia is taboo). Nothing interesting. I specifically made an account just to leave a review here because I can't understand why there's so much hate for this!
I personally loved it, it's so different from everything else on tv and seeing alt earth in 2019 without the show holding my hand was great. I had no idea about the Tulsa massacre before watching this and a lot of those issues back then are still so relevant today, so I'm glad I also learned a big piece of American history that doesn't deserve to be forgotten by history the way it has.
All in all, lived it can't wait for more ðŸ˜ƒ A lot of the negative reviews on here are clearly written by people who watched 1-2 episodes or completely misunderstood the point of the graphic novel and thus series. This series is NOT an adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel and it's corresponding film. It is a sequel to the novel (not the movie because it changes a few key story aspects) adding on to the story, showing the aftermath of Watchmen 30 years later. The characters are almost entirely new, and the story is original. People will claim that this show is overly political and thus clearly misunderstood the original Watchmen if they read it at all. The original novel was just as political, and just as liberal as this show is. And Rorschach was always racist, this isn't news to anybody who understood the novel. Rorschach was a racist, sexist, homophobic antisemite and it isn't that surprising that his image was taken up by a group of white supremacist vigilantes. The show is a worthy continuation of the original masterpiece and if you read and understood the novel I think you will enjoy the series. This show was truly amazing. Every episode had me gripped on the edge of my seat and counting down the hours till the next episode. The direction, story and cast was perfect. The 1 star reviews I found funny as they either did not have the intelligence to follow the story lines or were just plain. As you can see from the reviews, it's making all the incel white supremacists nerds uncomfortable. This fact alone it's already a big reason why you should see this. The plot is well rounded and I just can't why to see the next episode! Marvelous, Really Really Marvelous. I really loved this show. I also got more than my expectations. The storyline is amazing. It's totally cool. Every Watchmen fan should watch this. If you start watching this, you really can't stop this. Wonderful.......even better than the novel......Also far more intricately woven......only bad ratings on 21st october by some supreme complex only MAAARVELLA paid people.......who dont want to see anyone...and so corner them with poor reviews on IMDB......i am absolutely loving it............. morality is echoed in the complex plotting, with a bunch of dark characters in a very strange, dark, violent world and a story arc is full of mysteries.Damon Lindelof was superlative with this series.....and some people just want to be offended......Fanboys beware...some great stories are coming up...in a absolute presentation......please stay vigilant and progressive with your potrayals, stories and representation.......DC has always been like human nature..... I really don't know what is happening anymore, but I think I like it. I expected a more than average crime story about a woman persues a kkk like group. But holy shit I didn't expect this much mindfuck and plottwist. One of a kind. Awesome all around... I love how the show keeps you wondering... I cannot believe all the negative reviews.... HBO has nailed it again. This team has Done an amazing job making the watchmen name their own.... Definetly throws a lot of homage to the comics for a show that's not based of of the comics... More of a possible outcome after the movie if the squid from the comics was in the movie... I love the little things in it Watchmen gives us a reflective picture of what could have possibly taken place after the events of the Watchmen movie. Not only does it incorporate real life historical events into the story, it makes it relatable to the world today. Possible reparations for black people, and the ensuing revitalization of white supremacy groups. Anyone saying it is racist propaganda, watch the show even closer, because more than likely...they're talking about you. Coupled with superb acting and a compelling story that keeps you guessing, this show's development is trending towards a positive direction. So yes this isn't a regurgitation of the movie with the same title. If you are only looking for that and not looking to allow your mind to experience something new and more intricate and sophisticated, than this show is not for you.
I watched the first episode myself and thought what the F is this?? Honestly I didn't love it but something told me to keep going and I'm glad I did. If you let go of your expectations of what this should be, it is quite a remarkable viewing experience. It is just odd enough and just interesting enough to make your mind expand and ponder. The acting and writing are top notch, just as I would expect HBO to be and thankfully I didn't get a show that was overall what I expected. Great story awesome actors can't wait to see the rest of the series. LONG LIVE THE WATCHMEN Expect for the first episode which is gripping ,
It's a loose storyline with really bad execution and plots.
You can visually see low quality of production design, direction and editing .
HBO is a name to reckon with when it comes to tv dramas,but wasting money earned from game of thrones like this is spooling the brands image . What they have done to Rorschach deserves nothing but sheer contempt. All season it was interesting.
It looked like it had a point, while staying true to original (at least for me)
The last episode ruined everything.
All the plot points ended with the silliest of possibilities
it is like someone made a TV series of "romeo and juliet" and at the last minute they both stand up saying "It is just a prank bro"
Thanks, got it, no need to continue I think the creators missed an opportunity. The original Watchmen comic book and movie dealt with nuclear war between the US and Russia. Given the recent headlines regarding new tensions between the US and Russia, I feel like the creators could've stayed on that theme but instead they made it about racism and white supremacy. Don't get me wrong, racism and white supremacy are important topics that should be explored in popular media, but there is no shortage of movies and TV shows that address these issues. Very few movies and TV shows seem willing to broach the topic of nuclear war and I feel like that is a huge missed opportunity for this series, especially when the source material did it so well. I don't dislike the new direction they're taking, it still looks good and I am willing to give it a chance. It just doesn't feel like Watchmen to me. It's not terrible, and it even had some really well done scenes and likable characters, but it's not Watchmen, either. But here we go again, being force-fed this tired PC racebaiting agenda right into our face-holes, as if we didn't just get done purging the last feeding-tube guilt-trip smoothie.<br/><br/>But I gotta say, I'm not feeling so guilty. Maybe I should find something to feel guilty about so I'm not feeling left out?<br/><br/>After-all, my family came over from France and Spain in the early 1900's and kept to themselves. Maybe I can dig back into France and Spain's rocky past's to find some former atrocity to feel guilty about, and cry myself to sleep on the floor of my shower every night with the cold water running at the very thought of the Inquisition. I guess the saying "time heals all wounds" doesn't apply when it comes to garnering government welfare checks from a guilt-ridden government.<br/><br/>At any rate, if anyone this day in age needs a lesson in the downsides of racism, then they certainly aren't going to learn anything worthwhile from a try-hard TV series. The way I see it, it's another attempt from Hollywood to line their pockets at the expense of the people they claim to be supporting.<br/><br/>They act like they're just so down with the plight of the common person, all the while living in the lap of luxury. It's no better than what the media is doing on a regular basis, and is about par for the course for nearly every institution in this country. And everyone just eats it up because they think that's how they're supposed to act out of fear of not being PC enough while in the spotlight.<br/><br/>In this series, white means evil and black means humanity's savior. The issue I have with this is that we're going from one extreme to the other, instead of the "equality" that everyone claims they want. Nah, people don't want equality. They want to have this "perceived" power for themselves so that they can use it to engage others by force. It's just another case of postmodernists not knowing their behind from a hole in the ground. It's real easy to ignore the facts when you have a generations-long guilt-trip creating a natural aversion to them. Where I come from, we call this "ignorance."<br/><br/>They claim white privilege, essentially reducing all human motivation to one thing: power. You don't do that for the sake of equality; you do that so that you can engage in acts of force.<br/><br/>You don't get to reduce all human motivations to one motivation like that.<br/><br/>You might ask why would you want to reduce all human motivations to power? It's so that you can USE POWER! That's why. You can justify the use of power... That's force! You don't have to engage in civilized debate, you don't have to give a damn about the facts, especially if you're a postmodernist, because you don't believe in facts anyway.<br/><br/>Power is a tempting prospect because it seems an answer to your fears. Fearful people hurting others so they don't have to be afraid anymore. What use is there in perpetuating that? I'll tell you, it's so you don't have to learn how to argue your side of things. It's so you don't have to explain yourself in ways that others can understand. And isn't that the major dividing factor in society today? Not a difference in skin pigment, but an inability to properly communicate?<br/><br/>It won't be your racist great uncle suffering through this use of force. It'll be your grandchildren, and their children.<br/><br/>One extreme to the other.. The thing is, the newest generations weren't around for the extremes committed in the past, but who do you think will suffer through the extremes of the future? Hollywood needs to understand that overall people don't want shows about racism. If you want to tell a story about racism I get it, it is real and there are some really compelling stories around that very subject.<br/><br/>But making super hero shows about that is just a bad idea!<br/><br/>We love superhero movies/shows to get away from real life. Nobody wants to watch a show that is designed to make them feel bad or guilty for something they are not responsible for. Also, putting the very real problem and history of racism is such a fantastical (squid raining) world makes it seem fantastical and doesn't have the "deep" impact you're trying to cheaply buy.<br/><br/>Stop shoving agendas and make something of quality based on your writing ability.<br/><br/>Also, let's just break this down logically. This show is VERY Americanized, therefore it's reasonable to assume it's made for American audiences. about 72%-75% of all Americans are white. Around 16% are black.<br/><br/>I DON'T CARE HOW "WOKE" YOU ARE, every white person who watched this had the same thought within 10 minutes "Oh geez, more race stuff". Whether that thought is right or wrong it happened. Like I said nobody wants to feel guilty about things that they didn't do while watching TV. So is this show for the 16% of your audience that's black?<br/><br/>Empathy trumps all in film and TV. If you want to make money don't make content that isn't about race, about race. We all know what we're getting into with great films like Green Book and Remember the Titans. It is integral to the story. But when you just shove it into a story so you can seem more enlightened than the rest of us it's just distracting and belittling of a real issue.<br/><br/>Also, I gave this a 3 because it's early enough along to save itself. This is such peak 2019 faux social justice bull crap.<br/><br/>The entire premise is made to appeal to liberals wanting their worldview parroted back to them. And yet, all the violence happens to the black people, in the most horrific ways. The only way Hollywood knows how to lift black people up is to constantly repeat the trauma they've sustained for dramatic effect. Also they open with a black woman wearing asian garb and saying she's from Saigon, when clearly she's not asian she's just an asian-looking black woman. And of course they have the stupid ching-chong-plink-plonk asian zither music accompanying... seriously hollywood, if you're gonna try to be progressive about race, don't also at the same time shamelessly traffic in stereotypes.<br/><br/>Apart from the show's political confusion... yeah there's not much to it beyond that. It spends so much time cashing in on the zeitgeist that it doesn't actually create any kind of compelling story. Nice production tho. Damon Lindelof is a hack. It's been known for a very long time. His film credits as a writer are always either bland (Cowboys & Aliens, World War Z) or asinine (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Prometheus), painfully unfinished (Lost, The Leftovers) or even just plain butchery of another's work (Tomorrowland, Watchmen). Note how Watchmen is an example, and this is for good reason, as Lindelof himself in an open letter confirmed that he had one thing in mind when it came to making a sequel to Watchmen: destroying and dismantling Alan Moore's arguable masterwork and replacing it with his own story that had almost nothing to do with it. To be fair, he succeeded.
If he had made his own surreal racially charged supernatural cop drama that would've been one thing, and despite his efforts it might even have worked, but he didn't. He had to throw in and thoroughly misunderstand characters from the beloved comic series in the hope that it would draw attention. Again, to be fair, he succeeded. For better or worse.
What we ended up getting was a snarky mess of a series filled with unlikable characters on every side of the political spectrum, obvious plotting and even more obvious plot twists, one-liners so stupid that they've managed to enter meme territory, classic characters who are essentially the complete opposite of how they ended up by the end of the comic regardless of the amount of sense it makes, and Jeremy Irons putting in far too much effort in a show that never gave a damn.
I will say this much. The segments involving Irons are legitimately interesting and actually do feel at least somewhat Watchmen-like, though more of a Grant Morrison affair than an Alan Moore one. They entertained and the simple escape plot was actually enough for even Lindelof to manage to figure out. But then again, it climaxed with a fart joke, so take that as an indicator.
But hey, now that it's probably cancelled, at least Lindelof managed to do the impossible and prove Dr. Manhattan wrong. Some things do end. Whilst the TV series is certainly inspired by the landmark Graphic Novel and in some ways assumes a knowledge of that work... The TV series is nevertheless an entertaining and very unique take on the Watchmen world.<br/><br/>Some referenced elements are slight alterations to the original story, including the history of the Minutemen who were the precursors to the vigilante, crime fighting Watchmen!<br/><br/>However by setting itself post the original story, it allows itself the space for creative expansion on themes, some contemporary, some in line with the world within which it is set.<br/><br/>Both fans of the Graphic Novel, and people new to it will find this original work an enjoyable and well crafted story with all the intricacies and challenging social themes for which it is known.<br/><br/>It ends on a fun cliffhanger, with a few loose ends, which indicate that delivering a second season is more or less confirmed! Can't wait! This series is the most messed up defication I've watched in ages. Starting at a sad point in our own history, you're taken to an alternate reality in the present. The conspiracies and the nature of the inset rot of what a country could be is pretty scary. The great acting and soundtrack (the soundtrack is very awesome) paired with tense moments, mystery, twists, betrayals and action have made this a great series. Love it. Nothing ever ends. The reviews here are the sad proof of that. Hands down the best tv series of the decade. I'm a huge fan of the original graphic novel and an even bigger fan of Zack Snyder's film, and this new series is a fabulous continuation of the Watchmen universe. The quality of the writing is exemplary, as is to be expected from the creator of The Leftovers. I'm six episodes in and already it's in my top five best series ever. Truly brilliant. Great acting, very twisted and interesting plot and to top it off an almost perfect soundtrack. Do not listen to the haters and give it a chance!! Had such high hopes for this series after loving the graphic novel and movie. But, I feel like this series is just about making people look evil and racist. Everyone who says that this isn't the watchmen has never read the comic book. It takes place in a present day that has been shaped by the events of the comic book. That much is the simple truth. These trolls are just trying to bomb the ratings because they are alt right trash. Don't believe me? Just listen to Roger Ebert: " As great as these performances are, "Watchmen" has a cumulative power that comes from every aspect of its production. Scenes can stand alone-the prologues are especially powerful and Irons' scenes as Adrian Veidt are surreal and captivating-but it's the overall mood, tone, and thematic exploration that brings it all together. Rarely have I been more and more impressed with a show as each episode unfolded. The book had a similar power, wowing you with its world building in early chapters, but feeling even richer when it was complete. It is often cited as a game-changer for its entire medium. The show could find a similar fate." Only two episodes in so it is hard to review. So do not listen to the negative reviews. I've been blown away. The tone of the show is very similar to the original graphic novel. Alan Moore could had written it himself. Some people do not like that it is not directly related to the original characters(yet). But I actually love the fact that this is a story outside of the original characters, and will somehow be such a big story that the original characters will be drawn into it and give us a huge "AH-HA!" type of moment. There are other problems in the world outside of the Cold War, and I love to see these issues are hashed out in the Watchmen universe. My only issue is this, and maybe I am looking into it too much: the internet is a huge reason why the social justice movements and racial justice movements are the way they are today. By no means am I saying the internet is why they exist. I am saying the internet has helped transform these movements into the movements that are being visualized in the show. I understand the thought process, because these issues exist with internet or no internet. But I think with just the mass amount of technology we have already seen in the show, why would they ignore the internet as an important piece of the modern world? That is all. I absolutely love it. If it was all released at once, I would watch every episode in a single sitting. The show had a very good beginning and its very fun to watch
Just ignore the HBO haters
The show is amazing as the film Dead give away to a troll written review is "I rarely write reviews but feel I have to" ,"Don't Watch This" , "Waste of Time" etc Why because they feel offended because the show is pushing an agenda or they only have hate for anything that represents some truth to what's relevant to what's going on in out country past and present. Or it could be a simple reason they are just haters in general.
Watchmen starts off in spectacular fashion and does not stop especially during the 2nd episode. It's special Fx , set design, Costumes , storytelling, acting and most things an HBO show gives you more often than not...The best possible quality Shows. There's a reason their tagline use to be" It's Not TV It's HBO"
Anyway do Yourself a favor a give this show a chance ..most people will like it. The fact that all the trolls came out and wrote a review(or a few dozen) telling you not to should say a lot. I loved the Watchmen graphic novel and was extremely excited by the prospect of the television series based on those comics. As a result, I was initially very disappointed when I found so little that I recognised in episode 1. The characters aren't the same, the story's not the same, this is clearly not what I had hoped for. It is, however, very much in the spirit of the original Watchmen, exploring the zeitgeist and anxieties of our time. I think people complaining about it being "woke" are missing the point that the original series was left-leaning and focused on the social concerns of the late eighties. There is also an element of reductio ad absurda in the presentation of racial and gender issues, a certain hyperbole that is both appropriate to the comic book format (villains must be villainous, it requires moral certainty) that is also reflective. It's a beautifully presented fantasy, with great tension, strong writing, good acting, that takes a comic-book approach to exploring difficult issues and challenging perceptions. It'd be a mistake to take it too seriously or to miss the parallels with the original. It has great mood in pilot
Absolutely great soundtrack
Good acting<br/><br/>I'm looking forward at ahead episodes Great acting, beatifully shot, an expansion of some very interesting themes from the original story. All in all a very good, thought provoking pilot that gets you really interested in what follows next, I'm definitely hooked. I don't understand what all the hate is about? After having watched the first episode, I was impressed, and my expectations exceeded. Anyone rating this below a seven is likely influenced by the political aspects, but politics aside, the characters and plot are very well done and the concept is interesting. I hope future episodes can meet the standard of the pilot and build what seems to be a promising 'hero' series. I just finished watching Watchmen (on HBO; 2019 release; 9 episodes of about an hour each). Let me state upfront that I knew nothing about the prior history of Watchmen. In fact, I am in general not a fan of yet more Marvel and DC superheroes on TV or in the theater. But the preview of Episode 1 of Watchmen looked intriguing, and I gave it a try.<br/><br/>Holy cow! Within 15 min. of watching Ep 1, I knew that I would love this, and that was indeed the case. The entire 9 episodes make for a wild, WILD ride, way out there on so many levels. I have zero doubt that as a non-expert in Watchmen, I missed a bunch of things or certain references simply went over my head and I didn't even realize it. But it didn't stop me from enjoying this. I'll probably watch it again at some point, simply because there was so much to take in. As to the so-called "political" undercurrent of the series that is referenced in a number of prior Amazon reviews, frankly it didn't even occur to me as I was watching it, and I think people are reading way more in to it than is the case. It's entertainment, folks! You know what I was thinking while watching some of the scenes? "Wow, I wonder what the production budget was for this series, because it certainly does look like an expensive production".<br/><br/>I have no idea whether HBO plans on bringing this back for another season, or whether this was it. Certainly the very last episode felt like it didn't resolve a number of the side stories that emerged over these 9 episodes. And the very last scene leaves the door wide open... Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this. Excellent allegory of the effect white supremacy, nationalism and racism has had and continues to have on this country, and on people of color. Directly addresses the trauma people experience living in a racist society. Serious stuff. I've never seen a show get so much hate before. This show is great and all I see is people talking smack and making a big deal because what the lead actress is black and deals with racism? Ummm welcome to the world, these things exist. This show is very well made and I enjoy it. As a white male I have no problem with the story and will continue to recommend it to my friends. Through the first three episodes, the pacing has been outstanding. The acting is superb and the writing is brilliant. Whoever took the Watchmen into this direction is a fan of the comics. I see the comments section is full of salty incels that didn't read the graphic novel nor do they know much about Alan Moore.<br/><br/>Don't listen to these trolls. The show is great. Some of it will be confusing if you never read the graphic novel. You could cheat by watching the movie but even that doesn't get some things right. The pilot set the scene in a jarring and edgy way on a lot of levels and I would agree very different from the original lore.... but not so different that what's happening now couldn't be possible. I think there are people really missing the point of what the message was. I don't recall anywhere in the pilot saying white people are bad but rather that white supremecy is bad. If white supremecy being bad makes you uncomfortable then I would say you made need to take a second and really think about why that makes you uncomfortable. I don't believe Rorschach would've approved... But it's not unrealistic that an honorable cause could be bent by someone bad to turn it into an evil agenda.<br/><br/>That bring said, I'm going to keep myself out of the political gutter for now and go along for the ride. I'm looking forward to the next episode but I'm hoping we start to get more backstory and it better be good backstory. I'm not one for shock value so if that's all this show will be then my interest won't last long. Marvellous and Incredible cant wait for season 2! Life is political I've never seen people calling war films political or homeland too political..... Godawful utter crap without any connection to the source material.
Why, why, why?
Zack Snyder's take on the material may have its flaws but is lightyears ahead.
Had to watch "Birth of a Nation" & a few instalments of "Amos & Andy" immediately afterwards, just to get another perspective... Each episode a pure pleasure. Each episode felt like a movie. Just amazing.
I am happy I finished because now I can start again. Lideloff nailed it with this one. Such a fantastic show!! Very refreshing and great acting. Highly recommend! HBO's Watchmen is definitely the most beautiful,mysterious and beyond amazing TV show ever made.Sorry Game of Thrones but no matter how much seasons GOT has,Watchmen almost beat the entire GOT series with just one season.Thank you Damon Lindelof,you gave us the best Watchmen sequel ever,no other comic book/movie sequel to Watchmen will do what you did.
I honestly don't understand why some of the audience/fans thinks that the show is garbage or that it is just ok,this is the only time when the movie critics have a better opinion than some of the audience.
I also hope that HBO won't get too rush of making another season for Watchmen because right now,having just this one season is perfect.Maybe after some time,if Damon Lindelof will still be part of the project,I would like to see a season 2 of this magnificient pice of art called Watchmen,by the way the ending is beautiful and is almost just like the one from Joker 2019. For the first couple of episodes you could be forgiven for wondering what this has to do with Watchmen. But this sequel actually manages to add something interesting and well told to the canonical story.
The only character that doesn't quite ring true is Adrian Veight but after years of living with the consequences of his previous plan maybe it does make sense. I just finished the first season, if you are not the easily offended (KKK bigot) kind, you'll love this show. It's deep and emotional, and perfectly suits with the original graphic novel. A great sequel, very high above the usual super hero stuff. 9/10 I'm from Tulsa. I've never read the comics, but I did see the movie. This show nails it, not only the story, but also the location. I guess a lot of people don't know about the Tulsa Race Riot, but this shows it exactly as it happened. Really really well done. I enjoyed the first episode, it was really good, the second was unwatchable. I stopped watching by now.. bye hbo, i guess I've heard a lot of people saying that this isn't true to the source material. I disagree, this is an extension of the source material. The graphic novel mentions the Red Scare, the news stand is in a graphic novel that was put out after the movie. So all in all it does stay in line with the true source material.<br/><br/>Great performances so far, great look on the show. Second episode is better than the first and that is a great sign. Give out a shout outs a good show. Anyone that says the show is too political never read the comic book . In fact, the end of episode 1 was a nod to the death of the Comedian. So if anyone's criticism is that it's not like the comic, they're lying and have another agenda in mind. The HBO series is shot like the Wire. A lot going on in a relatively small space (at least so far). Not rangy like GOT, Boardwalk or Silicon Valley. Very well acted and the story line has what I am looking for in a series. It lets you know up front that there is something big going on. So you have to pay attention to the little things. However, the show is living on the edge and it could wind up like Lost. But as of right now it's damn good! From the cast to the crew you can tell this show was well made and thought out. It's a piece of art. Regina King! OMG! Girl Got It Going On! Her character, Angela Abar, is a kickass heroine with rough edges. From her priestly cloaked garb to her sleek black muscle car, this lady is a force to be reckoned with. I dig it! I have to admit, I do have to see each episode twice to get a clear picture as to what's going on. I would have never even tried if it had not been for Regina Kings performance. Thank you Ms. King! You Go Girl! Disclaimer first: The following lines contain massive spoilers. I am not an American, so I am not familiar with all the current headlines in the States. I am only three episodes in and I would consider myself on the conservative side of the political spectrum. And I still love it.<br/><br/>After literally every show I watched during the past months was about race issues in general and the situation of PoC in the USA in particular, all told from a very liberal point of view, my first reaction after was "Oh no, not again." But boy, was I wrong. Instead of being your typical "woke" show, this is far more intelligent. It's "The Liberals won big time and they created a dystopia."<br/><br/>A very liberal president has been reigning supreme for decades. People of Color are enjoying massive amounts of positive discrimination. So black businesses are striving, while many white household are sliding into poverty and living in gigantic caricatures of a trailer park. Even some light evening entertainment can only be shown with a massive Disclaimer at the beginning, so that really NO ONE may ever feel offended. There is even the fear of technology (that is probably more a trademark o the European left, I presume.) A political landscape like this of course lead to an ever increasing fragmentation of society and paving the way for political radicalization. So the white supremacists are not only still there, they are growing in numbers, violence and level of organisation. They are still without a doubt the villains, but they are also the expected side effect if you push a democratic society this far to the left.<br/><br/>But it doesn't stop there. In order to prevent police officers from shooting People of Color, they created situation for the cops that can only be described of schizophrenic. Now police officers have to go through a tedious authorization process in order to use their guns. Now less PoC are being shot, but (black) police officers have no way of defending themselves against gun violence.<br/><br/>On the other had the Cops (at least in Oklahoma) are now acting completely anonymous, so they can freely go Dirty Harry on anyone the deem a suspect. A whole town of white trash is rounded and beaten up violently by self-righteous cops because being white AND poor at the same time is enough to be deemed a possible terrorist. Since racism is the only thing the cops are concerned about, suspects are then dragged into a Black Site where they have suffer through questionable a mind game. A cop with a hideous mask tries to elicit any kind of hidden prejudices. If he is successful, the suspect is in for another beating. Bo being suspected racist (e.g. being white and poor) is enough that your citizen's rights are void.<br/><br/>Yes, this series does raise awareness about racial issues in past and present. But it is also quiet intelligent and maybe the first show I have seen that does talk about contemporary political issues while still managing to not force-feed you a strictly liberal agenda since, well, The Good Wife. The only thing "woke" about this show is that it has a diverse cast and a strong black female lead, which all makes sense in the context of the story it is going to tell. If THAT is your issue in 2019, then yes, you are one. If not, give it a try. Don't listen to the negative reviews, I love the source material. I thought the film was not bad.<br/><br/>The series has blown me away. Having just watched the final episode I can say hands down that's the best thing I've seen on TV in a long time.<br/><br/>Watched it with my parter who knows nothing of Watchmen and she loved it too. Knowing the source material helps pull out all the little nods and Easter eggs and certainly helps furnish the story but is not required.<br/><br/>No idea how or why this got so many negative reviews. The way each episode focuses on the narrative from a slightly different point of view, never quite giving you all of the story and then to wrap it up and bring it all together at the end was gripping throughout. Can not recommend this highly enough. Can't wait to rewatch knowing the ending and see what hints I missed along the way. Compulsive viewing. I see a lot of people rushing to rate this show after only one episode and not giving the story a chance to develop.<br/><br/>I've just binged 5 episodes today and I'm hooked.<br/><br/>The series takes place a few decades after the film and includes several characters from the movie.<br/><br/>Give it a chance! This is very much the watchmen but closer to present day. 'Very binge worthy' I have not read the comics and i don't care about people being woke or deep asleep.<br/><br/>This show and unfortunately some other shows that came out recently have reduced storytelling to 5 lines of actual story in each episode and filling the rest with mysterious music, good cinematography and actors running around doing stuff for no good reason in sight. 7 episodes in and a total of 15 minutes Substance been given to us, this whole thing could be a 85 minutes tv movie.<br/><br/>I don't know if they've done Their research and found out nowadays people don't really care that much as long as it looks good or its just a big mistake. Either way it seems like its going to be happening a lot by the quality of the new shows and not just from HBO. I can see where a lot of the initial criticism is coming from as the first couple episodes I was pretty lost with the tone and direction of the show and it kind of jumps right in without letting itself slowly build. But now with a few episodes of backstory and tying different elements together, the show is finally making sense and it really is something else. To be fair I am not well-versed in the original comics and I felt like Snyder's film tried to paint it as something else, but here we get all the elements tied into one with fresh new stories. It isn't about superheroes and fighting crime, it's about the core flaws of human beings, the relationships we have with each other, and the same political messes regardless of our history or past events. To the people saying it's "woke" is nonsense, it's showing us a new reality but with all the same problems we're facing now, allowing you to escape but at the same time remind you of the storm that is our present day. I think the team behind this is setting up an entire universe to explore without giving up too much right away. I'm intrigued and just want all answers to everything but love how it's taking it's time. Give yourself the chance to embrace the randomness that is the Watchmen universe and enjoy the moments of heartbreak, vengeance, humour, and stunning visuals that bring everything together! tick tock tick tock.... Here's the thing, whether you k ow the source material, or are aware that this show takes place 30 years AFTER the events in the graphic novel (not the film) and how those events affected an alternate reality/history than our own ( although the Tulsa massacre is an actual historic event that DID happen, and is simply amplified in this alternate world ), all of that aside, crying 'woke' or too political against a show titled 'Watchmen' is ridiculous. You clearly didn't read or get the source material. It's incredibly political and satirical. It was woke before woke was a social verbal term. Now to rate this show based on that is just wrong. Second, to rate a show, saying it has an 'agenda' without seeing where the plot or storyline even goes throughout the season is also juvenile. If you know the source material, again you'd know it pits all sides against itself. It asks questions to all political stances. It doesn't lean any one way, and although at times it seems it does, as it unfolds you see the changing views and messages. Obviously a story arc like that can't be carried out in one or even a few episodes. You have to stick it out and see where it goes and maybe then you can have an actual opinion on if it is slanted or not. As for right now, who knows what the message is. I'm sure there will be some twists. I'm rating the show a 7 at the moment for all the detail out into the evolved world after the graphic novel. The affect it made on this alt-world and the numerous Easter eggs regarding the original book. The story within a story is yet another reoccurring layer, that will no doubt mirror the overall arc. I'm also rating it for it's superb production design, casting, acting and score. As to whether I'll love the final product, who knows. But this is my 2 episode in review, not some raving knee reaction without giving proper viewing and response time and with actually knowing the source material very well and where THIS new instalment fits into it all. I had previously seen the film and read some of the comics many years ago but this, I really do not know what to make of this. It's not the easiest of stories to follow imo but it is fascinating, strange and in a way compelling. I'm going to wait until I have seen them all before posting a more in depth review. I was really stoked about this show but sadly i was disappointed. it's not even about the watchmen; they just slapped the title on there for attention. HBO is doing it again, they think everyone in America is a liberal socialist. They ruined yet again another great film/comic. I will not continue to waste my hard earned time watching another political vehicle that is liberal. Can't you just take the middle ground so all Americans can enjoy their precious time off for an hour or two? At least create a few shows that have a conservative tone to satisfy at least the other 50% of Americans.<br/><br/>Save your time and ignore this reimagined crap .. better yet dump HBO altogether and save your money or give it to a worthy charity of your choice. If it was the same as the Comics or Movie, the same doom mongers on here would be up in arms because of the lack of originality.<br/><br/>My only negative is that I'd have like the Don Johnson character to have been explored more in the following episodes. Please do not listen to the hate. The series is not a recreation of the book, but a future envisioned 30 years later in the aftermath. I find it refreshing - thoroughly thought out and engaging. Thankfully, the writing and scenes steers away from the clichÃ© tropes, on-the-nose writing, wooden acting, and shoehorning that the movie provided. The series also stays true to canon, even though the movie did not. Open your mind, allow the story to unfold and you'll notice all the well placed clues that harken to the book, and original characters. These writers don't treat the audience like idiots and unfold everything for you. We're only 3 episodes deep, but Regina King and Jean Smart are great leads, and so far the show is fantastically well written. Even if you don't agree with my sentiments, watch it and don't let the trolls sway you in forming your own opinion! Wow really did justice to this series. in all ramification I will rate this series +10 The opening scene of this Watchmen series was a pretty epic depiction of a horrific event that took place about a century ago. I'd been to where that happened many times before but this really brought it to life and set the scene for where this series will go. Plenty of action and plot to follow. More than enough breadcrumbs dropped in this first episode to make sure I want to follow. Really impressed with it so far. I have always liked Louis Gossett, Jeremy Irons, Jean Smart and Tim Blake Nelson, and all four are great in this program. The entire cast is wonderful, especially Regina King as the central character Sister Night (Angela), Hong Chau as the mysterious Lady Trieu, the veteran Don Johnson and the very gifted Yahoo Abdul-Mateen as Angela's devoted husband Cal. The story takes us into a plot that evolves out of a little-known real genocidal incident of African-Americans on the "Black Wall Street" in Tulsa in 1921. The story is told through the eyes of an orphaned boy whose experience goes into his later suffering at the hands of white supremacists in the 40s, 50s and beyond. The exploration of white privilege in American society is told through an action story, and not through didactic preaching. The evil of the antagonists is skillfully displayed in a way that plays on our awareness of our own violent natures as Homo sapiens. This is an excellent limited series, and I highly recommend it to those who are looking for a different experience of the comic book genre. I thought the show was brilliant. Maybe a lot of people disliked it because they had a preconceived notion of what it should be. I believe it stands on its own, as a companion to the original novel and as an original show in its own right. After watching the first episode I didn't follow up for a couple of weeks as I thought I was slightly dull and wasn't sure I wanted to commit 12-odd hours of my life to it. Finally sat down with episode 2 and started to be gripped, but even then I had no idea how powerful it would get with the commentary on overt and hidden racism, or indeed how bonkers the story would get with its twisting and turning like a twisty turny thing! I could have said timey wimey as well, but too many cultural TV and movie references makes Jack a dull boy! Roll on season 2! Ratings on IMDB were so bad when the show came out that I didn't even consider watching it. After a while, lots of contradictory reviews came up and it was clearly some sort of biases coming from many users. I watched all 9 episodes and I am not disappointed, this is the best show this year and by far. The story is really good and in line with the previous movie, acting and direction is good. This is definitely watchmen! But hey this is a fiction right? No need to take it personally and get upset because you have a different political agenda. Just give it a shot, it's an amazing show. Many shows have tried to switch roles of history, consider alternate realities. To see 'WHAT IF...!' We all know or can read about the history of the world. The racial tensions and the political mishaps. This isn't an American problem but a world issue. If you believe Racism doesn't exist in your neighbourhood then you are naive.
a
The watchmen historically addressed the dark side of realities, humanity, including the Racial tensions.
The comic book and movie did address these issues in a bigger picture. The series has decided to start after events of the movie and so will develop characters, plots and subplots, with new characters and alternate story. (Otherwise like all comic book adaptations, it would have been a boring rehash of what we know and are familiar with).<br/><br/>This Series similar to 'The Man in the high castle' switched roles on us (what if the Germans had won the Great War). In the Watchmen - An alternate world where coloured people are in power (police) and white are the minority, seems an idea to explore.<br/><br/>In addition it's a comic book story platform - Fiction Aimed to get us to think. As the world still has not learned from mistakes of our ancestors.<br/><br/>We should all appreciate the positive and negative reviews. It's important and is the main point 'We all have a voice", whether we like it or not, everyone is allowed to voice an opinion. This is my first ever review on here. I felt like I had to say something in response to all the people "hating" on this show. Also I'm not a native english speaker, in case of grammatical errors.<br/><br/>My initial thought of the show after just one episode was that I thought it was weird. I didn't quite understand what was going on and I didn't fully get why it was branded as watchmen. Yes they had the masks, the squids and dr. Manhattan. But other than that it felt off. However as the show has progressed, now at 5 episodes, I totally see what it's going for.<br/><br/>This is a sequal, and a very relevant one at that. Watchmen is a political and societal commentary, so it's obvious why they choose to tell the story like this. There's a lot of things in the mix. Racism, corruption and fraud, terrorism, police brutality, the idea of a perfectly equal society etc.<br/><br/>People have complained that this show is trying so hard to adhere to "wokeness" and pc culture. But they've got it all wrong. I shouldn't call it subtext because the show is clearly trying to tell you that the building stones of the "perfect" society that the characters are living in is based on lies and deception. All it is is a game of power, played by very powerful people.<br/><br/>Consequentialism is a big theme here. If your goal is pure, does it really matter how you achieved it? The show is trying to tell you that it's complicated. That a necessary evil might be logical but also moraly wrong. That nothing is as simple as black and white. That much of everything you think is true might be a lie, a facade. People are caught in the crossfire no matter what. And sooner or later something seemingly pure and innocent might collapse because it's all built on a giant squid carcass.<br/><br/>I'd like to add that the writing, acting, story and cinematography is top notch. Go watch this show, just don't judge it too much until you've seen all the episodes. It's a puzzle, but with time you'll get the necessary pieces. I've seen 4 episodes and while first two are a bit slow, it gets more interesting with each following episode.<br/><br/>Yes, this of course is not a recreation of the comics but rather set in the same world and events of the comics are set in the past.<br/><br/>I agree that the racism thingy does not hit home with international audience and is probably the reason why people are giving it the negative reviews, but I did not find it to be a problem. At least if you start watching without any expectations and with an open mind. Remember that the Watchmen have their own universe that is different to ours. Cornerstone events happened differently than in our history.<br/><br/>The production quality is very good, the acting is great and the characters are getting more interesting (quite a lot of grey areas) with each new episode.<br/><br/>Based on first few episodes I am giving it a solid 9 I really had some Hope in this.Just a disappointment can't go above 2 episodes. I need to give this a 10 to counter the one stars!<br/><br/>I do not know the comics and therefore I can look at it from a different view. One star is just trolling. Even if you don't like where the story is going you got to at least give 2 stars for the acting. 1 star for style and one star for the way they tell the story. Even if you don't like the content, it's told beautifully.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the original movie, a lot. So far i'm really enjoying this show even more. People shouting PC culture are not watching the same show as i'm watching.<br/><br/>Watch this and enjoy the ride! 8/10 DC is going big in TV, movies and Animation-comic. Im giving a 7 since i loved. The landscape is amazing and snip for history is eye opener. After 3 episode im enjoying it. Give it q try. This Was Different To The Movie But In a Good Way Enjoyed The First Episode First Rate Cast :)) Can't Wait To Watch How The Story Plays Out :)) Ignore The Negative Reviews !!!!! First i have to declare two things:
1) i've not read the comics
2) i've seen the film<br/><br/>That in mind i've expected something similiar, but i got something else.
I loved the film! and first i hoped to see something similiar, but now i'm glad they didn't.<br/><br/>The series is set in a sinister period of time where we live in, but the past has changed it in a world apart from ours. We see that the police is now the guardian of the people, but masked and dressed as vigilantes to protect themselves and their family. The pilot tells slowly why that is the case.<br/><br/>Yes it has political and social problems we encouter today and it is to give a thougth of where do i stand? Is it all black and white? Is there a grey area?<br/><br/>And then the thing i mostly love that it is easy to watch! Great acting, great cinematography, great story and ambiance!<br/><br/>I just love it and can't wait to the second epsiode! As someone that read the graphic novel and saw the movie. I feel the same about the TV show as I feel about the movie...... It's just ok... nothing overwhelming awesome. I see the nods and call backs to the graphic novel but I have no connection to these characters so far and to me I think it should grab you in the first episode. I can't think of a better show. Watchmen has so much depth - the story, the characters, the sets, the costumes, FX - all superb. I get tired or annoyed with most superhero shows after a handful of episodes but Watchmen delivers through and through. Very artistic and entertaining, memorable and funny all in one. I never read the book and I didn't know the story before so it is all fresh for me. This show is worth my precious time. It does help if you lean towards progressive on issues of race and gender. I'm writing this review to encourage anyone on the fence from giving this show a try, and to praise the people who made Watchmen. Keep it up! Never read the comics associated with this show. Watched the movie and liked it a lot. Have and would watch it again. This series? I am not getting good vibes from it. It is going for offbeat, something I generally like. In parts there is a lot of violence, which doesn't bother me. Unless it is used to cover up the boring and I think that is the case here.<br/><br/>Main problem is I find it really hard to understand why the good guys are good and the bad guys bad. I get the impression they are going to flip that and think they are cool.<br/><br/>Still, I am going to watch Ep2. My rating begins at 5 and I will raise or lower depending on how it goes.<br/><br/>(For comparison, I would give the movie a 8, maybe 9) This show is important. Already, so many people are learning about the massacre that many people don't know about.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the show is spectacularly well-done. The story is engaging, the performances are wonderful, and the cinematography, design, and music are all fantastic.<br/><br/>Don't listen to these  reviews. They just can't understand a world changing around them which Watchmen shows us in incredible detail. This show has a lot going for it, amazing storytelling, directing, cinematography, score, acting etc. Show creator Damon Lindelof (co-creator of Lost and The Leftovers) is one of the best in my opinion and this show is perfect for him. Trent Reznor(NIN) does the score which fits the show nicely as well. The cast is very good as well lead by the brilliant Regina King who is kick ass in this role.
Like most HBO shows it has the feel of a movie. The special effects are the best you'll see in any TV show, the sets are out of control, one of my favorite parts is the costumes.
Watchmen is very relevant to what's going on in our world ,especially relevant to how things are in the US past and unfortunately present...which explains the huge amount of Troll reviews on IMDB and sadly they make in some cases dozens of accounts to rate it a 1/10 or the like. These trolls even review episodes before they're even on the air.
Do yourself a favor and make up your own mind by giving the pilot a watch (the show takes off right away ,don't need 3 or 4 episodes to get what's going on and you won't need to read Watchmen or see the movie before checking out the show. I wasn't sure exactly what direction things were going in until episode 2 which is even better than the pilot. How anyone, whether fans of the original graphic novel or novices to the source material, could have a negative opinion after just 2 episodes is ridiculous and disingenuous. I come from that first group and think the show has thus far been true to the graphic novel. It seems like the critics that are fans of the graphic novels don't realize this story takes place decades after the source material. Most of those characters are either dead or as old as Lou Gossett Jr. I'm guessing people were expecting a retelling of the graphic novel and are upset that it's not the case. We still have yet to learn Oxymandias' role is in the series, Judd's true self before his death, or whether or not the Kavalry is really behind the White Night and Judd's murder, etc. Hey, if you want to bail on the show after 2 episodes then go right ahead. There are plenty of us that will hang in there for all 9 episodes to see where this is going, because I get the feeling that thing aren't what they seem. I assumed before looking that this show would get a high score on IMDB and was shocked to see that it was only on the quite good level of just over 7/10. This absolutely mystified me as this show has been written with such care and depth. You have more going on in the set scenery than some shows do in an entire episode. The acting has been top notch and so have the scripts. Anyone who has read the book (I read them when they came out as monthly comics back in the 80s or seen the film (and is aware of the different ending in the book) would see that this is a worthy add on to the Watchmen world. I am convinced that even Alan Moore if he could let go of his hatred of all things to do with adapting his work would appreciate the depth and cleverness of this show. Having now read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews it has become pretty obvious that the issue is with a segment of the public that sees them self in this show but portrayed as the bad guys. I have news for you. You are the bad guys. No amount of playing the victim and calling people and banging on about woke culture will change that. Who is good, who is bad? The hero(s) are as ruthless as the baddies, I love it, not sure why people have been so negative? Simply the best; can't wait to see season finale
Actors all are stellar and are totally believable The series has a very mixed beginning but it still has the watchmen feeling in it. I love the movie. The darkness and the way that it doesn't feel like a comic book-movie. Comic book-movies always has the good guy and the bad guy but the movie will make you think, who is the good guy. That what the series also make.<br/><br/>The way that the series is made, is that it will not answer all of the questions. The way that the camera moves doesn't answer all of the questions. This is a very well shot and made series.<br/><br/>Also Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross has made a masterful music to the series. This music I will listen too many times.<br/><br/>Great series, great acting, great camera work, great plot, great music and great, great, great! I will watch the series to the end. The show's been built up quite a bit in the media leading up to this, so I just expected a bit more oomph from the first episode. I probably would've kept watching it anyway because I've watched worse shows for a less reward.<br/><br/>But honestly, seeing all the white crybabies clutching their pearls in the other reviews is placing the show on my permanent watchlist. I barely remember Watchmen the movie and i didnt read comics.
This show is incredibly well produced.
Story so far is full of mystery and unconnected dots.
It is fun, it is superbly done and absolute blast to watch.
I really hope all the plot stuff connects nicely since i cant really form an opinion so far without seeing full picture. Definetely recommended to anyone since its probably one of the better done tv series i watched in a while. While the show as it states is a total reimagining of the world Alan Moore created, Episode 1 continues the idea of who watches the Watchmen, and who do you really trust in terms of world leaders and authority figures. Looking to whether we go to violence or other means. Show depicts what the morals of the Watchmen is about Not what I expected but it left me wanting more. Yes I am an Alan Moore fan. Yes I loved the graphic novel AND the movie. Love the way the episode was directed. Love the music. Don't understand what's going on but definitely want to find out! Part of the mystery / fun ;) I never read the book, or is it a comic. don't like action hero movies.<br/><br/>I am not this shows audience. for some especially under 12, this might be a show for you. I actually like SciFi - but not this one.<br/><br/>And I do not like Jean Smart. She is an annoying actress. meaning I am annoyed when I watch her Please please just listen. This show is a masterpiece I even have it ranked higher the mandalorian. The stupid reviews that you see from people is because they are hooked on the comic. And we're expecting that. So they left one out of 10 based off of the first few episodes. I promise you once you get to say the 4th episode you will be hooked. This is easily one of the best superhero shows I've ever seen and the most different concept I've seen. Watch it you won't regret it Headline says it all, but it's one of the most entertaining pieces of film/TV/whatever I've ever witnessed. Hope there's a season two but even if there isn't, in fine with it!!! Every episode filmic and expertly crafted. The acting and casting completely spot on. Terrific poignant story with a deep emotional anchor, that's as timely as it is essential.
Long story short: racists deserve heat laser death. P.S. Regina King needs all the awards. This is it. This is a show. Absolutely beautiful, stunning, magnificent. I am running out of words for this. Incredible. Season started a little slow then picked up in each subsequent episode. Storytelling is coherent and nothing seems out of place. It's really easy to follow. If you don't have background about what watchmen even then the show won't let you be confused if you could just give yourself enough time and don't give up after just one episode. I didn't read any comics but I understood what's going on and in curiosity read a few articles about original watchmen. Even if I didn't I wouldn't be missing much as each episode tells us about the past anyway.<br/><br/>I feel like after watching a black woman as protagonist and a bunch of white people as antagonist, people got triggered as usually it's opposite way around they are used to.<br/><br/>Rating a show based on your biased worldview instead of its story, cinematography, acting etc is just plain ridiculous and utterly stupid.<br/><br/>If you have read the whole comment then in your free time watch a couple of episode and decide for yourself. Don't let vocal minority cloud your judgement as to what you should enjoy and what not. The premise here is that it's AFTER watchman, and Roeschach's journal has apparently reached its destination. I like how it shows and doesn't tell what is different in this world, and the world building thus gar is first rate. Sure, you either lije or hate the whole supers thing. I think it's great stuff thus far and I don't get the 1-point reviews at all. At the very least it is solid entertainment. Good show so far, two episodes in. I will come back and honestly adjust my review and rating as it goes.... i wish everyone else would as well.... sad world we live in! This show is so confusingly misleading. I came in expecting a more in depth adaptation of the original graphic novel. The movie was great but due to the limited runtime things had to be cut so I figured the show would fill in where it did not.<br/><br/>The entire first episode I found myself confused as to whether this was a sequel or something entirely different. Nothing was explained leaving fans looking for something to grasp onto. The only thing I was able to grasp was that this did not even feel like an HBO series,<br/><br/>I am sure you could enjoy this if you never saw the movie or read the graphic novel but if you are looking for an adaptation then just save yourself the time. I've watched the first and second episode. It is another HBO script depicting white people as racist etc... They took the great comic book series and the 2009 movie fans and lured them into watching this social brainwashing. The actors do a great job in their character, however the script is ugly. They are taking a fictional story and mixing in historical facts in order to continue pushing the same old tired agenda. I don't see anything great about the script. Show me two morons from a coastal state making out for an hour and it's an 8 on here but something cerebral, no thanks. Ridiculous. This show, if it continues to be anything like the pilot, might be the best thing on tv this year (or last). Just weird enough to make your brow furrow but a solid enough story to keep you drilling for more. Fantastic. Can't wait for the rest of this season to drop. I feel that most of the reviewers here are suffering from "instant gratification anxiety". I like the style and the development of the story. And judging from the previews for next episodes, it looks like it's going to be an exciting series. Watchmen (2019) has stunning levels of detail, foreshadowing and tie-ins... if you pay close attention and either know the reference material or watch YouTube videos analyzing each episode. The writers and director get 11 stars for the level of detail.<br/><br/>However, if you are a casual HBO subscriber who used to watch GoT or other series - you will struggle to get what it's all about. It's not for everyone, but it's damn great. Don't judge one or even two episodes in. There's obviously more going on with the plot than modern day political statements.<br/><br/>Long story short, so far it's entertaining, and there's a ton of mystery and deception going on. They're just building the world for us before everything is clear. We don't need to keep comparing just two episodes to the source material or the movie.<br/><br/>I'm a time where most shows are incredibly predictable are just simple reboots of things from the past, I'm cautiously optimistic about this, since I'm two episodes in and I have no idea yet if this is all smoke and mirrors. There are some wonderful scenes in this, well acted, scripted and shot. Then it all gets undone with tedium. Sometimes its so overly self aware about exposition it makes a massive point about it... then does it anyway.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are heavy handed and overused as a way of reminding you a certain character feels a certain way, plot twists are drawn out over several episodes and ultimately feel underwhelming.<br/><br/>Then there are storylines that are just ridiculous that crop up and disappear almost at random, but I suppose to keep you interested.<br/><br/>It could have been so much better but its as if there was a big ideas for scenes session then they just connected them without much thought.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the film (I know thats controversial with some Watchmen fans but whatevs its all perosonal opinion anyway), and i was really looking forwards to this but ended up eye-rolling so much i nearly gave myself a headache For starters, I haven't yet forgiven Lindelhof for LOST or Prometheus. He's on my {profane} list just like M. Night after Last Airbender. Also, I've only liked one Zack Snyder film, and that was 300. So the 2009 movie had no impact on my perspective.<br/><br/>The behavior of certain people in power over race was jarring, but reasonably accurate for the time period (I understand that this is an alternate universe). In the American south, including Texas and Georgia, I have first hand experience observing abhorrent behavior towards people of another race. Same in California and Arizona. It's not everyone, and it's not all the time, but it still happens and it's unjust. In the 1930s and 1940s, it was more pronounced. Go read Huck Finn if you're unconvinced. It's not a conspiracy, and there's no such thing as the liberal agenda.<br/><br/>Now, the script was not a dumpster fire like I had originally worried it would be. The main characters were solid, and Regina King was amazing. I don't know much about the world of the Watchmen, so I simply took each episode as it came. I thought the generational piece n the last few episodes was interesting, and was mesmerized by the blue guy talking to a girl in a bar, experiencing all of time at once. It took a little longer than it should have to start tying connections together in the story, but hey - LOST, amirite?<br/><br/>I went to check when the next season was coming out, only to learn it was a miniseries. That ending was pretty inconclusive. Anyway, not a bad way to spend a Saturday. 4/5 stars. What an incredible journey! This is a modern take on the classic comics that is set in a world that no longer has superheroes. The cops are now the masked crusaders yet the villains also wear masks and as the season goes on the blind blurs between good and bad. People are only giving bad reviews because they can't stand to look at the history and Evil in bedded in white American history. The story starts off with a flashback to The Tulsa race riots of 1921 (which actually happened in real life) which is the back bone to the majority of events that happen through out the season. When shows like this show the brutality and lack of humanity that happened during this time people either applaud its honesty or bury their heads in the sand and call it "woke". How many world war films do we have? No one calls them woke or liberal. But as soon as you make a show with a black lead that apologetically shows the horror of white America they can't stand it. Watch the show the characters are great, The cinematography, the writing everything about the show is top notch. You'll be left wanting more really hoping for a second season! I've ranted about this show to so many people about so many different aspects of it. But the tldr is: this show is the best of the year hands down, it's only competition is Chernobyl (and to be fair the competition is close).<br/><br/>There was not one thing I didn't love about this show, but I will try to be concise and just discuss our favorites.<br/><br/>Like the original Watchmen this series is the perfect work for our time, it's commentary and fun house mirror look at modern racial tensions in America feel every bit as poignant as Alan Moore's take on the cold war when he published his work in 86. Hell they even come out and say it for people who might not have gotten it in the episode where Senator Keene says something along the lines of "being a white man is too hard, I think I'll become a blue one." Also the reveal of Will Reeves as the original vigilante Hooded Justice both made something click based on his costumes iconography, and was probably one of the best episodes of TV since Breaking Bad's Ozymandius.<br/><br/>Though my favorite thing about the show might be it's use of music. Visually the show paid lots of homage to Dave Gibbons' work in the graphic novel, from costume design, the use of Ozymandius' original costume, to the paintings on Laura's wall that (besides Ozymandius' mask) could have been stolen right from the pages of Watchmen. However the music paid homage to Zack Snyder's 2009 adaptation of the graphic novel. The instances where it sticks out to me the most is when in the first episode we hear Nat King Cole's unforgettable playing in the background right before Judd's murder, the inciting incident of the show that mirrors the Comedian's murder in the graphic novel. The second is the use of Requiem in D minor in episode 7, when Doctor Manhattan was being discussed, is the same piece Snyder's movie used for the character.<br/><br/>Finally being able to return to the world of my favorite fictional work of all time was an absolute blast. Especially with little details like all the cars being electric (as in the graphic novel Dr. Manhattan was able to create enough lithium to make electric cars commercially viable in the 70's) to a wonderful recreation of the NYC alien attack that until now has only existed in comic book form, was an absolute delight.<br/><br/>This show not only helps me solidify Watchmen being my all time favorite piece of fiction ever created, (now that designation includes the TV show) but shows that it will forever exist at least on the fringes of the cultures zeitgeist, and had made a lasting impact on American Culture outside the realm of comics, as all the buzz this show generated could not have been coming from just readers of Moore and Gibbons' original work.<br/><br/>This I feel like is one of the must watch shows of the year and I cannot wait to see it dissected with the same vigor as the graphic novel has been for decades to come.<br/><br/>Just please don't ruin it with a sequel. One of the more brilliant, imaginative shows I've seen. It is a very fascinating out-of-the-box take on historical, contemporary, and sci-fi storytelling. Definitely, worth watching a second time to pick up on dialogue, introduction of characters, and characters' motivations which seemed slight the first time. On top of all this, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create the original music (3 volume soundtrack) and Liza Richardson is the music supervisor. If you are not into white supremacists being villians this may not be the show for you. Most of the reviewers who have given it lower stars than 7(yes 7) are the ones who just watched the first 2 or three episodes. If u don't trust me then check their reviews. This show is brilliant and although the issues are somewhat political but it is so because it imagines an era where America does not go through chnages it did. Although some people may say it is slow and stuff. Don't listen. It takes to build it's mystery and suspense which pays off and gives us one of the best twists of new tv era. It's actually better than the movie. It gets the comics and covers its essence. The story shows how far humanity has fallen but still finds hope even though their god has abandoned them. It keeps the good parts of the movie and rejects the bad ones. Come on guys we have grown up in the era south park. How can we be offended so easily. Give it a chance and I assure you it won't disappoint you. This is an imaginative show with a stylish vision of its own which stays true to itself in spite of what comic-fan expectations might be demanding of it.
As of episode seven, my only reservation about the show is that none of the characters are really likeable, which makes it fail somewhat in comparison to other unique offerings such as Doom Patrol and The Boys.
I like the fact that it's daring, that tremendous thought has gone into it, and that it incorporates allegories for very important sociopolitical issues. If you're offended by any of that, you're probably on the wrong side of the argument.
Some of the complaints on these boards are predictably pitiful:
Complaints that white supremacists are the bad guys.
In what depraved universe could white supremacists not be the bad guys? But white supremacists are only the tiniest percentage of the white population, so only Nazis need take offence. And who cares if they do? Not this white guy.
Complaints that all the leads are women.
It only matters that the characters have integrity, are well-written, and are not a ridiculous, impossible cartoon catering to a fantasy in which ninety-pound girls who are as thin as twigs beat up platoons of marines without smudging their lipstick. The female characters in Watchmen do not fall into this dumbed-down category. This show is a million miles away from Charlie's Angels or Batwoman.
Complaints that blacks are trying to make whites feel ashamed.
There's no need to feel ashamed of what your forebears did, as long as you're not carrying on their morally-bankrupt mission. But the atrocities of history need to be depicted for modern audiences, acknowledged and learned from. If it makes you feel uncomfortable that your grandparents had a poisonous world view and acted on it, then good. Let's hope their example has made you part of a better generation.
Complaints that it's not like the comic.
There seem to be mixed opinions on this, but as this is supposed to be a far-removed sequel using the original, much earlier story as a jumping-off point, then I don't see that this criticism is even relevant. But if you want something that's exactly like the comic, then read the comic. It really hits on so many issues that society is currently facing. I am a little concerned that it is going to get too far out there to even track as it has begun getting somewhat abstract even within the first few episodes, but I am hoping it continues on strong! Anyone who is complaining about this show is probably doing it for a wrong reason. There are some people who will always get offended for portraying white supremacists as bad guys.<br/><br/>BTW original Watchmen were heavily political too, but it was about different politics then, in the different time of cold war, when world was heavily polarized between communism and capitalism.<br/><br/>We will always have some deep political polarization in society, and show that doesn't show that political dimension would be a shallow one. I don't know for what audience this was made. It's fine to make a show about America's racist history (the show starts with the Tulsa riots, which were a real and horrific event), maybe just don't call it Watchmen.<br/><br/>Even after 2 episodes, this show has no real connection with the original comics.<br/><br/>The rest of the world used to watch US shows because of their universal elements, now half of what on TV seems to be made by and for a small minority. The story is so different, but I always try to keep an open mind. After the third episode I will say that the story is not very good and I don't know why in this day and age the director tries to make female actors so violent when it's the opposite. Batwoman lol. When the cowboy was running things maybe, but now it's a black woman, a Russian, and a shinny dude running the show. Very lame, where is Batman The pilot was intriguing and different enough to stir interest. Looking forward to the rest.
Just watched up to episode 5, and it is really good. So pleased that I'm not binge watching because this way, the story unravels, nicely. It is so good. Angela's role works really well and the whole crew are a great team. My fav is looking glass..<br/><br/>This is not suitable for flat dull people.<br/><br/>Watched the next episode and it just gets better.<br/><br/>Now watched the finale and can confirm that this is one of the best TV series, ever. The negative reviews are so obviously biased, and you can see that most of those reviews come from people who could not bring themselves to enjoy this fabulous series for want of 'race' issues. I wonder if those reviews will also cry wolf at the news report today, that a mass burial site may have been discovered in Tulsa. Yes it actually happened, and thanks to Watchmen we all know about it.
Setting that aside, this is such a fabulous show. The detail is a joy, and one that can be repeated each time it is watched. Usully, it is so difficult to rewatch a show, without a long break in between - well as family members joined me, I happily watched the first few episodes, three times. Each time I found something new. Wow! The actors were a fabulous team, and carried the story line superbly. Regina King rocks. Lube man is a global favourite, Blake is a badass cool chief of police, Looking glass man is my favourite. The Easter eggs are a treat to find. My only only only ?? is that Jeremy Irons (is fab) but why the strange accent? Well done and thank you to the team. All the negative reviews are coming from people that 1. immediately decided against mentally investing themselves in the pilot episode once labeling the show as "politically-correct woke garbage" and 2. those that somehow missed the fact that this takes place AFTER the events of the first watchmen movie (so perhaps you won't see characters you did in the movie). I'm always more interested in the low ratings for a tv show I like versus the high ratings, because it offers a totally different perspective which sometimes can be helpful. But the low ratings here are given by people that see this show as an attack on ALL white males, showcasing them as the evil in America. If you really liked the movie, then surely you can give the show more time to get better; it's literally the very first episode. I give the first episode an 7.5-8/10. Wasn't at all what I was expecting, but it still had a good opening, good performances, and good pacing, though there's room for improvement. Prior to the show, I had only seen the Zack Snyder movie and had seen videos about the graphic novel, which was enough to spark a curiosity in me when Damon Lindelof decided to write a spinoff/sequel to Alan Moore's classic comic.
If there's one thing Watchmen the show gets right, it's the atmosphere. Walking the fine line between cynical, satirical and critical, the world of Watchmen draws you into an alternate reality where the racial tension in America is tighter and "Superman exists - and he is American," though not anymore.
The show doesn't immediately provide fan service by needlessly shoehorning in the heroes of the original comic. Instead, it takes its time and introduces new, equally complex characters whose motivations remains as much a mystery until towards the end as everything else in this AU. Which is another commendable feat of Watchmen: it doesn't always pander to the audience or give easy explanations to anything, really. It lets the mystery sit and germinate before exposing its roots.
Really, the only problem I have with this show is its mistrust in the audiences' intelligence. Often times, when a twist is revealed or a revelation takes place, instead of letting the audience connect the dots for themselves, Lindelof often goes the extra mile of spelling it out, which more often than not comes of as spoon-feeding.
Other than this minor and easily overlook-able complain, I have been thoroughly entertained and engaged by this puzzle box of a show. Similar to the first season of Westworld, it makes for a delightful viewing that you can't binge-watch your way through.
Oh, and also, please read the comics first. Another great show from Damon Lindelof as we know and expect it from him. For some people it might be to complex. They should stay with the Mandalorian. DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING THIS 5 STARS OR WORSE.<br/><br/>First off... Let's be real... HBO does not make any 1 star or even 3 star series. This is the first time I have been utterly disappointed in the misleading and Trolling, terrible taste reviewers. Usually, the terrible reviews are left for horror movies but nope. I will just list some other shows that I have liked, westworld, the 100, got, breaking bad, Dexter, the end of the f*cking world, stranger things, black mirror, American horror story. Wasn't really impressed after having watched the first two episodes, but then, the show started to take off. It's absolutely incredible to watch fall the pieces (slowly) in place. I've just finished S1E5 and went from a 7 to a 9. Couldn't have hoped for a better continuation of Watchmen than what's unfolding here. Big thumbs up! I must say Watchmen does not disappoint. My only complaint is I cant watch them all back to back!<br/><br/>Initially he story seemed to drag a bit, but it's necessary for the character development that is happening. The depth of the story and characters are really unraveling nicey after the first 6 episodes.<br/><br/>The comic element and style is brought to the screen tastefully throughout the show and not over done like other work I have seen.<br/><br/>The show is dark, edgy, and fun all at the same time. I can't help but say it's a bit of a divisive plotline but it's still a very entertaining show and after episode 6 I'd say this show is a homerun for hbo. Episode 6 was the best one yet and really provided a lot of clarity on some questions viewers have had since episode 1.<br/><br/>If you like crime, fantasy, sci fi, drama, and superhero flicks you'll love watchmen. Apparently all the kids on 4chan have been told to hate this show so here they all are hating on the show with all their sensitive crying "muh !!!". It's funny how people complaining about political agendas in the media today are constantly trying to enforce their own political agenda on all the rest of us. The irony...<br/><br/>Anyway, the show looks very promising so far. Yes, the first episode did have a slight scent of a simplified racial theme but episode two and three added layers of complexity (which you might overlook if you've already been told to hate the show) that indicates that nothing is as clear cut as it may seem on the surface. I bet that the senator has some dirt in his rucksack that'll turn many things on it's head. ;)<br/><br/>And to all the 4chan sheep: If you downvote this you're proving my point. ;P Melting pot of awesomeness here. put dark night, matrix, inception, sin city, the boys in a blender and directed in a fincher style. wow. also soundtrack is perfection. Wow, reading the reviews (after watching the whole series) it has the divided the community.
I did not know much about the series or read any reviews before watching.
And I have not read the comics (so cant comment on whether or not it is fateful)
and I do not really remembering the movie much.<br/><br/>
I enjoyed the characters, twists and storyline and found it engrossing.
Watch it yourself and make up you own mind,
don't believe reviews either way.
:) Brilliantly done. Should've won more awards. One of my top ten of all time. Like all hbo series you should have known the best episodes of hbo series are the last episodes. Same at the watchmen i review the serie with 6 points till 5th episode after that i gave 8 points to the show be patient its a good show trust me wait 4 episodes to reach the potantiel. No words to describe the series at this point. Almost over and it has been AMAZING.<br/><br/>GIVE IT A TRY AND YOU WILL LOVE IT.<br/><br/>THATS IT. As a big fan I decided to watch the first episode even after my friends told me to stay away. After wasting my one hour of my life did the director actually read the comic before they went on this never never land adventure. They took this great imagination and turned it into a propaganda series, I read something that the right is carpet bombing this. As a left leaning person I can tell you that is false. The carpet bombing is coming from people who actually loved the comics. HBO needs to apologize to Alan Moore. Horrible. A waste of time. The show is a mess. You can not tell what is going on at all. The only thing obviously clear is that they are strongly emphasizing racism and politics. Do they not understand that people watch these shows for enjoyment and entertainment.. If we want politics we can turn on the news. Not only that the plot of this show is horrific it is pretty much over an hour long of random events. Including squid raining from the sky randomly. Yes it is that bad. Literally a bland show trading on the brand name of Watchmen. I was concerned when Damon Lindelof was announced as developing a Watchmen TV show, and it turns out he wasn't, he was a developing a show that had nothing to do with that favourite alternative Earth of ours.<br/><br/>If you want a decent sequel to Watchmen, go and read Doomsday Clock. Really emotionally charged (especially the opening scenes) and feels like it could be part of the leftovers universe, which I for one love. Alan Moore has stated that his original material was deeply political, but that the reader may not have interpreted the characters ( Rorschach In particular) as intended. Lindlehof leaves no room for misinterpretation. A must see. I love this show. Yes, white supremacy and racism is the foundation of the plot... just like when communists used to always be the bad guys. The beginning depicts a real life atrocity against black people that happened in the 1920s OK. This is a good story with action, drama and suspense. It shows the ugliness of racism but also show people who refuse to buy into it, white and black. Watch this show! This show is a huge DISGRACE to the comic!!This is definitely not Watchmen! They just wanted to tell a story and named the show watchmen only to attract more people. I don't even know why I watched it till the last episode. Had high hopes for this, but Anne I am not the target audience. Utter waste and kind of glad there will not be a season 2. Much like Legion, this is the only other comic book superhero inspired show that I genuinely look forward to watching. Maybe it's not faithful to the original source material. Good, because that stuff just never appealed to me.<br/><br/>Of course, there are the usual MRA alt-right incel ding-a-lings ranting on about how it's full of liberal propaganda. And they're right. But that's OK with me because I happen to agree with its message. That's what art is for.<br/><br/>An interesting story. Excellent cinematography. Fresh and moody soundtrack (partial credit to Trent Reznor). Assuming you're not a man-child, what's not to like here? This so far is very good. Not going to go into detail until the end. But I just wanted to say something against all these bots/paid to do a bad review as they probably haven't watched the first three episodes, the film, or the graphic novel (not a comic as some false reviewers have stated, meaning they quiet clearly haven't read it!)<br/><br/>The overall rating for this show is false, due to the negative reviews. Just look at the individual episode ratings and it shows you that the majority of people that actually watched them like them! When I saw the first episode I didn't undertood anything. Loved it!<br/><br/>The second episode is on another level, it is perfect in so many ways, I am in love with this series. To everyone bashing the show, I don't think you realize this was intentionally supposed to be different from the comic and movie - they blatantly say that. I also love everyone's hate towards the show after only watching the first few episodes; it's a series for a reason: not neatly wrapped up in a single episode.<br/><br/>Frankly, I like the homages to the comic and characters' from the universe, though some aren't as I expected.. I like how the show is a gritty superhero show, unlike most superhero flicks being produced today. It has real heavy themes shrouded with dark humor and violence which are all prevalent in today's society. If you don't like the series, have fun watching Disney's superheros. So many dumb trolls are calling it "too political", which is so stupid. The original comics were extremely political and they are too dumb to realize it. It's a good show. Ignore the triggered chuds. The show is respectful to the original in some way, but not as respectful as critics say.
First, it would be a huge lie to say that Alan Moore would love this show. That's an overstatement at least. Yes, the show is great in its depiction of AU history&life, I love the details. That was done perfectly.
However, the whole plot about racism feels very artificial. Like Lindelof was trying to come up with some conflict with two sides that would resemble the Cold War in the original comicbook. The fact racism plot is it's not woke, it just feels out of place. And with the 6th episode of secret origin of Hooded Justice the connection to the original feels even more artificial.
The series certainly struggle with sequel problem of the Disney trilogy: the creators of the show cannot introduce new characters without making them connected to the original ones, but the connection is not realistic in any way. The audience wants to see what happened to the old characters, so Lindelof made some baits: Lorie's line is a bait, because now she wears a name of her father, who raped her mother, and we know a little about her fate (by the end of the series we still knew almost nothing), Veidt's line is also a bait, but a good one.
Making series about cop violence and making cops wear masks were interesting choices. Making Veidt's daughter's line about legacy, the whole drug thing about past and family as representation of past and fate of becoming one's parent were also good decisions, though predictable for a "30 into the future"-sequel.
Doc's decision to have a happy life with a family? I guess it's from Alan Moore's Superman, a controversial decision, but ok.
But all the good things make the racism plot of the series seem even more out of place. It relevance to the original is good visually on the level of details of the worldbuilding, AU and game of hinting things to the audience, but it's disturbingly bad on the higher level of the object-level plot of the comicbook.
I am not sure if it's possible to make a sequel to Watchmen. I can not say that the series is bad or very good, this is only the first chapter, which can be a bit confusing Yes. But he is a pilot.<br/><br/>I think it's a good production, the story is just beginning.<br/><br/>Let them give their best if. Keep it coming I need to see where this show is going, strongly recommend people to read the Alan Moore comic before watching and note the show is set (think) 20 years after following the distruction of new york with the squid. Love how that has continued. Great lead, love Regina King, and it was nice to see you to see you nice Don Johnson. In 2019, this is the show we needed. After Zack Snyder's underrated film of the same name went under the radar, this chapter in the Watchmen franchise is exactly what we needed.<br/><br/>Everybody in the cast and crew is on their A game here. The perfect cast with the perfect story. It was great to finally see the Minutemen in live action format and to see the birth of Hooded Justice in live action.....<br/><br/>I have no words to describe how good this show actually is I hated it.. just like the terrible movie that came out years ago. Was hoping maybe the show would give me more than the movie did. This show seems to be about something else entirely. Coming from someone who has neither seen the movie or dabbled in the comic books, I still found Watchmen to be wildly entertaining. All 10 episodes collectively build on each other until all of the pieces fall into place. Beautiful shot, incredibly acted, and an overall enjoyable experience. The whole theme and feel of the series is captivating, even for someone not typically drawn to this "type" of television. 10/10 & would recommend to all of my friends. WATCH THIS SHOW!!! The new Watchmen series was fantastic, probably the best television I've watched all year. Don't listen to anyone who hasn't watched past episode 1, they took the bait-the bait being the wild assumption that AN HBO SHOW (home of The Wire & The Sopranos) would pander to Hollywood's "liberal agenda" to please "sjw" audiences, when HBO has always been home to controversial, yet subversive, complex, and sophisticated TV. Just as Watchmen has always been critical of conservatism, Neo-liberalism. war, superheroes, and human nature in and of itself. On some levels, Watchmen's context concerning the Vietnam War-arguably the most significant socio-political event of its time-mirrors, and thus, strengthens this new seasons context which deals with policing, Neo-liberalism/liberalism, and white supremacy-some of the biggest issues of our current time.<br/><br/>The writing is superb, absolutely amazing. Every episode drops tiny seeds of plot and character development, with just enough mystery to keep you guessing and just enough information to keep you watching. Contrary to popular belief, the show is incredibly nuanced, and on top of that, impossible to predict, so again anyone who
hasn't watched past episode 1 didn't see the social criticism and self-awareness inherent in the subject matter, and to their detriment, will miss out on a show that is one hell of a ride. I have used IMDB since before it was an app and have never written a review. But, this show...so great in so many ways. From representation to great storyline. Ugh. Love love LOVED IT!!!!! All the actors, the cinematography, the music...everything....epic. If you're a fan of the comic, the movie...you'll love the show. The original comic series The Watchmen broke the mould for comics at the time. Moore and Gibbons channeling literate ways of storytelling, with added social commentary, action, interesting characters and even a love story.<br/><br/>This new TV series is not a retelling of the comic series, instead being primarily set some 30 odd years later using some of the same characters. The highest compliment I can say is that this is the closest homage in TV, film, comic books and novels I've seen to the original. The story plays with structure but is coherent. The style, look and feel like Gibbons world. There is commentary on today's society, which given the amount of knicker wetting reviews on IMDB are clearly landing home to some very sensitive people. There is emotional connections with the characters and a credible love story at the centre.<br/><br/>If you liked the comic series then give this a go. 1/10? Get outta here, what're you, twelve?
This show is great. Try watching a few episodes, see if you don't agree. I just watched ep. 8, and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. I'm rating this 10/10 to combat the trolling, would probably say 8.5-9/10 otherwise. I loved the original comic, but I'm so glad that they're trying to create something of their own. I don't really understand a lot of these reviews. Watchmen has always been political, and what do you know, a show set in America talks about our social and political issues. If you're too fragile and can't handle that, then this show isn't for you. A lot of people seem upset that this isn't told from the perspective of Rorschach as well, but I welcome that change. If you identify with Rorschach, then you completely missed the point of Watchmen. The only thing I worry about for this show is that if you haven't read, or even simply saw the 2009 movie, then this may move a bit fast for you. There's a lot of great videos online that provide context if you need it though. Lindeloff has not given us the Watchmen we want, he gave us the Watchmen we deserve. This show really feels like the New Testament to Moore and Gibbons Old Testament. So far this show has equally challenged both extremes (liberal and conservative). It's also challenging how we talk and view race relations by using actual history.<br/><br/>All while having great characters and a thoroughly engaging story.<br/><br/>I love this show keep up the great work Watchmen team at HBO I'm going to keep this short.<br/><br/>A lot of negative reviews on IMDB seem to be from people who stopped watching it after Episode 1.
It's true that this pilot episode is weird, confusing, and can deter some viewers from ever watching the rest of the show.<br/><br/>It's also a way to pull you into this weird universe by raising many open questions and making you want to get the answers, I suppose,
What you need is just a little patience because the show will give you answers progressively in the following episodes and greatly reward your patience by blowing your mind.. (in a nice way) Wow what an amazing series couldn't stop watching it eagerly waiting for episode four I have so many questions. I am loving the character plotlines. The timelines and perspective is worth watching more! Waste of the time. After something started to fail on cars from he sky, it was clear that it is a wasting of the time The new series follows both the comic and the movie beautifully, while also becoming as relevant to our world as the comic was to its time. So well done. Acting, writing, direction, design... all perfect. This is a tv / series work of art! Extremely well rounded storytelling, amazing reflection on nowadays issues. Respective off source material and highly entertaining. Not suitable for mediocre audiences. I've enjoyed this more than any tv show I recent years! Show's 1st season is nearly finished, and I'm consistently riveted. Initially, I watched the first teaser trailer casually expecting to find reasons why not to watch the show, to maybe avoid it for the sake of keeping my feelings about 'Watchmen' comic (and yes, even the movie) pure. But that feeling turned immediately into riveted intrigue, and it's been there ever since; this show has simply delivered for me. It's rare that a prequel or sequel (or whatever this technically ends up resembling) manages to pay dutiful homage and even fly off the handle in its own direction. Absolutely impressive. Brilliant show. Disappointed that it's drawing to a close. The very fact that it's not a remake or anything but a sequal kind of thing based on the "Watchmen" is in itself commendable. The series gets on to become better and better as you watch along. The amazing use of the characters like Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan in an alternative time zone and the Ozymandias universe is a treat.
Don't go by the rating. It's a must watch if you're a "Watchmen" fan and even if you're not, you're gonna love it. I really wanted to like it. It is slow paced, very few of the characters are likable or sympathetic. I can't say that I know much about the comic, but I enjoy Damon Lindelof's previous shows. As a super fan of Lost and The Leftovers, I'm going to give it a couple more episodes, only to know more about what Jeremy Irons' character is up to.
The only interesting element of the show so far.<br/><br/>I don't know why so many critics gave this good reviews.
I think the politics might have had something to do with it.
If you're not WOKE, you might just lose your cushy reviewing job to someone who is. STORY<br/><br/>How many times must the same thing be said? The fact that two or three ideas are good, does not mean that you can or should mix them. This is why I hate most American Horror Story seasons/stories. By doing so you create a mess. It is not so damn difficult to comprehend. You can't mix oil and water. In the end of the day it is that simple.<br/><br/>So, Watchmen (the series) is taking place 30+ years after the events of the movie. The movie was about the Cold War, the series is about race relations. OK, I am starting having an issue here, since the two seem incompatible. Let's see what the writers have to offer.<br/><br/>After the events of the movie there was a crucial question that was left (purposely) unanswered; Did Rorschach's letter get published? And if so, how did the world react to it? This is a very crucial question that any series that is based at the movie must answer. Did the first episode answer that question? No! If you want me to be able to move from one story-line (the Cold War) to the next (racial relations), then you have to answer that question. It is 101 world building. What is the world at which the series is taking place? Is it a world where Ozymandias' actions are revealed or not? And if they were revealed, how did the world react? When Ozymandias blamed Dr. Manhattan, he united the world and the Cold War ended. If his plans were revealed did the Cold War resume? Did the US win the Cold War in another way? Is there USSR? Is the Cold War still taking place? You can't have me invest at your new story-line without concluding the old one.<br/><br/>I'll say again. The movie left that question purposely unanswered, and there was nothing wrong with that, quite the opposite. The series though and any direct or indirect sequel must provide an answer. And since the focus now is something else (race relations) then I want the answer at the first episode and the answer should be a negative one,so I can move on and focus at the new story-line. If the letter was published then the repercussions should be explored, and I suppose that can take an entire season to explain, BUT this would be unrelated to the new theme. You can't have them both. You have to chose. Either the series has a new theme (race relations) and the previous theme is concluded early on, or you continue with the previous theme. As the series has a new theme, we need that answer here and now, in order to move past the previous theme. Just one line, just one scene, just a passing comment from a narrator, just an Easter egg (e.g. something shown at the TV). Nothing major. Something small, something that will allow the show to move to the next chapter. Something like the opening of the movie, at which we were seeing the points of divergence between our reality and the "watchmen reality". There are so many options here. You know what is not an option? Leave that question hanging. This question requires an answer in order for a person's suspension of disbelief to work.<br/><br/>I suppose some defenders of the show (and the writers) will cite "Doomsday Clock". Since Robert Redford is the president of the US we can assume that the events at Doomsday Clock took place? Well, I have many problems with that, the two major ones being; a) "Doomsday Clock" is supposed to be a crossover between the main DC Universe (Batman, Superman and co) and the Watchmen universe, so not the best of material to base your Watchmen series at and b) "Doomsday Clock" continued the story of the comic, which was not about race relations, but instead was about the Cold War and WW3/Nuclear War.<br/><br/>Moving past that crucial mistake, the series still has narrative and story problems. So, basically for some reason (called "the white night") there is some sort of a police state; The cops now are hiding their faces, supposedly for their "protection". On the other hand though, the cops are not carrying a gun and they need special authorization in order for their guns to be unlocked! That's confusing. To make matters even more confusing, the protagonist (Sister Night) basically tortures a suspect! OK, we are back at police state then? What is the series trying to do? Justify torture? Make a police state look a shade of grey? Make the point that a black/white way to view the world (Rorschach's way) is bad and viewing everything in shades of grey is good? No! A Police State is not a shade of grey! A Police State is "black", end of story. There is room for "black and white" as well as "shades of grey" ways to view things. Some things are grey, some are black and some are white. A Police State and torture are "black".<br/><br/>When the police officers are not showing their faces, they are left unchecked, which is why in many countries not only they do not allow the police officers to hide their features but also are obliging them to have name tags on their uniforms. That allows the people to hold them accountable for their actions. This in turn explains why we do not have masked vigilantes in real life and is, partially, the idea behind the Keene Act of the original movie/comics. So now, the police officers can use masks? That could have been acceptable if the irony was explored in the series...it is not. And don't get me the whole "it is too early". A series sets the tone for what it will explore early on. If it doesn't, that is a problem on itself.<br/><br/>Another narrative problem has to do with the "Seventh Kavalry" which is a white supremacy group...that follows/worship Rorschach?!! Since when Rorschach became a racist? Sure he is "right wing"/right wing, but racist? That's a stretch. And not only that, but it is also a slippery slope to say that all right wing persons are racists. It is racist by itself for starters. As a far-Left person, I will battle right wing ideology any day and time, but I will not treat right wing people in a demeaning way (there is a difference between a person and their ideology), even more so to go as far and say that they are all a bunch.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are a few things here and there that make the whole mess even more confusing. One has to do with the world's ideology. Robert Redford and Nixon are shown at a school poster among the 4 most important Presidents of the US (the other two being Washington and Lincoln). In the watchmen fictional universe, Nixon was a right wing politician and Redford a left wing politician. At one scene Sister Night goes to a place and arrests someone (whom she later tortures), at which place Redford is being portrayed negatively and Nixon positively. So, which one is it? Can the two Presidents be portrayed together (per the school poster) or not? You can't have both. Either the series portrays a world at which these two ideologies (represented by each of the two Presidents) reconcile somehow or they are at each other's throats.<br/><br/>Then, Dr. Manhattan makes a cameo at the first episode...excuse me but what? He had left the Earth for places unknown, now he is at Mars where NASA and every other space agency can spot him? Is it the movie Dr. Manhattan that was blamed and seen by the world as a threat or is it the comics Dr. Manhattan? And how the writers will fit this...God, into their story about race relations? Is the series gonna shift back and forth between the race relations story-arc and the Cold War/Armageddon Arc? Apparently it will, since after the first episode's ending we got a "this season at Watchmen" glimpse of what is to come. Keep things simple. A race relations story isn't bad per se, quite the opposite, and it is important and complex by itself. You can have an entire series just about that, you don't need another story-arc. The problem has to do with how it is being presented, and if they go the "we have two (unrelated) arcs to show you", it is not the best way to present either story.<br/><br/>ACTING/PRODUCTION/DIRECTION<br/><br/>The production value of the show is good, it is in HBO after all. Direction wise it is also a little bit above good, following the production value of the show. Nothing exceptional so far though, but really good nonetheless.<br/><br/>Acting is great, and I enjoyed Regina King's acting the most. I think that both directing and acting could have had been better if the story was any good.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS and VERDICT<br/><br/>Not a bad series, not good either, but one with no clear goal and one that does injustice to itself. No-one should expect more from Damon Lindelof. If you are a fan of the movie or the comics, I think this series is NOT for you.<br/><br/>Someone had the "great" idea and said "let's take a story about humanity's existence and make a race relations story out of it". Well, that is dumb and self-defeating. They should have made a new series about race relations if this is what they want.<br/><br/>Also why is Alan Moore not credited! Give the man some credit. Dave Gibbons was credited but Alan Moore was not? I hate these things! At this point I am even afraid to ask why Alan Moore was not credited. First episode people need to relax and give the show a chance. But after reactions of GOT fans on the last season. I'm not shocked with so many critics out here It's getting better and better with each passing episode. The first episode leaves the viewer a bit dumbfounded as to how it's related to Watchmen at all, and that it focuses too much on modern issues. But, keep watching because it becomes a lot more apparent as to how it's all intertwined with the Watchmen universe. The makers have done a great job so far in my opinion.<br/><br/>You won't regret it.<br/><br/>Remember, they're not gonna give you all the goods in the very first episode....so keep watching. The first three episodes are hands down the best television I've seen in years. Every element fits together perfectly-the writing, the cast, the directing. It is both smarter and more entertaining than almost anything else out there. I was thinking about cancelling my HBO subscription, not gonna happen any time soon because of this show. Great TV, don't listen to haters and give it a chance. Great material and love the leading actress. Only qualm with the show is that it should treat the subject matter seriously, not in a fantastical manner. But the show subverts that strong message with a lack of cohesion and stability in the plot. Really disappointed. Just b/c there are superheroes is no excuse. Hopefully this is corrected in Season 2. Will make the show a lot better I am not familiar with the comic, yet have seen the movie, and feel that this adaptation, however disloyal to the original source material according to others. Is an intriguing and captivating story based on an alternate universe in current times, and plays well with some historical fact. The cast is amazing and I'm hooked within the first two episodes. Honestly, everyone giving this show low ratings seem to be basing it on the fact that it doesn't carry on the original graphic novel. Two episodes in and I can't wait to see where it goes. I am not a big fan of PC messages and finger wagging at the audience, and I don't feel it does that. Honestly people, quit being so rigid in your expectations when pages from your favorite comics are brought to life. That is what makes these art forms so interesting. Lighten up and enjoy. I read the comic and saw the movie. This isn't that but something new and I'm grateful. Not a fan of his other shows but so far, this is interesting and well done! As a hardcore comic book fan, I couldn't expect a better film adaptation than this. Damon Lindelof's passion for Alan Moore's comic is evident, and this series manages to capture the spirit of the original work, while moving in an autonomous direction. In this regard, however, I don't think anyone who has never read the comic book can fully appreciate this series. The world of Watchmen is already a world in itself complicated, and without having followed the trail of the comic it's hard to avoid a further sense of disorientation, especially in the face of the countless references that Lindelof makes to Moore's comic.<br/><br/>However, after Lost and Leftovers, Damon Lindelof continues to produce works of refined quality and remarkable depth. Once again, themes dear to him return: moral amibiguity, attention to the interiority of individuals who have to deal with the consequences of an inexplicable event (the advent of giant squid), the suffering that all men hide behind their masks, built to defend their identity from attacks from the outside world (in Watchmen the theme of the mask becomes even more concrete, as the heroes and anti-heroes actually wear a mask to conceal their identity),
the old testamentary symbolism (in particular the theme of the apocalypse) and the weaving of an intricate network of relationships that involves all characters, managing to frame, even surprisingly, the stories of the old comic characters with those of the new ones he created .<br/><br/>On the strictly technical side, the actors' performances are excellent, none excluded. The tracks that make up the soundtrack are also well selected.<br/><br/>One less vote for the final, in particular for the last twenty minutes, in my view a little too trivial. More courageous choices could have been made,
avoiding falling into a somewhat conciliatory ending, in the same way as the rest of the entertainment products of the television industry do. Cards on the table - I come into this as an American from the increasingly shrinking center. I feel like both the right and the left have gone crazy at this point.<br/><br/>I loved the movie. The first episode of the series had me really worried that it was going to be a vehicle for beating me over the head with how bad a person I am because of the color of my skin and possibly my gender (the left sees no irony here, BTW). I talked to my brother, who had watched a few more episodes, and with his assurances I kept on.<br/><br/>The first season ended up being wonderful. It really does keep the flavor of the graphic novel and the film. There are many nice surprises and several of the characters you loved from the original, just somewhat changed (or not!) by the intervening years. Using white supremacists as the adversary still seems a bit of a one-dimensional choice but by the end you discover some things that cause it to make more sense.<br/><br/>As with the graphic novel I love the exploration of how Dr Manhattan interprets time and what that might indicate about the universe.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the graphic novel or the movie then this is highly recommended. Try not to have a knee-jerk reaction going in and you will have a good time. I genuinely enjoyed the story line and editing of this series... Yet once again, HBO overthought the idea of pushing the envelope and provided their dedicated fans with an unbelievable politically correct ending. With nothing more than the intention of pleasing PC culture. Huge disappointment to an otherwise well made series. When will HBO learn how to once again end a story line that doesn't adhere to a pathetic attempt at being "progressive" Damon Lindeloff + Regina King is a good formula for making TV shows. Every character, every scene is there with a purpose. In the end, everything makes sense, no one can stay impassive, you need to revisit the previous episodes and to thank to all that people creating art for TV, creating stories and telling them in such a magnificent way.
I hadn't read the comic nor viewed the movie, so the experience was entirely delivered by this serie. ...iant. This is awesome. I have no clue what is going on here bit it is great. Look and listen very carefully for everything what is happening in this wicked toocool story. Let it grow and develop on you before you judge it. I want to write more but episode 6 is drumrolling ... watch(it)men !! At the beginning.. there was disappoitment, but like so many other "eventually" great series series have done in the past, this one is already getting better and for this series i am quite surprised about it.. It's getting better and better. What a great show. This is not for everybody but give it a try. Trolls and Critics are sick in the head i swear, this is probably the best graphic novel adaptation ever made on TV,a perfect TV show.. Okay this show revolves around race hate crimes so if your someone who cant stand 'white man getting taken down by the black man' type then this isnt for you but if you love action and look at the race hate as a actual crime then you should love watching the criminals get what they rightly deserve there is too much in this show for kids to take as well as there is blood nudity filthy language but aside from that the show is pretty much perfection The spirit of the comic is there. The performances are powerful. Don Johnson and Jeremy Irons really outstanding. I'm devoted to the series and strongly recommend it I'm utterly dumbfound at the amount of reviews bashing this show on the basis that it "isn't Watchmen." Do we really need a rehashing of Snyder's vapid and stylistically violent 2009 adaptation? No, we absolutely do not.<br/><br/>Snyder's attempt only gives more weight to Alan Moore's apprehension and strong disproval towards having his work adapted to cinema. Despite being a "frame-by-frame" remake, the film wholeheartedly fails to capture the core ethos of the graphic novel, one which sought to demonstrate that if super hero's were real, they'd likely be with twisted moral compasses, seeing themselves as judge, jury, and (and on occasion) executioner. I remember being sixteen and reading Watchmen for the first time and being downright terrified of the Comedian, a character who carried out abhorrent acts of violence that shocked me, not excited me. Instead what audiences got was a two dimensional glossing over of an otherwise gritty and thought provoking work, one meant to subvert the shallow and predictable ethics of the average comic book. And now that someone has finally done something interesting with the Watchmen as canon, what? People are horrified that it's not the same garbage?<br/><br/>Lindelof's choice to take the narrative as far away form the original as possible is a breath of fresh air, brining to life a compelling world that engages viewers to different ends (though I'm sure many would have preferred trampling over the same characters Snyder already butchered in 2009). Some seem to love Lindelof's strange re-imagining of an American society flipped upside down, while others are driven to writing drivel - reviews tantamount to "Watchmen's political implications threaten my inflated sense of moral superiority and so it must be horrible." Trolls have even dubbed it propaganda, paying little attention to the way in which Watchmen calls into question many hot topic issues in a way that is by no means one sided.<br/><br/>While I can understand grievances directed towards Hollywood's recent attempts to cash in on woke culture, leading to some godawful writing, HBO's watchmen is just fantastic (it would appear that any tv show with a female lead and something relevant to say now constitutes as "liberal brainwashing"). The cinematography is excellent, the characters are interesting, the plot has me hooked, and most importantly, it does an incredible job of playing out current tensions bubbling to the surface of the American social fabric, displacing them into an eerie world that is very much like ours, yet so different. The fact that this show has upset so many people only speaks to its relevance and efficacy. Yes, Rorschach, who Alan Moore himself has repeatedly stated was written as an "extremely right wing character," has become the figure head for a far-right domestic terrorist group, much to the dismay of an audience that has deeply miss-understood the author's true intentions. Does this mean that Watchmen is a bad show? No. I opened this title thinking that it's anything like the movie. It's not. At all. You could create this series as something else and it might be ok.<br/><br/>What ever was done here based on the comic books did not land, I won't spoil in this review so that you have to go through the episodes to feel disappointment. No one loved the movie more than I. I just don't get what's happening. And I also have dozens of useless questions. Like who's kids are those? What's with the TV show they're all watching, who's the guy on the porch from deadwood (Ellsworth)....why are the bad guys all Rorschachs. is this in the future....I literally just don't get enough of a framework to keep me interested (even though Regina king is a genius). Clever writing entices, and if there's a gun in the first act, it gets used in the 3rd. This feels like 100s of disjointed bits of random clues as to where this is going and who's who in the school. A movie has two hours and has to follow a structure. This has 10 hours and is hoping for another 10 next year and it's a challenge to map that out. This didn't do it well enough for me. I have no idea what is going on, and even worse, I'm having a hard time caring. That's a writing, mapping and character problem. Regina has to carry the entire show and could as an actress but not up against too many confusing bits that don't either entertain it move the story forward. Bottom line: the writers are trying to be "interesting". And That's a rough road for him and us. Watched 2 episodes and thats 2 hours of my life wasted .
What on earth is all the fuss about ?
I was bored silly .... It is as if the wraters are trying to do something peofound without accomplishing it and while the audience just gets bored. This is how shows die. Build, build, build, eh. I thought it ended fairly well but it was a lot of nuancing and I'm not sure it quite finished completely. But since it won't be airing again and I don't see how it could with these characters, I guess it was fair. I just don't think this franchise is what people think it's going to be. There's a reason Marvel is on top and DC is second. This show has become the show I watch when I'm caught up with everything else. It's not bad. It's not good. It's just ok. Once again, Lindenhoff helms one of the most original things currently in filmed entertainment. It is not Watchmen the comics, except it is. It is not a superherytale, except it is. It's about the present. It's about the future. It's about the past. It's about what is and what could be. The dialogue is fantastic, the design and details are incredible, the acting is top rate. It is unlike anything else currently on TV. Actors and writers, in fact the entire crew, do a fantastic job. But even through episodes 4, I remain somewhat confused and motivated to get the written material to orient myself.<br/><br/>Bringing this story to screen makes it more accessible, right??? But so far, 4 hours into it, I'm still confused as to how all the characters inter-relate. I find myself giving-in to the notion that I must just sit back, and let it be revealed... but how many times have I invested time into such stories only to be disappointed???<br/><br/>I kinda feel like things need to get tied together pretty quick or I'm out ... and maybe I will stream the series in binge-mode later. I could not help thinking the show started at page one of a comic book episode then went to page 23 then to page 48 then on to page 78. Episode 1 was all over the place and amazingly Don Johnson was the only character with any semblance of development.
In a show so mired in chaos, there has also predictability. Poor cows.
HBO might be depending on faithful followers but this discombobulated mess needs cohesion, connection and sort of explanation. Those two episodes where just the same. It was going nowhere. Reading other reviews, it seems it continued this way. Gave up. The first reviewers were expecting a pure comics show, the likes of DC and Marvel. Instead they got quality drama with depth and real story-line so they got upset. This show should be 9 and above. period. If you like unusual shows that keep you guessing, you'll like Watchmen. I wasn't familiar with the source material, so I got lost along the way, but I didn't give up -- so glad I didn't. By the end of episode 3, I was enthralled... great storytelling, mysteries, acting, character development... I dont write reviews...ever...but i have to do it now...best on tv...love. This series takes the best parts of the comic and the movie, then twists them hard, hammer forged story, that shoots them out at you in mind bending fashion.
This, so far, is the best interpretation of the Watchmen comic I have ever seen!
Now, maybe you dont agree, because you are a graphic novel purest, but honestly, ones and twos as ratings for this show? Is that a joke?
Even if you dont like it, you still need to respect how much effort went into making this series what it is...a 7 or an 8 would be more on the money... just so you trolls know. I watched the whole series and its truly amazing. Most reviews are from the 1-2 episodes and they never saw the whole season. Please give it a chance and watch it complete. I did not know anything about this show. A friend said I should watch it. I just finished the first episode and now I'm very interested! There is so much history I want to know more about. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS SHOW! The music! The action! The layering storyline!! It's all gold! This is not your typical superhero story, and I think that might be what I love most about this series. Forget about the nay-sayers, or controversy; if you're looking for something different, something exciting and thought-provoking - then watch Watchmen! If you're not hooked by the first episode, then this isn't a show for you. 8/10<br/><br/>Plot: After the shooting of a cop, police begins to go after 7th Cavalry. The fight between the racist group and vigilante like cops intensifies as the chief of police is found lynched.<br/><br/>There are several story-lines but the main one is focused on Angela Abar (Regina King). The death of chief of police, the return of 7th Cavalry, meeting with her grandfather and a mysterious lady named Lady Trieu all seems to be connected with her.<br/><br/>There are some really good moments in the show. The production value is high and looks amazing. The action is well done and just cool to look at. The way the story is presented is superb. The costumes are cool and loved the origin story of The hooded man. The lady Trieu and Bian is amazing. Dialogues are amazing.<br/><br/>Not as good as some of the reviews are saying. After the first 3 episodes I was hyped. I felt I have found the best show of the year and till 7th episodes I was very happy with it. But after the 9th episode I feel like something is missing. I just don't care what happened not sure if anything happened at all. The lead actress is just flat. She has two mode, aggressive and lips shaking crying. Laurie Blake character is annoying to look at, almost ruined the whole experience. There are many plot holes especially near the end, as if they threw the logic out the window and just wanted to put 5 episodes materials in 1.<br/><br/>Over all it is an above average show with some amazing moments. But the show does not go anywhere. Visual treat with little to no substance. I am still confused as to how it was entertaining yet boring at the same time? So glad that I gave it a chance because it is a great watch. Very well made, intriguing and creates a totally immersive alternate reality! Great characters! And I love the slow building of the story/backstory as well as the alternate world. Each episode you learn new and interesting things that add layers of complexity to their world.<br/><br/>I understand why many anti-PC viewers saw the pilot and thought this was a show made by hollywood liberals. I can assure you that its not. It is good science fiction and the fact that they touch on some classic liberal tropes (white nationalism/racism) does not detract from the story/sci-fi.<br/><br/>I recommend everybody give it a try for at least the first three episodes and you'll see that the Watchman universe is alive and well! The much anticipated Watchmen 2019 makes its debut riddled with tons of questions and criticism. It seems most viewers were expecting a carbon copy of the comics or the successful movie. This version not only follows the original formula, but turns up the levels of twists and turns, psychotic-laden vigilantes and villains, and obvious story bread crumbs for us to follow. Great cast which includes Regina King, Tim Blake Nelson, Jeremy Irons, Don Johnson, Louis Gossett Jr., Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Frances Fisher, Jean Smart, Andrew Howard, Sarah Vickers, Tom Mason, and Adelaide Clemens. For those who can't follow along with the story or are confused by the political chess gaming, subtle hints of racial conflict, and overall blurred lines of good and evil, Watchmen may not be for you. For me, I like my heroes or vigilantes with a little " piss and vinegar". attitude. Don't blink, get up and grab a snack, or take a bathroom break! You don't want to miss any of the action, folks! Funny seeing all the snowflakes getting triggered by this show, I can see why they wouldn't like it with intelligent sequences/writing and dialogue. It reminds me oddly enough of Mr Tibbs and Mississippi burning. Which hopes to instill some much needed compassion in our lives.
I read one reviewer saying politics has no place in a watchmen show?!? Really?
The show has really intrigued me.
Characters are real and engaging, cinematography is beautiful and the Trent Reznor score is perfect. I love the take 35 years on, for me this honors the original comics and builds on that particular world.
Great show I agree with the overall agenda of this series. I don't like that they used watchmen to push it. Like many have said, this could be any show. It doesn't have to be watchmen. I just want to escape and visit a world that has costumed heroes with a gritty, philosophical twist. And what the hell did they do to dr manhattan? He was above all of this the last time we saw him. Comic or movie. And now he's trying to have a family? And he murders every Rorschach (don't get me started with his legacy) dude except the one that kills him because that's what is supposed to happen? Mystery, intrigue, origin story's, back story's and full story arcs. Incredible show great aesthetics and soundtrack. No interest in this previously but came because of leftovers, thanks to all involved. I wasn't expecting much, but this is a work of brilliance. Regina King and Jeremy Irons are outstanding throughout, and in my view this is a fitting extension of Moore's original story.<br/><br/>Risks are taken throughout, which will understandably alienate some viewers, but the story really pulls together. Upon a second viewing the series comes into its own, echoing Dr Manhattan's experiences of time as a simultaneous event. The Tulsa massacre, Vietnam, the New York incident, and contemporary events all overlap logically.<br/><br/>It's a series that requires commitment. The early episodes can be quite jarring, but it evolves over time and builds into a wonderful and powerful story. There's nothing like it in terms of visuals or plot. This new interpretation of the source material really gives us something to think about-- systemic racist, generational trauma and the corrupting effects of great power. As we learned from Spider-Man "With great power comes great responsibility". And I know Regina King already has an Oscar, two Emmys and a Golden Globe but she needs some more awards for this. Her believability and depth of character really sold the show for me. I dont think they will do a sequel to "Watchman" but if they did, I'd be all I was prepared to hate it. I think I almost wanted to hate it. Not just the "sacrilege" of continuing the source material, but I also have little faith in LindelÃ¶f. I think he's had good ideas but no follow through.
The show is remarkable though. The style, writing, characters, immersion and believability. I can't say enough about it and how great I think they've done so far. I can't wait to see where they take it next and hope more people give the show a try. I actually enjoy it more than the film. It'd be cool if they added more action to the fight sequences but they aren't bad. It is pretty cool that they added some Black and Asian culture and history to the American story, and it sounds like Regina King worked hard in learning Vietnamese as I notice a lot of actors don't put any effort into learning Asian languages very well (the other exception being Don Cheadle speaking very fluent Cantonese in Rush Hour). There isnt really anything wrong with the show, i just didnt like it. the action didnt hook me in. i didnt care about the drama. the music felt jarring. and the family scenes bored me. i guess i expected too much.<br/><br/>4/10: its fine, but i didnt like it This show has been excellent so far! Anyone saying that this isn't Watchmen has not read the comics. Star studded cast with excellent acting. I can't wait to see how this first season ends. I was expecting a grimy, thriller series with all the great charters from the movie.<br/><br/>It's another Hollywood show with waaay too much talking, which isn't always bad, but in this series it's awkward and boring feeling like it leads to nowhere.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm going to watch the third episode... Brilliant show. I've watched the movie but never looked into anything else about it. It draws you in very quickly and always keeps you guessing, while keeping it fun and exceptionally strange at times. Probably the best show of 2019! Don't give it a miss. What a third episode ! One of the best episode I have ever seen, whatever is the show !!!! Now I have to think about my top 10 episode. Post-modern Prometheus, X-files e05s05 will be top 10ed. And a few more ðŸ¤” It gets better and better episode by episode. It has masochist and sour taste which makes you like an addict of a dark bitter chocolate. I wish the second season in coming up. Simply awesome - then again if you are not knowing the original comic maybe not so. This is the aftermath and the prequel. Enjoy I was SUPER sceptical going into this. I loved the graphic novel and loved the movie. I also hated Lost, so to say I was warey is an understatement. Tell a story and have an ending in mind. This show really tells a whole story and it's great. The twist and turns are wonderful. You spend days thinking about every single episode. If you're on the fence like I was, I'd recommend taking the plunge. It's not an easy Task to continue the story having so many years of alternative "official" history to catch up, to explore.
The show star confuse for 3 episode, then we have larger deeper break-trough Gritty amazing music to cover something that is going to be epic, that's the tase of this shoe after 5 ep. Thanks Everything is right in this serie. Ignore the haters they are just disappointed because it is a bit different then they're stupid comic.
Go watch it men! You won't regret Not near as bad as the movie, but still dumb. I feel confused watching this. Plots and characters unidentified and allbover the place. I don't plan on waiting 10 more episodes to find out where it is going. Yawn!!! ANOTHER STRETCHED OUT SHOW. Move it along American shows. Life is short. Hurry it the F up. I am bored. I like the layout of the story as it depicts todays controversies, not only about race and ethnicity, but also on ethics and morals. It's very dark, it should be, as the world today isn't looking to great. AN AMAZING SHOW! you'll see. For the first half of the pilot I was hoping that it is a joke and suddenly some main hero would wake up and the movie would make sense. Unfortunately nothing like that happened, this movie is really stupid, below any level of stupidity. How could anyone give money for it? Even propaganda should not be so stupid, because it has the opposite effect. Anyone who doesnt loke this show is silly. I just finished it and HAVE to rate it even though I dont much it is so awesome and sad and weird, its everything. It is truly uncanny how many people wrote condemning reviews about its lack of relation to "watchmen" or its "political agenda" after 1 or 2 episodes. Their loss if they lack the stamina for a show that takes time to build and evolve. The progressive incorporation of watchmen history / nostalgia is sure to entrance anyone with an ounce of patience. But moreover, the cornucopia of historical and cultural references the show revolves around turn this into a treasure trove for those who appreciate these things. I found myself looking up nutty gritty details through the show to even further appreciate some of the minute but precisely woven references.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you're looking for a basic superhero show, perhaps this won't be your cup of tea, but if you want a show about heroes and villains that incorporates meaning and offers cultural and historic relevance, the Watchmen tv series is second to none. Excellent story telling. Very well interwoven with the original watchmen without being imperative to have read/watched it.<br/><br/>Hang in until the end and all of your questions will be answered. First these guys to even try to film these and pull of this story arch which has never been seen before. Think what "Lost" tried to do with first two seasons and actually did it. Masterful, one of the best shows I have ever watched. If you start the show, you will see a lot of questions and strange things emerge. All the questions will be answered and all pieces will fit together. Considering the questions part was so absurd to beginning with it is amazing they pulled it. Personally I like that complexity which is so rare these days. For that it is 10/10. This is something else, read the comics for yourself and see if this is a show driven by a director's agenda or a director's adaptation of today's politics and social "issues". Either way it stinks because when I watch a superhero show or any show for that matter I'd like to escape from the garbage I constantly read in the news or social media. I say garbage because 99% of it is today. I guess this show is just following suit. Interesting story, engaging and bizarre. It's not a great succesor to the graphic novel by any means, but if you consider it as a stand alone piece, then it's a good watch.<br/><br/>That ending tho... it was awful. Loved every second. A smart, well written story that fits in wonderfully with the universe created by the comics and the movie. A fun journey that gets better with every episode! I felt obligated to write a review for this one.<br/><br/>How come there are so many negative comments written on 21st of October, one day after the first episode got released?!<br/><br/>After the first episode you can barely say what is happening or give any opinion about the entire season. 100% of those reviews are incorrect, false, vague and completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Just because you have the opportunity to be heard doesn't mean that you have to complain without a reason.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE SERIES IT SELF:
The characters development is very good.
Surprises in every episode.
The cast is unbelievable (Tim Blake Nelson, is killing it. Jeremy Irons made me hate him for a couple of days. Yahya Abdul is so good. And Regina is a very strong female character without the cliches).
The back and forward in time requires a lot of casting material and HBO created it's own past and future witch i am loving. This is one of the best detective/super hero shows I have seen. I hope they run it for 5+ seasons. Unless...like other shows it falls off. But the first few episodes have me hooked and wanting more. All this hate is absolutely unfounded and absurd, the show is truly Watchmen and every single new mystery will keep you at the edge of your seat.
The racism runs rapant both in the show and amongst some "fans", and that's depressing as hell because there's no Sister Night to beat their asses in real life. If you were a fan of the comics or the more, you'll probably hate this show. They couldn't have been more off with this one, bad acting, and even worse writing. I had to jump in here because of all the bad reviews due to it not following the book, or comic. That's not fair to any show. It should be rated on its own merit. I had never heard of Watchmen in any format. My husband started watching this, I didn't start until episode 4. It was very hard to grasp coming in late, but I'm hooked.<br/><br/>I watch TV for entertainment, not to sit and dissect every scene looking for hidden meanings, or trying to figure out if it is meant to say something about our current state of affairs.<br/><br/>This show is entertaining, I love that it's unpredictable, I have no idea what is going to happen next. The writing and acting is great. Superb! A true reflection of what ifs and a great follow up to the film. History rewritten often shows where we are heading. Fantastically casted. As a fan of Watchmen I can honestly say that this is as good of a "sequel" as one could have ever possibly hoped for, barring Alan Moore's involvement. The creative team has taken the world of the graphic novel and used it as a springboard to create something completely new while maintaining the complexity, aesthetic and overall denouement of the original story. The soundtrack is stellar, the costuming, acting and direction are all top notch and those complaining about this not being "Watchmen" have probably not watched past the pilot and are missing out on a compelling Superhero story that appreciates the source material without attempting to copy or emulate what the Graphic novel already did so perfectly. If we're going to have new Watchmen stories then I would gladly take something like this over another weak, watered down retelling of the original graphic novel. This series only adds to the original and takes nothing away. The complaints about Rorschach becoming the symbol of racist extremists misses the mark as I see it more as a demonstration of how impressionistic people interpret other people's words in ways that justify their own twisted views. Just like a rorschach test. Yes, race plays a big role in the series but there is SO much more tackled as the series roles on. The alternative timeline, continued from the graphic novel, is very interesting and there are some great science fiction elements as well as very well choreographed action sequences with a strong tenor of suspense throughout the series. The new characters are engaging and feel natural to the Watchmen universe. I would definitely recommend reading the graphic novel before watching the show. (I'm not a fan of the movie). This show holds a dark mirror up to our society by using the symbolic nature of the Superhero genre, just as the original Watchmen did. Highly recommend. This show is great! Its not the original watchmen, but a continuation of the story. There are a lot of fun throwbacks and references to the original movie and comics. It also plays around with historical and political events, and portrays an alternate reality. It is carried out in an interesting and intelligent way. The episodes get better and better throughout the season. I would recommend this to anyone with an open mind, that is looking for a fun and creative superhero/sci-fi/fantasy show. Give this series time and you will be amazed. One of good series in a long time. Show is great. "Race" cards are not played here just the straight truth that I actually didnt know about. Some sick things happened that it feels like history books have covered up. Very well made show. Very good storylines. Dont let idiots tell you its anything different, and yes you are idiots because just like me you have been withheld information. I'll start by saying that I was a HUGE fan of the graphic novel and loved Snyder's shot for shot adaptation. I was VERY skeptical of the TV show. To start I haaated Lost. It was one of those TV shows that just wrote to keep the money train moving. They never had an ending in site and just made everything up as they went. I can't stand tv like that anymore (TWD being the biggest culprit now). However, what Lindelof did here was amazing. On day one, he had a beginning, middle and end planned for this story. That's how good TV should be. This was watchmen while still being completely it's own thing. It's a story that has very little to do with the graphic novel but has so many tie ins and easter eggs that it's definitely something I'll have to rewatch multiple times. It really captures that Watchmen feel/essence while being completely independent. I loved watching one episode every week, then thinking about that episode all week long. I also can't wait to binge the entire thing in one sitting. P.S. Regina King is amazing and always has been (I want more Boondocks). A makes some egregious assaults at the source material, but the craft and commitment to the long game is wonderful. Take it form what it is and you'll love it. Best show of the year, far better than the Snyder's movie. It is much closer to the comic than the film was and yet it has his own features that make it an original (and sadly actual) story.<br/><br/>Despite surely Alan Moore won't never see it, I think he would be proud of this work, an obscure love letter from Damon Lindelof.<br/><br/>You can love it or hate it, but I'm sure this is 2019's "must see" Incredible. I have no idea why one would give less than a perfect score. Absolutely brilliant in every way, from its young to mature actors, script, setting, photography, and social justice aspect. So much tapestry. I recommend this to all. Great show with a great sense of humor and many philosophical layers. It is not anti-conservative at all but it shows the weak points in every approach. It doesn't follow exactly the comics but it does represent its spirit. The most enjoyable for me was its sense of humor. To those who complain that it is not original Watchmen - no, it is the continue of it, several years later, Laurie , Adrian etc are older and facing new problems. Actually I think it is even more sarcastic and funny and more philosophical than the original comics or original movie. Very refreshing and well written series. It deserves minimum 8. Reason of low raiting is expectations from the title. Raitings would be higher if it was named other than "Watchmen". This show exceeded my expectations. It was extremely enjoyable, well written, and often surprising. It's not often that you find a show that creates so many storylines and is able to wrap them up in a satisfying fashion within a single season. Regardless of whether a season 2 will ever be produced, this piece of fiction stands alone as the best television produced in 2019. Excellent, ignore those giving a bad rating. They're morons. Well cast, good pace, engaging right from the start, visually well done. I'm hooked after a few episodes. There are so many plot holes in the show when you put it up next to the comic. Silk Spectre and Night Owl went into hiding so why is she now a federal agent. There are other plot holes like character location and timelines but I won't get into that. The show also gets rid of the ambiguity of the comics ending it's not specified if the fat kid really did publish Rorschach's journal. If you like the graphic novel I recommended you don't watch this. I'm not saying this because the show is "woke", I'm saying it because the graphic novel was already woke in a 1986 way. Watchmen is actually pretty good. But, i bored watching episode 1 until 4. After episode 4, everything become better, the plot story, the way they revealed the secret, the twists on some characters, etc. The acting is usual (except the main role, she did the best). But, the visual especially Dr. Manhattan are magnificent. Although, I thought Lady Trieu isn't evil enough to be the villain. Then, the last episode doesn't dissolve everything, and i am disappointed.. Hope the second season will much better I waited a few episodes before my review. Loved how eveything came together the more episodes I watched. We're at the penultimate episode. I'm glad I kept an open mind and made it to here. It's a 10. I'll fight anyone in the street who disagrees. Great follow up to the Watchmen story we are so familiar with. If anyone is interested in what happens after the events of Watchmen, read Doomsday Clock, which is clearly used as source material for the show. You can expect some great storytelling from HBO. Don't let what some of the trolls have been saying on here sway you away from seeing the show. This is a worthy successor to the celebrated graphic novel. Am not to sure in what direction there going with this. Story seems to be ok, but very focused on one character when you could of at least stuck in a few more for depth.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes are totally under par, could of done a lot better there, like seriously! But it's great. It's a sequel, so read up on the series, but it was wonderfully shot and has one of the best openings scenes to a show ever. Unless you don't want to face your own racism or the racist history of the US, then this show's absolutely worth it. Outstanding first episode. If this is indicative of the rest of the season then I'm sold. It's uncomfortable, it's complicated and it's worth watching. This show is weird. I felt like it started off weak and was ready to give up on episode one. Then, I decided to give it some time to improve and in fact they did manage to introduce and develop very interesting characters and ideas. There is an AMAZING episode in the middle of the season which convinced me the show was good.
Sadly, they totally screwed up in the end.
The story and the characters felt underwhelming and like the biggest waste of potential I seen. It was super unoriginal and lazy, which you'd think impossible given the weird first episodes everyone talked about.<br/><br/>Anyway, giving it a 6 because I had a good time for most of it. Anyone saying this isn't Wagchmen isn't watching. Its set 30 years after the comic/movie. Ozymandias plot is almost half the show. Doesn't get much more Watchmen than Ozymandias.<br/><br/>I think many of the negative reviews are people that don't want to watch anything that sheds light on politics they don't believe in. I like the build up. Every episode you learn more about the plot. I feel like there was a lot of hate(rs) when this premiered but every episode is proving this series is something truly special. Exciting. Weird. Intelligent. Topical. Unexpected. Mind blowing. A true tribute to the beloved graphic novel that was not immediately revealed. I just finished the 7th episode and cannot give enough praise to the writers and the overall vision. Watch the Watchmen & prepare to be entertained. Wonderful show. Truly great follow up to the original graphic novel. Does a perfect job of encapsulating the spirit of the comics and leaves you wanting more. Great imprassive have to evrey on see it.iam not joking Almost all negative critics were written after first episode (October 21), which was somehow special, as nobody really knows we're the show was actually heading. It is almost like judging a film after first 10 minutes, but worse, as creative "weirdness" of the show really take off after episode 2, Excellent effects, transitions, gags, cinematography along with great acting, great cast, writing and directing were made me enjoy show twice - first time alone and second time with family members. Chernobyl and Watchmen are my favorite shows of 2019. I really enjoyed this show! It's dark,but it kept me captivated. Bravo! What's the point to say.. A event that happend hundred years ago.. Character not used... Not my story.. A extreme..?<br/><br/>This was a story worthy of carrying the name watchmen.. If you don't get go watch dude where is my car Sinister, dark, weird, awkward, funny and spot on
1 episode. A good start
2 episode, I don't have the right emoji
3 episode 👍, can't wait for 4th<br/><br/>It's far away from the comics and the movie, but captures the spirit very well👏 Getting better with every episode, but I write this review after watching there only. I love the original comic book, and I love the movie adaptation. I struggle to tell which one was better. After the third episode, I started to be impressed how sequel series connects the dots. It's my first review here. I wonder if I will be modifying it after the whole season. The show is set in the same universe and continues and expands upon the implications of the previous, but is not a 1 to 1 adaption or part 2. I think being familiar with the source material will give you a richer viewing experience. However having watched the show with someone who is uninitiated into the greater universe I can say that there is more than enough here to have a fully engaging viewing experience.<br/><br/>Casting is excellent, which is what you can seem to expect from a HBO Drama (not a fan boy of HBO, but even shows i do not care for are consistently well cast). The script carries the same information thirsty-confusion from the comic, where you are dropped into the world and have to wait patently for, and sometimes work for, answers.<br/><br/>People saying the show is "Too Political" or "PC" I have a hard time believing ever read the comic or did so without any context for the time and place it was originally written in. The comic dealt with the issue of the time, namely power, truth, and morality in the context of the Cold War and the existential dread that went along with it.<br/><br/>The show deals with the current issues of our day through a similar looking glass. I will say if you are the type of person who watched Rocky IV in the 80's and said, "This is too political!" I would say skip this one you're looking for something entirely divorced from reality and this show is more of a Black Mirror to our present day, similar but darker. I think His Dark Materials looks like it will fill that service for you of a fantasy type drama.<br/><br/>Having been both a fan of the original comic and lesser fan of the movie I can say the tone is spot on to the sources and deals with similar themes in similar manner. I Have not been disappointed so far.<br/><br/>Give the show a watch and decide for yourself. High production, good actors ...... the show looks really good. However, this Pilot episode was boring. There might be a 'woke' agenda brewing. Not yet sure what the writers are trying to achieve but then again, it's still the first episode. P.S. the music is bad, just bad. I started watching this show on hotstar and i really liked it even though the show is not much content with the actual comics , then i checked the IMDB ratings and shocked to see it as 6.1 and now when i am writing this review the rating is 7.4 and i am sure the ratings will cross 8.0 till the season one comes to end<br/><br/>The people who were hating the show because this is not content with the comics , please watch the climax of episode 7 , you will find some good news :) These initial reviews from crybabies explaining that the show has nothing to do with the Watchmen graphic novel must have stopped watching after episode 1. I mean honestly episode one had the connection as well. Just finished episode 7 and at this point it is possibly the best series on right now. Even my wife who has no interest in comic book movies and barely watches TV in general won't let me watch this show without her. The plot and subplots and the world that has been created in intriguing and every episode that ends leaves me craving what is going to come next. Please ignore the ignorant reviews of the people that think a show displaying race relations is cliche as if it is a foreign thought in the world. I can go on and on but just watch the series. Probably the best show of the year, maybe it will go down as one of the all time greats. One thing for sure 5 episodes in and I'm hooked So they changed the backdrop from total nuclear annihilation, the demise of the superheroes in a complex political world and the common man in the middle of this carnage (Alan Moore) to racism?<br/><br/>It seems to me that the supposed plight of this generation is boredom , and instead of taking the big risks and combat the greatest foes, they invent little stories of fighting ghost like racism or fascism where they are the heroes and everyone is the villain.<br/><br/>Where Alan Moore and to a certain extend the 2009 adaptation go for both big and personal subjects, this series goes for the fluff and superficiality. Does the graphic novel justice. It is more than a movie ever could have offered. Amazing character costumes and subplots. Acting and choreography. Script is very good. It has a strong and compelling female lead. I wasn't interested in watching this series. I enjoyed the 2009 movie version and didn't think they could match the thrill of the movie with the series. Well, thank goodness a colleague of mine insisted I check it out! I'm up to episode 8 now, and I can't wait to see episode 9. Awesome series. I'm not willing to say which is better: the movie or the series, but I strongly feel that they complement each other very well. I would say as a big fan of the graphic novel, i kinda disliked the first episode, but i don't judge series before watching at least 3 episodes and after credits for the third episode started rolling, i was deeply invested and it just kept getting better and more in line with the comics from there to a point i gotta call it a masterpiece. Don't miss and definitely don't misjudge this after just one episode. This series is a real work of art. with aspects that worship HQ and the film, while creating a new story true to the original events and also to the historical moment lived in the vast majority of human societies. It's amazing how showrunners have managed to build such a fertile environment to tell a story about the human race from a story originated in a comic book. definitely is one of the best productions of HBO. great soundtrack. great performances. great special effects and action scenes. that sediment an engaging story. 10/10. Don't read the negative reviews ! Judge for yourself! Can't wait to watch more episodes! A real rollercoaster of a ride, Watchmen is intense, clever, funny and very much in tune with today's problems, even if it's doing it from a totally insane alternate reality!<br/><br/>It grips from the first couple of episodes and keeps you hooked right to the end with characters that are interesting and rounded, helped along by a well-developed backstory about what leads us to this point (well told in a flashback form which meshes well with the story).<br/><br/>I'm waiting for season two with bated breath! If you feel like rewatching the classic Watchmen movie just for the sake of seeing what Dr Manhattan is up to, then you're in for a treat. This series is everything it promises to be and more... If you get beyond the boring first episode, things start unravelling and the mystery of what is actually happening starts to come to light. Wonderful philosophic pondering on what it's like to be a god and what do gods do when they get bored. Beautifully made episode 8 (my personal favourite) and a not so cool episode 9 that promises more to come from a potential season 2, but ends up being a bit of a disappointment in the near ending. The movie is a big thought experiment. Have fun with it. This is some of the most original TV I've ever seen. It's unpredictable but entertaining. The plot and direction are both confusing and yet engaging.<br/><br/>I've watch a ridiculous amount of TV and this show has stopped me in my tracks.<br/><br/>Fun facts: HBO has put out a podcast with the creator where they discuss the previous 3 episodes.
They have also given extra content online called peteypedia that helps fill in some none plot critical gaps and helps you sink deeper into the watchmen world. The story is intricately told and somewhat interesting, and the cast is excellent, but it is a slowburn. While there are no poor episodes, only a couple could be considered stand-out, and that is part of the problem.<br/><br/>With such a great cast, it seems criminal that the story (as it plays out) isn't more engaging or entertaining. Not sure what the missing ingredient is, a lack of heart or humour possibly, but I think there is definitely something lacking if not missing. It is likely due to the way the story is told. If the reveals feel lacklustre, you'll likely feel your time watching, was time spent poorly.<br/><br/>The story's greatest strength is its reversal of (well worn Hollywood) stereotypes but over the course of the season, this is only diminished via explanation. Regina King, Jean Smart and Hong Chau are terrific but often this is in spite of the story. There is a lot of wasted potential. A little more comic relief via Russia's Red Scare would have been more than welcomed. I'm a comic book geek and have been since 1974, so that I'm sure may colour my view of this series, but I am loving it and it's getting better with every episode as the story slowly unfolds, just as the original comic did. I don't think anyone who is a true fan of the comic, and read it when it originally came out when it reflected so well the very real anxiety and worry about a nuclear war occurring in a way that hadn't happened since the Cuban Missile Crisis, could help but absolutely love this series. The plotting, the dialogue, the shots, everything has the feel of what Moore, Gibbons, and Higgins created back in those days in the 80s before the fall of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>To all the people apparently grievously hurt because the show is holding a mirror up to the present anxieties gripping American society is the ultimate irony because that's *exactly* what Moore did with the original comic. It's not just the height of irony, but of hypocrisy (and, well, just plain stupidity possibly as well if that's the sole basis of why some folks are writing "This isn't Watchmen" and giving a slew of 1/10 reviews... really? 1 out of 10, ranking this about the same as "My Mother The Car". Pffft. If you want to take a look at something and think this isn't a proper sequel to Watchmen, just look at what DC did with their current comic sequel, "Doomsday Clock". Oy yoy yoy, what a convoluted and contrived mess that is, but that's another story.<br/><br/>You can tell with every shot, every scene, that the creator's of the HBO series are true fans of the original in the way they captured the spirit of it so perfectly. I also love that there are so many easter eggs packed into the show that viewers of the the 2009 film (which I liked, but didn't love) wouldn't get, only readers of the original comics. It's like a little bonus from one group of fans, the creators of this series, to another, fans of the best comic to ever hit the stands, period. I was skeptical until episode 3, it seemed random, and at episode 8 it just blew my mind! Won't give spoilers, have patience it will all make sense, it's like a really good novel, give it time to unfold it's brilliant. This show is seriously one of the best made in a while. It helps if you know the comic, but you'll enjoy it either way. Such a very dark world (that's DC) and such a good cast to bring it to life. Each episode sucksnin deeper and deeper. Production and acting is pretty good. Visually it looks good! And it might be interesting if show is not Watchmen.
I read Watchmen, and it doesn't feel like something i read over and over and love that much. It is a mimic of graphic novel.<br/><br/>Narrative is not that good. Maybe they didn't have to make another Watchmen project. It feels like they are trying to mimic Alan Moore's writing style. Which is very lame if you ask me. It feels in moments that they took idea from graphic novel and turned it in something new, but not as good, because they lost point of it. They are trying to catch audience by hinting old characters. Even a Watchmen movie isn't that good comparing it to a graphic novel because they missed some really important things in it.
If you want to continue story, leave old characters behind. Write something entirely new.<br/><br/>And " If you don't like my story, write your own" feels like they are making excuses.<br/><br/>Just write a TV show with original ideas. Alan Moore is not credited because he doesn't want to be part of it. Because his story was already told in graphic novel and it doesn't have to be on screen.<br/><br/>Just because Rorschach's left that diary in the end of Watchmen graphic novel it doesn't mean that we need to see what might happen, it just didn't have that point! So that means that last point writer gave is misunderstood in this case, but intentionally. I just don't see it that way. Some people doesn't know where it ends.<br/><br/>If Alan Moore wanted to continue writing Watchmen he would do it.<br/><br/>I will watch it till end of first season just because I started. But no more. At first this series felt a bit pretentious and tedious, but it got better, even exellent. I give it 8 for overall quality, and one extra point for celebrating the complexity of human life in a challenging, whimsical and thoughtful "watchmen way". The best comic implementation I've ever seen and probably will. I would give 20 out of 10 points. All the negative reviews are clearly from those who harbour xenophobic thoughts and are probably white nationalists, who deny their own privilege. The fact they can not even bare to watch a show, which is challenging and (initially) highlights social inequalities, renders their opinions and reviews completely meaningless. It is clearly butt-hurt white folks,
that are upset about the idea of supremacists being the villains in the early episodes. Just watch the show and base your opinion on the quality of the narrative and the twisted world of 'Watchmen'. I promise you after episode 5, you will be hooked! Every once in a while there comes a show that is so layered and meaningful that it will be loved by many and discussed for years. The Watchmen is that show. Smart, sexy, romantic, intriguing, beautiful, ambitious, clever, cunning are a few adjectives. I refuse to define it because definition is the death of discovery. What I will say is watch it. This show was a brilliant and beautiful follow up to the complex original story; which turned a genre on it's head. A story about trauma and the rectification through love - in the most non-corny, fantastical way possible, while also being rooted in the center of our humanity.<br/><br/>Doesn't seem to be everyones cup of tea, but I'm floored. Thank you for telling this chicken or the egg story about how god was reborn as a Black woman in Tulsa, Oklahoma.<br/><br/>Also, why are all the negative and middle of the road reviews laced with racism? You all need to check it. I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying people are tired of "social commentary" in their films/TV, unfortunately these people seem not to realise that Watchmen has been political since it's first issue, and if that's lost on them, then obviously this series will be as well.
Whilst the whole series has been incredible, the penultimate episode is one of the best love stories I've seen all year.
True to the characters of the graphic novel, and probably quite an accurate depiction of an America so distraught by a more recent disaster, that it had time to forget the Holocaust. He got a low rating, thanks to so-called "purists", who think the series should be the same as the comic. Comic is fantastic and I adore it, but I also like the series. The real rating it deserves is between 8 and 9, I I rated 10 as a compensation for an unfairly low rating. Longtime Watchmen fan. I enjoyed the movie even with the changes. This series does not continue from the movie. It is a sequel to the original comic.
I'll be honest, the first episode left me with a lot of questions. Things seemed confusing. Unfortunately most of these bad reviews came after 1 ep and are mostly complaining about 's, pc culture or that the story is political. If you didn't see politics in the original, then I don't know what you were reading. Watchmen has always been a slightly distorted reflection of us. So it's hard for some to see themselves in the light.
Seriously, keep an open mind and give it a try.
Without giving any spoilers, as the series progresses, it completely ties into the original comic with some familiar faces and lots of easter eggs. Lindelof is at it again with his imaginative storytelling. I only knocked off a point because HBO haven't said that the story is over and the premise of the characters' power is impossible (at least for my simple mind) to understand. I just hope they don't run this masterpiece into the ground if it is kept going.<br/><br/>Masterful. I ended up watching the whole show, despite being somewhat hard in the beginning because of the non-interesting first 4 episodes, and I'm glad I did. This show has a slow beginning due to the introduction of lots of "dots" which never seem to get "connected", but that is not the case. This show ends up majestically grabbing all those "dots" and "connecting" them in an incredible and genius way that leaves you amazed by the result. While still being completely loyal to the comics, which I truly appreciate.
I really recommend you watch the wole show if you have the time for it, its not even that long anyway. It's a shame that people gave up watching it, because it's absolutely worth it!
Thank you. Fantastic story telling, impeccable timing, balance of slow and fast paces; Watchmen is an unfiltered look into a brutal world. Don't be distracted by those who are blinded by the "good and bad guys" and think this is some sort of "woke, agenda pushing commentary". Watchmen is on par with GOT and Breaking Bad in terms of production and story, and it's a shame that it doesn't have the 9+/10 rating it should. Screw the pilot and all the episodes until 4. Yeah you don't understand much but later it all comes to a great jigsaw puzzle. It's worth your time. It delivers great. Just see it. Unusual, but interesting. Totally different. The way the screenplay is broken so that each episode tells a different story is nice. Good choice of actors. People, don't hate this because it's not like the film!<br/><br/>I'm only going to write the problems in regard to comparing this to Zack Snyder's own 2009 film version of "Watchmen".<br/><br/>Firstly, Snyder did not stick to the original Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons story. He made the characters more superhero like including costumes. This TV series keeps the original Watchmen/Minutemen costumes as they were in the comic, most evident with Adrian Viedt/Ozymandias. His costume is identical to the original artwork. Viedt in the comic was nowhere near as cool as in the film, where he's portrayed as a "Super Bowie" type character (He even wears similar clothes to David Bowie circa "The Man Who Fell To Earth" period).<br/><br/>I am a fan of Zack Snyder's directors cut of the film.<br/><br/>A giant squid was dropped on Manhattan by Ozymandias in the original story & that is what stopped Thermonuclear war, not Dr. Manhattan! So this TV sequel is staying true to the original story.<br/><br/>And now I can add, Viedt was true to the original comic character as being narcissistic, arrogant & with a god complex in regard to his own destiny!<br/><br/>No one can say this isn't true to the film when the film isn't true to the original story anyway!<br/><br/>The film did not even give the great Alan Moore a credit! What's that all about?<br/><br/>I still have all my original twelve "Watchmen" comics, I brought from from new, from 1986 & 1987. This TV series is more in line with these than the film ever was!<br/><br/>You cannot compare this to the original story set in 1985, as the threat of nuclear annihilation due to The Cold War is over, as it was at the end of the comic.<br/><br/>The Watchmen story always stuck to what was happening at that point in time & how things lead to that. This series addresses current issues which are happening everywhere.<br/><br/>So far I like what I've seen in this series, but I am only giving it a 8 as I want to see where it's going. I don't want another GOT 8 year waste of time! And HBO has a lot of bridges to rebuild after that whole fiasco!<br/><br/>I think the tension will rise once other characters realise Laurie Jupiter/Blake was there in 1985, at the South Pole. She was part of the whole conspiracy, to cover up Adrian Veidt's Psychic Squid drop on New York!<br/><br/>What will "Mirror Guy" think, if he's still alive? So far so good. It uses original content well enough as a base and builds up on it with it's own story. Which is sort of a pseudorealistic take around racism and politics in the modern US. Characters are still somewhat lacking but I'm only three episodes in.<br/><br/>Reviews saying this series has "nothing" to do with the original Watchmen are simply false. It's basically a sequel in the same timeline 34 years after the original. Even some of the characters make an appearance. You have to remember that the original was also highly political at its time touching on things like Vietnam, the cold war and WW3. ... well, I must say, I like this show so far, and I'm curious about what comes next.
I have seen the old movie from Zack Snyder, which I really like, but I don't know the comic, so I can watch this open-minded.
As I read in some news, this show is not intended to be a screen adaptation, but something new just based on the comic. I can live with that, if the show is good. Well, let's see. Having read the graphic novel many times, if I wanted something almost identical to the source material, I'd just re-read the comic, or maybe even watch the movie.<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of negative reviews, but then again the internet does give all the negative closed minded complainers an avenue to complain.<br/><br/>This show is truly fantastic. When I finish an episode, I'm left wanting more. If you go into a new episode with any preconceived notions of what to expect, think again. Even readers of the comic don't know what's going on sometimes or what's going to happen. Which is sensational!<br/><br/>10/10. Hands down. 11/10 even. This is just so good love it 🤘🤘🤘🤘 I say don't miss this one. "This is not like the comics!"
"This is not like the movie!"
Are two complaints about this show you will likely hear a lot. Neither are relevant.<br/><br/>This is a continuation in the spirit of the comics. And it's precisely why it's worth your time. Unlike the soulless page for page movie adaptation - all style, no substance - this show knows its roots, understands its roots and honors them, but without feeling like just a copy, another attempt to do something unachievable on a screen. It knows things change with the medium.<br/><br/>The showrunners know the source material, they understand it, and have crafted a believable continuation that borrows from the comics but is not the comics. This is inspired and influenced by Watchmen, but steeped in the real past, as well as the real present. It's a brilliant "What if?", to frame in something familiar to comic book lovers.<br/><br/>It's a confident show that does well in balancing flash and substance. Race, bigotry and brutality are a big part of the substance (and this is likely to expand). There is action, there is humor, even if mostly dark, and, especially important, there is Jeremy Irons!<br/><br/>When the world looks up and shouts "Who watches the Watchmen?", we should look down and whisper "We do." So many negativ review and most of them derailing. People complaning about it's to American... Well news flash, it is made in America. I am from Norway and if i made a movie guess what it would kinda be a "Norwegian" movie... Not eastern Europe to suit them. If you dont like it, tell your country to make movies relevant to where you live. Over to the movie. What can i say, awsome to see Don Johnson again and Louis Gossett Jr, and Jeremy Irons. Actors are good, the plot... Unclear at the moment but hey... 2 episodes what do people expect? I get a "sin City" fealing when i Watch it and its in a alternativ timeline compared to our own, No right or wrongs so if you dont get that you should stay away from the Fantasy genre. I like it so far, different and i like the actors. I read all the negative reviews and maybe its because I wasn't big into the comic book story but this series bring something new and very interesting as far as current culture, future tech, and human dimension. If you are a "fanboy" then you probably wont like this show but if you never really followed the comics then this will be full of surprises.<br/><br/>The 3rd episode with the negotiation had me out of my seat. The racial tension, and story so far have been amazing and this is definitely worth a try! Love it. It's so fast paced and all small pieces work together to make the larger machine oily. Im someone who has never read the comics or had prior exposure to Watchmen. I find this show to be a visual and auditory page turner. I read Watchmen roughly 30 years ago while I am in college. I was a foreign student and not familiar with America pop culture. I thought comic was for children and I was dead wrong. In addition to Watchmen I also read the Sandman by Neil Gaiman and I became a devoted fan. I think Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller and others have demonstrated to the mature readers that graphic novels can be equally profound and sophisticated.<br/><br/>2009 I watched the Watchmen movie, it was an adequate adaptation but did not add too much to the original work. I was happy to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Then this TV series has added multiple layers to the original universe and made it interesting. It was great fun to take Alan Moore's story for a ride and came up with an original story. My hats off to Mr. Gibbons and thank him for an enjoyable season of fun! From episode one they had me... Honouring the original comics in theme, this story follows the aftermath of the movie (with a slight retcon). With a compelling backdrop, and tales layered on one another through time, Watchmen will have you hooked. Once off the best shows I've seen this year. Best show of the year, far better than the Snyder's movie. It is much closer to the comic than the film was and yet it has his own features that make it an original (and sadly actual) story.<br/><br/>Despite Alan Moore surely won't never see it, he would be proud of this work.<br/><br/>You can love it or hate it, but I'm sure this is 2019's "must see". Prettty please. Please do another season. There wasn't enough Looking Glass. What about Topher with the glint in his eye as he walks through the bakery. The eggs. I think this was my favorite show - EVER. Absolutely amazing from beginning to end. Well produced, well written, well acted I am more right leaning then left. Especially in movies and tv, but that tv show doesn't have that annoying "look all the white folks are evil" vibe. And btw showing mass murder by kkk is what? Liberal agenda? Kkk are nice people? And racism is not the center of the tv show. It's something else entirely. But you have to watch more then one episode to understand that This show is so good. Everyone knows watchman is political. I was hooked since the first episode. A Must see! Must watch. A unique action thrilling mysterious tv show. First few episodes are not thrilling but when the thrilling hit the show it becomes something else. Some trashy people is trying hide this tv show because it shows the bad side and against of white supremacy. Must watch. i do recommend it. 8/10. Not finding it entertaining at all. I am a huge fan of the movie and was looking forward to watching the series. I find it very boring. Best part is when they show Jeremy Irons for 5 minutes an episode. Anyone with half a brain know Damien Lindelof very slowly likes to spoon feeds the audience.. So just relax and watch the whole show before you fan boys freak out.. Each episode is better than previous one.
It's fresh. The show evolves after 30 years of the graphic novel. Of course it doesn't follow the novel. Why people are complaining about comic accuracy when they didn't followed in the first place. Almost stopped watching this show, but then it became better and better. I like how they play with documentary scenes, black and white scenes, old school music from the '20s. This show pictures the times passed and is still packed with action, suspense and good characters. The episode that got me back to watching this was No. 3, so give it a looksee and decide on your own. To the creators, do not worry, quality is so, SO rare these days, this show will surface again. I have never seen in the past, a series having such a take off after the first 2 episodes. It was an unexpected blast. The characters were developed slowly and patiently, the background stories were untangled gradually during the latter episodes and the spiralling of old and new characters into the story was ideal.Tbh while I was watching the first 2 episodes I was afraid that we would see something that was loosely based in the well know main story of the watchmen universe. GUESS AGAIN.
My only protest for this show is the one I have for all the shows in todays industry. The makers keep trying to include percentages of different social or racial groups trying to indulge and please more and more people . But when something is not done gracefully and is awkwardly obvious , it has the exact opposite result.
Political overcorrectness, the disease of todays society.... I was surprised that the content revolves around today's American political climate. Surprisingly, it all works out really well. Awesome show. At the core of the Watchmen comic and movie was a moral conundrum: whether the secret use of great power by individuals is ever good or justified. I would argue that you can't justify making a series about Watchmen without this conundrum at its center. It's not worthy of being called "Watchmen" if there are clear good guys and bad guys, and Watchmen (2019) fails in that aspect.<br/><br/>The racism theme that the creators injected into the series feels like an uninteresting distraction with one dimensional characters attached. The original characters are neglected and watered down sociopathic versions of themselves, as are many of the new ones. Also, leaving little hints of what's to come in future episodes is not necessarily good storytelling. Massive props for finishing the joke, though.<br/><br/>All this wokeness BS aside, it's still a pretty good seres, I guess. Just not what I was looking for, and I know many others are also disappointed. As soon as it began I knew certain people would leave 1 star review and it filled that expecation.<br/><br/>I have seen watchmen movie and this show is pretty good in comparison. There is tension and same kind of storytelling which I enjoyed. Even if you haven't seen the movie you can still check it out.<br/><br/>I have only seen few episodes and hopefully this won't let me down and I can give it more stars by the end.<br/><br/>Edit: After watching eight episodes I can finally say that this is a great show! and I'm giving it more stars. Was expecting the unexpected based off articles about this but I just couldn't get into it. No sense of connection to the Watchman movie (which is in my top 10 all time). I (unexpectedly) loved the leftovers too (Lindelof) so was hoping this would pleasantly surprise me... It didn't.
I honestly don't know the source material at all.. some say it fits & others say it doesn't so Idk. I'm a democrat but will probably be pegged as a right wing troll-bot for not liking this. More & more
"critically scorned"= Gem (ala chapelle)
"critically acclaimed"= Overrated<br/><br/>4/10 just cause I like Regina King & Don Johnson This show is ridiculous. The story is so poorly written, and poorly executed, I am really disappointed. for HBO show. I don't know where to start really, this look like show for four years old. All the costumes, all the machines that they using, technology, like we are back 1850.And I have watched all 9 episodes hoping that will get better, that there is some hidden message, or something. But, my recommendation is not bother your self as i did, if you don't like the first episode, you will not like the rest of them for sure. Watchmen comics are centered around superheroes and their dark psychology in the most realistic way possible,this series perfectly captures that. I'm a fan of the original movie, but didn't read the comic. So I don't know how the orginal writers told the story. This given, I had a hard time following the first season of Watchmen, because most of the episodes I felt like been left in the dark, and kept wondering if this will ever clear up.<br/><br/>Well, it does, but you'll need some patience and just accept what they'll throw at you. One episode per week wasn't helpful either; I guess it is more pleasent to follow if you just binge watch it. In the end, it turns out to be pretty good, but I would prefer just a little bit of more continous storytelling for the next (?) season, which could push my rating to a 9.<br/><br/>Give me another season, I'm curious. This is an amazing show. Familiar with Lindelof's work, I was initially worried that he was going to drag the many mysteries in the pilot and never give any satisfying answers. But I must say, quality TV. Regina King is an entire force, Jeremy Irons is perfect. The nods to both the original graphic novel and Snyder's movie are great. A lot of angry fanboys have clearly been review bombing talking about how it's too political  targeted. I find these criticisms ignorant at best and stupid at worst. The Alan Moore comic was one of the most political comic books of its time in a genre which has always been political. This show just happens to reflect the relevant politics of this era and if that makes you uncomfortable then you need to deal with your own racial biases in your own time and stop trashing excellent tv. Anyone who enjoyed the movie or just about everyone who likes mystery intrigue and a damn good story,
This show is so good dare I say one of the best of 2019, hbo have knocked it out of the park yet again, the story is excellent and the characters are brilliantly written and fleshed out
All I can say without spoilers is if your a original watchmen lover or a newbie to the watchmen world you need to check this show out.
Up there with GOT and Westworld, truly amazing imo. 6 episodes in, this could be an interesting story with 3 episode left. A slow moving plot with a very left leaning bias. If you wanted to rekindle a race war, this is the way to do it. The production, actors, CGI, etc. are great. I just don't approve of something so obviously intended to muster violence and genocide on a massive level. This series is like Hitler's plans to rule the world but warped. Like most characters in series/films now, there is almost nobody one can identify or like in it. Everyone is a liar and everyone is a murderer. Unfortunately the authors of this mess felt that deconstructing society was the only way to 'fix' it. We are animals and we operate daily on more civil levels of consciousness trying to push back our base desires (murder, mayhem, hatred). If our society functions because we navigate through those emotions by being somewhat superficial and generous, then it is for the good of all we continue doing so . This is the breakdown of civilization going on here and really reflects the most disturbing notions and movements that are happening in our world today. I don't hold much hope for mankind. Perhaps, considering how we've treated the world, our time here is over and we need to let nature choose another species to flourish? Perhaps people really are NO damn good? This show deserves a fair chance, because it's getting better with every episode and in the end everything actually makes sense. This show rocks, I love everything about it. The first episode absolutely hooked me and I watched all the other episodes in one day. The story is written so geniously with all the extremely long exposition parts and how it makes the story so much better and then how it all comes together in the final two episodes. It's just masterful. The social commentary is also totally not annoying contrary to what people say. If you get offended by people in masks because you're white I think the problem's with you. Actually, the politics make it way better because it only enhances the story. The production design, cinematography and especially the music are all amazing. The acting was also excellent.
My only slight negative is that the pace decreases quite a lot after the first episode but when you get to the end it's all worth it so it actually isn't a negative but maybe it could turn you off or something. An incredibly powerful thought provoking take on the Watchmen and what happens next. I'm all for fantasy shows but this is big much. Catapult a guy to the moon. Raining squid. Nothing makes sense. It's time for some explanations of all these oddities. It's a sequel to Watchmen, but really its more like a story set in the same universe, later, and it's mostly centered around a new character, Angela Abar. The writing is done very well here and the acting is great. I didn't like a little bit of the CGI towards the end as it looked a bit fake but other than that the CGI and FX were good. The show does end up being overall a story about good vs evil and it's not morally ambiguous like the original Watchmen graphic novel but its still pretty good. I think that Watchmen 2019 is a rather hard show to digest.<br/><br/>It's not as complicated with its ideas (as the comic book was) but it is a show that really will challenge you as a viewer/or fan.<br/><br/>I think it works as a reactionary Rorschach test in many ways, in regards to political agendas of today, and actually challenges a lot of the attitudes of comic-book elitists within the 21st century. Its a show that rewards you for allowing yourself to be engaged with its core choice of story-telling, and allowing yourself to think a little more about WHY these choices may have been made. I also found that after watching the show and re-reading the comic-book it gave me a lot clearer perspective on the moral frame-works of these characters within the OG watchmen. And because of these reasons, the show decides to dump you right into the deep end with its politics, characters, questions and mysteries. it WILL loose you on its first episode, it WILL make you maybe confused with choices made but it DEFINITELY does try and answer your questions.<br/><br/>This is NOT the squeal you where expecting.<br/><br/>Watchmen gives us more insight to the world within watchmen after the events of the 1985 squid Armageddon dropped by Ozymandias at the end of the comic. This world created is not the utopia our hero intended. Whilst immediate physical threat of the Russians has been defeated, and we have found a supposed world peace. This has not lasted, with Rorschach journal being published to an Alt-Right conspirator news agency many different white supremacy and hate groups have been formulated, fueling existing hate organisations.<br/><br/>But this isn't what we are told, or start with<br/><br/>We start with Angela Abar in Tulsa Oklahoma, as we learn of the Black wall-street massacre as the police force are tracking down the Seventh Calvary, a white supremacist movement that use Rorschach masks to hide there identities. And from this point on the plot progresses to be a true squeal to the watchmen formula. There is A LOT to unpack within the general narrative, that is spoiler esc. But after having that first paragraph its not very difficult to see how an alt-right group wold formulate within this setting and world.<br/><br/>Damon lindloft understands what was set-up and seen within the original watchmen text. Emphasis on 'seen'.<br/><br/>The watchmen comic's general narrative is quite easy to follow. We watch events unfold and understand the stakes and moral complexity of the situation. But here is the thing, it is a comic book median, comics use not only written devices to tell there stories. If you are not paying attention to the background, colors, visual presentations and what is being shown to you, the reader, you well miss (strangely) a lot of the political leanings, agendas and meaning behind watchmen. Images within a comic-book aren't just complementary to the story, they are a key component to the narrative.<br/><br/>Damon understands 'comic-books' he gets how this median works, and how meaning and symbolism is presented. By this he does a lot of justice to the thematic of watchmen. Watchmen is a comic about people, about their fears and anger and disgust with this world. About there moral extremes and political agendas.<br/><br/>What this show lacks tho, is maybe a solid conclusion. Questions are answered, but the exposition in the final episode really sort kills a lot of the momentum. Its a show that really needed a good solid 10 episodes, instead of nine, to wrap up this story.
Also somethings are a but anticlimactic, and don't really get the emotional pay-off that was needed. But the journey to that point is excellent.<br/><br/>With that, watchmen 2019 is a worthy squeal to the comic that is absolutely worth sticking with. You well confused, shocked and angry. Which is good. So was I when reading watchmen.<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy it, fair enough. But i honestly enjoyed my time with this and don't really want anymore. This is more then enough. Just watched the last episode. I was unsure to begin with with episode 1. But I gave it a chance and I'd say after episode 3 and 4 I was hooked. My brother said he'd heard bad reviews. But I have now told him to give it a chance. Totally worth a chance. This is a disturbing, complex, amazing series. I only hope enough people with the ability to appreciate it, notice it. Loved it!! Keeps you glued the entire show because you are still trying to connect the dots while watching it! Loved all the connotations and artistic ways of speaking on certain issues in today's society! My boyfriend and I binged watched it and that means a lot because he won't just watch anything! If you haven't checked out yet go right now Great acting and loved the storyline. The low reviews are from people who hate acknowledging the history of race relations because it makes them uncomfortable and defensive. I read a few reviews and I am amazed at how people judge negatively after 1 or 2 episodes. If you are a fan of the original graphic novel, you understand immediately that it will be a complex show. From the beginning I knew this was a show that would not be a simple show about good guys or bad guys. It is a show that makes you think. It is a show that gives you hints to a puzzle being put together piece by piece one episode at a time. It has very interesting characters with interesting backgrounds. Some people will be turned off by the social commentary, however even that is not as simple at it seems. I absolutely love it. If the final episode is the final episode, I will be happy and sad....truly bitter-sweet, however more sweet than bitter. I suffer a lot with attention deficit disorder, thus find it extremely difficult to watch certain shows as i totally lose interest. I feared this would be the case after the first episode. But as i continued through the episodes i found myself totally 100% hooked. The stories interlink very well with each other. Dropping bombshells that totally puzzel you but leave you wanting to watch the next episode to find out what on earth is going on. With someone with such a short attention span as myself. This is truly a series not to be missed. ( i would recommend you watch the film first though) When it was first announced that Damon Lindelof would be helming a TV adaptation of Watchmen, I dove headfirst back into the original book I had loved as a teen. I may be a little biased as a Watchgeek, but I find that this version gets so much right on so many levels, and manages to cover territory the comic never did.<br/><br/>The graphic novel's ending will send every reader into a frenzy, guessing what could possibly come next. Thankfully, Damon has clearly been thinking about this for 30 years. To boot, Lindelof has assembled a crack team to do justice to the book, while making it accessible to a wider audience.<br/><br/>When adapting any Alan Moore property, you're expanding on the work of a very meticulous, devoted, and wonderfully weird artist. This show propels the already prophetic comic further into the 21st century, and gives the audience plenty to chew on about America's ugly past.<br/><br/>The new characters are a blast to follow, and the show is a flat-out triumph for representation. From Regina King as the kicking Sister Night, to Hong Chau as the affable, mysterious Lady Trieu, there are no lightweights here. This show feels so much like its own thing, yet it fits snugly into the Watchmen canon, and augments it in mind-melting ways.<br/><br/>The returning characters are portrayed with deeply satisfying depth, and Jeremy Irons' performance/subplot is one for the books. Just as the OG comic was a response to the complacency of superhero comics in the '80s, this show is a refreshing HBO answer to the Super-Cinema that dominated the 2010s.<br/><br/>My only gripe with Watchmen is that I wish there was more. One essential comic character is absent, and I feel they could have easily worked him in if there were a couple more episodes. The original comic had 12 issues/episodes, while the show has 9. Additionally, one character's arc is ended rather anti-climactically, but it works to serve the greater story.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this show to anyone who liked the book, or even the 2009 film. The world building takes a while to sink in, but it's oh-so worth it. The atmosphere is engrossing, the acting is stellar, and the message is unforgettable. Who watches the Watchmen? You should. Now. I started off so confused wondering what on earth was going on, but I always have a rule when I watch a new tv series I give it until the 3rd episode before I pack it in.
I am so happy I continued watching. Honestly it gets so good and explains itself completely halfway through with twists you didn't expect but fully appreciate.
Don't toss away this show after the first episode. Power through it, you won't regret it. Those who say this has nothing to do with the Watchmen have no idea what they are watching! Great show, great plot, great acting!
Awesome job HBO! I want more... Great plot and acting. Tied the original movie characters (not all) into it. Highly recommended. You need to watch the whole season not just one episode. I went into this without much knowledge of the Watchmen universe and furthermore I'm not a person who usually enjoys superhero fiction. I am a big Damien Lindelof fanboy (showrunner on Lost, The Leftovers etc) so I thought I'd give this a go. The first few episodes were slow and steady but I found them to be of at least enough interest that I went away and read the original comic, which as promised turned out to be a near masterpiece. As this new season went along it became more and more apparent that it too, like the original, is a near masterpiece. It's rich in character development and exploration of its universe. It's full of exciting visual and musical choices and manages to be entirely self contained.<br/><br/>As a non-superhero story person I think this works as "an exception which proves the rule" for me. None of the superheroes (barring Dr Manhattan) actually have any powers - they're just vigilantes - and the series sets out to be an interesting take on why some people would want to be a vigilante, hiding their face to take justice and moral philosophy into their own hands, whether it's because the system has failed them, or because they're so narcissistic that they feel they have the right to personally dictate their own vision to the world. The one superhero who does have powers is essentially so powerful that he's a god, but owing to his ability to see all time, he's just as helpless as the rest of us to shape his destiny (maybe more so?).<br/><br/>Overall just a great very well crafted series with as much depth as it is entertaining. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a bit more thoughtfulness in their superhero fiction and who doesn't mind the more nebulous storytelling style of Damon Lindelof. Well written well acted well short.....amazing story....the none linear narrative we are given us good.....imersing First episodes were slow but it is getting better with every episode. From what I've seen so far besides some acting and writing issues and off the rails story that can be a bit confusing sometimes. It's a good show I'd say so far. 7/10 Most reviews of this show are either concerned with its source material, or Hollywood's political bias. I never read the book, and knew nothing of what watchmen was, nor do I allow myself to get roped into political commentary in a closed minded fashion. To me watchman is just a convoluted mess. There are so many alternate plots lines going on, and as each episode passes I care less about each one. I guy on mars, no wait, he's not on mars, or is he. Time travel,aliens, religion, wormholes, racism, mind control, propaganda, glorified violence, it's just too many themes for 1 show too me. Besides that, knowing the history of lindeloff to we really think in the end he will tie these things all together in some sort of satisfying way?? The acting and much of the scenery is very good, which is only reason I give it a 5, but I'm 7 episodes in and really could care less about what happens in the 8th or beyond... Just like to give very big credit to Jeremy Irons' performance as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias - his portrayal (and costume) was one of the things that was actually better than the movie version - hope he's back for season 2 along with Nite Owl. When I first read the reviews I was expected to be disappointed. But I was wrong, good storyline and some episodes was little to much out of the red thread. But overall great first season.<br/><br/>Don't expect to much of watchmen or more a watchmen/mystery kind of show. I'm not one for writing reviews but this show was incredible. It started out as very watchable but as the episodes progressed it turned out to be a very complex and multi-layered creation with excellent acting throughout and mystery at every turn. Give it chance to get going and see it through to the end and you will not regret it. The balloon has exploded. The magic has gone. Watchmen has been buried deep in the tv history. In future someone will pull it out from where you buried and give it the value it deserves. At that time, I will watch Watchmen with great pleasure. For someone who has never seen the movie or dabbled in the comic books, I still found this series wildly entertaining. It was interesting, incredibly put together, and kept me on the edge of my seat for all 10 episodes. The series is pieced together so beautifully, and watching all of the confusion and pieces fall into place over the course of the series is incredibly satisfying. Amazing acting, beautifully shot, and overall captivating, even for someone not typical into this "type" of entertainment. Slowly building, unpredictable, not super hero, so super hero. And by "fans", I mean the people who love and understand the source material, not the people who are rate-bombing this show because it talks about white supremacy. So I'm just gonna put some facts out there.<br/><br/>1.) This is a Watchmen series: Three of the four living Watchmen have huge roles in the show (I'm banking Nite Owl II is alive somewhere). Laurie Juspeczyk/Blake, Dr. Manhattan, and Adrian Veidt are portrayed incredibly, and I'm very thankful for that because I thought Malin Ã…kerman was bad in the movie and Matthew Goode was average. I like the movie, and I've seen it at least 10 times, but this show seems a little more focused on subtlety than getting those slow-motion snippets just right during the fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, the action in the movie was cool, but this show is so much closer to the book in tone, visuals, character portrayal, and multiple other aspects. Just because this is a continuation and not an adaptation doesn't mean it's not Watchmen. This show pays homage to the book and creatively builds onto its universe, and that's truly awesome because I'd take a sequel over a remake any day.<br/><br/>2.) Political, but definitely not preachy: Watchmen and V for Vendetta are regarded as two of the most politically-charged graphic novels of all time, and they were both written by the same guy. It's heavily implied in the book that Nixon had the Comedian assassinate JFK, and after that he had Dr. Manhattan basically wipe out the Vietcong, so it doesn't surprise me that this show speaks politically, but I was pleasantly surprised by what it had to say. The Cold War isn't as relevant as it was in the 80's, so this show decided to shift the conflict to a more modern one. Go figure.<br/><br/>3.) This is not SJW snowflake propaganda: I consider this separate from the argument that Watchmen is too political because it implies the show is more concerned with being politically correct than it is with telling a powerful story, whereas being political just means it talks about politically-relevant topics. I wouldn't watch this show if it used political correctness as a plot device because that's lazy writing and it annoys me to my core- but this show doesn't do that. I had my doubts before I started the first episode, and prepared myself for the possibility of a mediocre sermon about police brutality against the black community that would be an insult to my favorite book, but I realized almost immediately after starting it that I had nothing to worry about. This show doesn't sacrifice its writing for the sake of political correctness, it doesn't demonize police, and it actually provides insightful commentary on our country's racial tension, which I believe is good for our society.<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it, just watch the show for yourself and form your own opinion. Binge watch it. It's the best way. Episode 1-3 takes a lot of effort to watch but stick with it. All you Sci-fi fans will love it. Honestly.. I wasn't sure I was going to like this show. The trailer looked a bit like 'Arrow' and after the first few episodes... Well... I liked it, but it wasn't even close to the movie. Also, some of the characters felt a bit weak.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm writing this review to tell you: This show gets a lot better along the way and if you liked the movie you should definitely watch it!<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything and considering the awesome plot twists and revelations in the final few episodes, you should definitely avoid spoilers!<br/><br/>PS: Just go watch it and don't write a review if you haven't even finished the first season ;) I didn't like this show after the first episode, and didn't want to watch anymore after the third. It just seemed like a show that wanted to make things confusing in order to appear well thought-out and intelligent, but with no actual plans for tying it all together.<br/><br/>But I kept watching, and just wow, I was wrong. The story is incredible, and if you push on past episode 4, you won't regret it (not to say that the first few episodes are bad in any way, it just takes some time to build it up).<br/><br/>The reviews about reverse racism or whatever are just unfounded and silly. If you're looking for it, and you see a black cop beating up a white guy for no real reason, sure, you can choose to see that as "glorifying black-on-white violence" or whatever. So if you're worried about the white race being replaced, maybe this ones not for you. Outstanding show. It honors the source material while creating a whole new world. "If you don't like my story,then write your own" ~ ep 4<br/><br/>Most spin-offs eg Star wars, appeal only to loyal fanbases , but i was most surprised by this series. I have to say it is very entertaining, intellectually and comically- and judging by the extreme variance in ratings, quite divisive.
I wonder if that's simply a reflection of the current political war in the US, or due to a more fundamental malaise / philistinism - i don't know, but I suspect the later.<br/><br/>Clever writing will always cause strong reactions for its audiences, and i am pleased to have had the opportunity to witness the almost sublime madness that is Watchmen. A very different series, having just seen the last episode I would recommend that you stick with it.
I seriously thought about quitting after a few episodes.. but I figured it had more to offer.
The plot develops nicely and all makes sense in the final episodes, yes it's dark and not really like the movie .. I would say that I enjoyed it though and am glad I stuck with it :-) As the season started, I wasn't to optimistic about the direction of the show, especially with the altered story from the original movie, but as the season developed I have come to appreciate the series more. It will be interesting to see if HBO will continue the show or bail out before others can become fans. The first episode was quite intriguing not to mention the ending part. Then the series had hit a lowbar but within the 5th episodes, it becomes more interesting.<br/><br/>The unfolding twists will make you watch the episodes in one go.<br/><br/>And the 8th episode is one of the best episodes, i have seen in 2019. The direction and the unfolding events are unexpected.<br/><br/>I wasn't going to recommend the series to anyone but it would be cruel if I do that especially, spolier alert when we got to see the god in the universe of watchmen.<br/><br/>Regina King is amazing and she did a great job playing the cop role.<br/><br/>That's an amazing year for super heroes movies and tv series. And i hope the finale will be amazing as well. There is a lot of good in here. but a lot i didn't like as well. (1 viewing, 2/26/2020) Series is not what I expected, from watching the trailer. To much of drama! It was an ok show, it was more of a time waster than anything, didn't like the fact how an all powerful entity was defeated so easily. They had a few good parts, i watched the whole season thinking it would get better but it was nore of a drag than anything. From what I can gather, the plot is so big that there are several trails to follow in order to get to the big picture. I came for Regina and love of sci fi, though I haven't read the comics. I do not like being forced into the sex scenes. Why are there more close ups and no foreshadowing on gay sex scenes(episodes 5&6)? Is this show that desperate for a shock value? I get the race piece, but I'm still lost as to what exactly is going on. Well, so I just finished watching the season finale. Best show of the year in my book. I might even rewatch this if only to look for clues throughout the season. If you are on the fence on whether to watch this, I recommend taking a deep breath and let this show filter into your brain bit by bit. There's a lot of mind games and also just a lot to take in - both in pain and pleasure. The overall production is fantastic.<br/><br/>I do hope that the creators and HBO have figured out an overall trajectory for the whole show. I would hate for it to devolve into a money grab. I'm also worried about a Lost-like route from mystery to repetitiveness.<br/><br/>However, given the controversy so far I expect it to become more of a cult favorite. So enjoy this while it lasts! It's a season of giving. This show takes the comic and movie and brilliantly builds. I am excited to see season 2! This has nothing to do with the Watchmen comic and - unless you live in the US perhaps - the racial theme don't really make for a good an interesting plot in itself. A critique of contemporary US politics that is lost on everyone not living there. Interesting series, sometimes very slow evolving.It could be a knockout if it wasn't stretched out over 9 episodes. The soundtrack was bad. I mean really really bad. I must say, i really love the feeling and the atmosphere that they have created. The slight variations from our current timeline is shows in a nice way and gives an alien feeling that i like. Some of the characters are very likable and the universe seems fleshed out....<br/><br/>My problem is the overall plot. After watching a couple of episodes, you still dont really know what the bigger arc of the series is. Sure, there are some smaller plotlines that you follow and in the end, they piece it together somewhat. But very few things acctually happen throughout the story, mostly flashbacks. And you basically learn about the series main arc during the last episode, giving no real time to set up tension. **SPOILERS** That the chinese girl was the main bad-guy and has been planning to steal dr Manhattans powers all along is only learned at the last second, so when her plans are stopped you dont really care. It would have been more interesting to actually see her get the powers, but that would have been too interesting i guess. After the whole first season ends, basically nothing has been changed since the first episode. Only that the plot that we knew almost nothing about had been thwarted in the end.<br/><br/>It would have been more interesting if Adrian Veidt knew about this and had to get back in time to stop his daughter, so we would feel some kind of urgency. And even though the flashbacks fleshed out the universe, it was a bit too much when almost 25% of the episodes are flashbacks. Excellent writing with a great ending! I want a second season! This spends lot of time giving hints and clues, but it does not pay off any of them.<br/><br/>The reason the original comic is still talked about 40years later after its release is the fact it has a mystery and then a very big pay off the type of pay off that survive decades. This is just dumb is quite fun dumb but it fails at a key aspect.<br/><br/>Gave it a high grade since it fits my personal taste, subjectively it likely should have a significantly lower grade. This is some serious n quality product, non of the writers, producers, directors, & actors is horsing around. Its been really long time since i last watched a serious superhero adaption, I give them all the credit for that. It gets only 8 due to so much todays American internal politics. If you are new to the Watchmen world, you really should see the film before jumping into this series. If you don't you are likely to be confused.<br/><br/>In order to fully appreciate this series, you have to stick with it to the end. There are definitely a lot of questions posed on your way to the final episode, but they will all be answered by the time you get there.<br/><br/>Was this show perfect? No, is it for everyone? Definitely not. What I can say is that this series was crafted very well! The directors all did a great job! The actors were great! The music score, cinematography and overall vibe are all on point!<br/><br/>This show is a departure from the norm but in a good way!<br/><br/>The production team should be applauded! 👍 Wasn't a big fan of the movie. Find this a little too slow paced and not a big fan of the race war storylines, just seem done and trying to be too topical. Well directed and done just not cup of tea. I assume if you liked the movie or comic you'll enjoy this then. This show has a lot of potential if it continues and there are a lot of things to love about it but the first few episodes really hold it back. This show demonstrates that beautifully. While the comic was about the fear and anxiety of the 80's, this show is about today. The writing is clever and great series. Really wanted to love this but it's not good. It doesn't know how to handle the themes it tries to unsuccessfully tackle and overall the writing is an unfocused mess. Pretty lacking in vision for the show, tonally all over the place. Often the acting is bad, and talent is underutilized. None of the characters are likable and it's just laborious to watch. The Boys is a much better show, though it's not as racially charged and perhaps doesn't try to bit off more than it can chew as this series does. Mostly I was bored and not engaged -watching, desperately hoping for something to be legitimately entertaining. In light of recent events in the US this feels like it didn't age well at all. The show is full of 'woe as me the police aren't corrupt' nonsense. Numerous scenes of police brutality and civil rights violations actively blown off by law enforcement. Is it supposed to be a smart and sardonic take? Because it certainly doesn't seem that way. It seems like more super cop sympathizing against a backdrop of racism and white supremacy. But it doesn't work. We don't care about the characters. There's nothing to grab on to here. It's like it's faking substance because the writers know they are tackling something sticky and important but aren't smart enough or eloquent enough to have anything worthwhile to say. There aren't any redeeming lessons so far, nothing notable to be gleaned. Just a fancy decorated cake in a world of cakes.<br/><br/>One star for Trent and Atticus' music, one for cinematography, one for sound design- these elements elevate the show tremendously. Take them away and you really have even less of a sum of parts. Watchmen the series is an awesome work based on the graphic novels (which I didn't have the opportunity to read), so I truly don't know for a fact how much it does them justice.
What I can base my reviews on is the series itself and the 2009 brilliant movie.<br/><br/><ul><li>In relation to the movie, it lacks comparative shininess, truly smooth and directed flow of screenplay and storyline together with less memorable acting performances and gory actions.</li><li>Relational to itself, it has beautiful cinematography, well-told and interesting storyline, superb acting by the whole cast (Jeremy Irons, Jean Smart and Regina King shine above all), nice and satisfying characters development in general, well-made action scenes complemented with nice CGI &amp; visual effects, easy on the eyes.</li><li>Generally speaking, the series is so busy providing story telling, characters development and filler scenes that it forgets to do that in a connected way, aside some episodes, leaving viewers with sets of pictures and scenes woven into episodes, but missing the whole 9 episodes' general picture and rock-solid logic.</li><li>It depicts the most powerful existing character as inconsistent in logical behavior and somehow 'weak' in terms of his real use of his immense powers as it should have, possibly for the sake of what the writers had in mind for next episodes, which in itself is quite unacceptable.</li><li>It has back and forth fillers for Jeremy Irons' character, both in a temporal and planetarian way; although somehow interesting and sometimes funny (all to the credit of the superb actor that he is), they do not contribute strongly and as it should to that character's story and even weaken and belittle the character's power and importance throughout the episodes, creating and masterminding a possible grim fate for him. It may be good as far as it goes for the writers, as they know better, it is just that the whole thing doesn't feel how it should have evolved IMO.</li><li>The whole vibe of the show lacks smoothness and consistency in logic, which may be its weakest section.</li><li>Political issues and ramifications have already been explored by expert viewers. Nothing to add further on those.</li><li>At the end, we are presented with a sort of a cliffhanger, which is quite interesting in itself and deserves a solid greenlight for a second, hopefully shinier season.</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all, Watchmen definitely earned its high ratings, mostly because it didn't wander into cliche and cheesiness and kept a strong dark side, so valuable to the show.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the character of Dr. Manhattan would be more explored (real graphical background leading to gaining his powers and its near aftermath, more valuable development set in present and future in a possible season 2), as it definitely deserves that, no matter what, being one of the strongest focal points of Watchmen, if not the strongest.<br/><br/>Eagerly awaiting season 2! I tried and tried to get through it, was a slugging match by the end. Watchmen has so much potential the sets and CGI look great but it just boils down to being boring...very very boring. Not sure why reviews are so polarized. Show isn't enthralling but I manage to watch all episodes. I wouldn't recommend to friends, but I gave it a five due to some of the garbage shows I've seen from Netflix. When you watch the trailers and other stuff, you cannot be interested in this tv show, but when it comes to watching it.. It feels like Titanic. Everything that you've seen in trailer falls in the water, and a completely new things start to rise. A lot unexplained things for those who are not following the "Watchmen". You could've done this better, like the "Witcher" introduced new fans to everything very well.
