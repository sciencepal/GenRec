You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 times and I am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and I loved it and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performance of Paresh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances. This movie really makes me laugh. My rating- 10/10 Oh God how can anyone give Hera Pheri one star.
God damn it, they have not enough sense of humor to crack Jokes of this film.<br/><br/>See some nonsense foreigners are saying worse Indian movie ever. Dear bro & sis, If you really want to enjoy Hera Pheri learn Hindi first. Unlike other Indian film subtitle can't give Justice Hera Pheri. Surely they have ruined humor of dialogues. I have watched more than 100 times still don't get bore by hera pheri. It's the best comedy film of all time.
Must watch. Hera Pheri is a film set in Mumbai and is not your run of the mill slapstick comedy that directors like David Dhawan indulge in. The movie is directed by Priyadarshan who proved that after making such wonderful and serious film like Virasat, he can also direct a comedy with élan.<br/><br/>This film is a comedy of error. Set in a Mumbai slum where our three protagonists dwell, the movie depicts the hilarious moments created by the simplicity and/or stupidity of the characters. The look of the film is that of an art film. By the look of it, it seems as if it is going to be a really serious movie but it turns out to be one roller-coaster ride of laughter. <br/><br/>The cast of the film includes Sunil Shetty who plays an unemployed guy who comes to Mumbai looking for work and a place to live. He lands up at the house of a simple man played deftly by Paresh Rawal who takes Sunil in. However, there is another person living in the house, namely Raju. Played by Akshay Kumar, Raju is the mischief monger and good for nothing. He keeps on getting jobs and losing them quickly. The story is taken forward by a phone call by the gangster Kabira who keeps on saying that he has kidnapped his grand daughter (sunil takes the call) and wants ransom. This call kickstarts a mayhem. Which ultimately leads us to the climax of the film where the protagonists end up becoming millionaires. <br/><br/>Each and every member of the cast is brilliant in the performance of their roles. Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar's careers were in doldrums when this film released and both of them gave a stunning performance. Especially Akshay Kumar shows impeccable comic timing. Akshay Kumar is considered of the best comic actors of Bollywood these days after performing comic roles in films like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Khakee, Aawara Paagal Deewana and Waqt. <br/><br/>However, the show stealer is none other that the unbelievable Paresh Rawal who plays Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. He is an absolute delight to watch. It will be an understatement to say that he completely overshadows the rest of the actors with his marvellous portrayal of a poor Mumbaiyya simpleton. This film changed the course of his career and he is now reckoned as a character actor who adds to the star value of a film. <br/><br/>The music is not that good though. The song "Main Ladka Pom Pom" is hilarious though. The picturization keeps you in splits even though the song is irritating if you only listen to the audio. The real hero of the film is the dialogue writer Neeraj Vohra who comes up with some never before heard one liners. Anyone who wants another example of his great work must watch Aawara Paagal Deewana. In short, a film for every comedy lover. Some clean entertainment. Moreover, I can confidently say that this is the best comedy film i have seen in my life. Brilliant! Must watch in a lifetime.I love this movie.So much of extraordinary comedy of golden Indian movies are present in this one.Masterpiece of comedy Priyadarshan has a habit of making either extremely boring movies or extremely colourful ones, and I am happy to say that this is one of his finer efforts. This movie is a fun ride from start to finish. The characters are well projected and have a solid background, but more importantly the storyline is well written without flaws, which makes this clean comedy. Bravo Priyadarshan!!!<br/><br/>PS:Never thought someone would give a leading role to Paresh Rawal<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10 It is a light-heart old Indian comic , suitable only for the audience from Indian Sub-continent. My dear Non-Hindi speaking friends , its a good movie only if you understand Hindi . Does not make any sense for you to watch the movie dubbed in any other language ( as the comedy and timing goes well with the native language) because it is in TOP 250 list and then write a review that would be titled as "Spoiled My day " . No offense to anyone , everyone has their freedom to express their views like I did :)<br/><br/>I have seen many non-Indian friends complaining about this , thus writing this review . I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.<br/><br/>So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.<br/><br/>The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.<br/><br/>Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.<br/><br/>So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve. One tip though, don't think too much about the logic of the story or the probability. Just turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy. You'll find yourself cracking up every time you think of "Kabira speaking". Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean. Wow, This is what I call a great comedy in 2-3 hours, it will make you laugh as you are suppose to laugh.  Great acting by Paresh Rawal will make you feel that he is the best for the role given to him and he did justice with what has been given to him.  Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar has done there part very good, but I think the crown for the movie goes to Paresh Rawal.<br/><br/>A good movie, with good story and excellent comedy.  Its a must watch for people who like to enjoy there spare time. Talk of comedy in Indian cinema , and anybody would snap "Hera Pheri". This is one of the movies which make a permanent imprint on your mind and give you a lot to talk about. With snappy dialogs , impeccable story and a perfect combination of actors and actresses this is certainly a must see. With Indian cinema being crippled by the "HIGH" emotional dramas containing stories of ultimate suffering of impossible proportions, Hera Pheri was the turning point, where all the bollywood film industry saw the power of a simple comedy. Starring Paresh Rawal, Suniel Shetty , Akshay Kumar , Tabu , Asrani, Om Puri , Gulshan Grover Hera Pheri had all the ingredients of a super hit. If you hate Indian movies and are against all the high melodrama dose you get free with a DVD of Indian movie, Hera Pheri is just the movie for you. With a sequel now being aired "Phir Hera Pheri" which is too good for a sequel. Go watch both of these movies and have a big laugh. One of the greatest movie ever made in Bollywood, it fills you with laughter, joy. A cult classic. The movie that defined comedy in hindi cinema, a too good remake of an already good Ramji rao speaking! Hilarious, relatable, and actually deeper in it's relationships than it ever should have been. Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, and Paresh Rawal have perfect chemistry in this movie. I end up quoting it weekly, songs aren't the best but the main focus is comedy and the movie shines. Worth a watch You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 times and I am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and I loved it and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performance of Paresh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances. This movie really makes me laugh. My rating- 10/10 This along with Andaz Apna Apna are my most favorite Bollywood Comedy Movies. Every time I watch Heara Pheri I just can't stop laughing. The first time I watched it I couldn't sleep most of that night because I just continued to laugh on my bed.10 on 10 for me. Although I enjoyed other comedy movies of Priyadarshan like Hungama, Hulchul & Garam Masala and thought those were no less than Hera Pheri, but later when I watched those again they were not so funny as Hera Pheri. Akshay Kumar's acting was great but Paresh Rawal with his character Babu Rao is the one who steals the show, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Om Puri also played their parts well.<br/><br/>Hera Pheri I believe is a milestone in Bollywood because it showed that you don't always need a emotional romantic/patriotic movie to produce a Hit Movie. This movie started a much needed trend of Bollywood Comedies that relied more on stories, errors and confusions for its fun element breaking away from those cliché slapstick comedies of David Dhawan starring Govinda. <br/><br/>However the sequel to this movie Phir Hera Pheri I must say was disappointing, the first half was OK but the second half was really poor especially the circus scenes. That movie I guess lacked the Priyadarshan touch . Anyways there are talks about a third version of Hera Pheri and that I hope will be as funny as this one.<br/><br/>BTW this movie is a remake of a Southern Movie...So those who have a problem with remakes and also those who lack a Sense of Humor should stay away. From the first scene itself, you start laughing and keep until 'The End'. Strong performances by paresh, akshay and (even) sunil. excellent screenplay and a tight story. even the scenes like two highly desperate (sunil and tab) and unemployed struggling to secure a job inside a bank leave us laughing. Priyadarshan is really a brilliant director, crafting hilarious characters and instances from daily life. just to remind with a dialog: /*not include because written in Hindi and not accepted as spelling mistakes by IMDb*/(in English: a tenant beats up his landlord like a dog'(landlord babu Bahia alerted) 'reason - girls, babu Bahia, girls) and not to forget, nicely woven songs like 'denewala jab bhi data, deta chap par fa-ad K' add to the movie experience. Akshay kumar is best actor. All actor is best. Best comedy of bollywood. Best direction. Best screenplay. Best editing. Everyone knows that. No need to review this film. It's a masterpiece. Watch it now if you haven't watched it. It's a masterpiece. Hera pheri is one of my all time favourite comedy movie, all the characters and their dialogues are still remembered especially Paresh Rawal's role Baburao Ganpatrao Apte (one of the most highlighted characters of the movie) and the dialogues are really catchy "Khopdi tor saale ka", Kutria saala dekh ke number dial kar", "Aurat ka chakkar Babubhaiya", "Yeh Baburao ka style hai" "Khadak Singh ke kharak ne se", "Kabira speaking" and many more. Akshay Kumar is great, Sunil Shetty is also great and Paresh Rawal steals the show and the rest of the supporting casts are good too. The songs are good, screenplay is good, storyline is good and mostly direction is also good. It's one of those classic comedy movies like Andaz apna apna and Jaane bhi do yaaro<br/><br/>10 out 10 stars I love this movies. It is one of the best comedy film ever. You can not stop laughing after watching this movie. Whenever i watch dis movie it like im watching first time.
Dis is best comedy film that never made before.
Akshay kumar's brilliant performance as Raju nd Paresh rawal's dailouge nd comic timing, Sunil sir's Simplicity force me to watch it again nd again. Must watch for all. Don't miss it.
Baburao - Sam - Raju who can forget this iconic trio.
Watch it now with your family. All comedy fan knows, no one makes as good comedies as Priyadarshan does. and for me, this is the best comedy he has ever done and also best in Hindi cinemas. There are other old good comedies like goalmaal and angoor but this is better than all of those.. No doubt it took all the comic award in 2000. Any Hindi comedy movie fan must watch this.. Best movie ever. If you like this one then you will also enjoy Hungama by the same director and Awara Pagal Deewana. Paresh Raval is the best Hindi comedian in modern era. <br/><br/>Don't miss this movie.<br/><br/>10/10. I'm starting to think I simply don't get Indian humour. Every single comedy I've seen from that country has left me banging my head against the proverbial wall. But, oddly enough, this only applies when they're pure comedies. If they're comedic dramas like 3 Idiots or Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., I like them just fine. But if they're supposed to be comedy classics, they've left me cold.<br/><br/>Hera Pheri being no exception. The story is about these three dudes. Two vagabonds and good-for-nothings who are bunking with this third dude, their quote-unquote landlord. They're all suffering from poor prospects and crippling money shortcomings. That is, until a kidnapper accidentally contacts them instead of his intended target. And they decide to insert themselves as the middle-man into this situation.<br/><br/>It's a workable plot. I've heard much worse. Unfortunately, I simply loathe the execution. The two vagabonds, played by Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty, are insufferable. You want nothing more than to slap them on their heads and tell them to shape up and take responsibility once in their lives. Their landlord, played by Paresh Rawal, is the only sympathetic character in the movie, and even he plays it way over the top in a way that I haven't seen in a Western movie since the middle of the last century. The constant singing and dancing doesn't help.<br/><br/>Cultural differences, I know, but it's still a rather tall order for me to ask one of my friends to sit through a comedy way over two hours long if I didn't laugh even once during its run-time.<br/><br/>Apparently this is a beloved comedy classic in India. And if they find the film hilarious, power to them. Personally, I regret the hours I had to spend watching this. A movie is funny, when you can laugh at Om Puri. In fact he brings more laughs than the main characters. I could easily compare him to Robert De Nero, who excelled in "Analyze Me" and he never envisioned himself as a funny actor. The script is superb and the laughter is infectious with the venerable master of comedy, Paresh Rawal, at the helm. Akshay Kumar, who is other wise pathetic in serious roles, makes a good team with the muscle man Shetty, whose acting skills, are in the same range as Kumar's! After "Padosan" there has been some sprinkling of comedy, more like buffoonery, with the likes of Aaamir Khan, Johnny Lever and Shakti Kapoor, whose comedy interludes appeal to the "sophisticated front bencher's" who like fart jokes and toilet humor and Anti-Indian and demeaning humor produced by the "Benchods of Bollywood" as in films like "Three Idiots", "Delhi Belly" etc. The front benchers like filth since they live in the slums and this is the best they have seen in their life. They worship these "Monkey's of Mumbai" the Midget, The Ugly and The Apeman, since they are promoted by the "Media Maggots of Mumbai" who give glorious reviews for the price of banana thrown at them time to time. The comedy was generally demeaning, cheap and vulgar. But the audience had to put up with this, since there was no alternative, and they were not to blame since the scribes were not funny in the first place. The scene is changing with the script-writers and director the caliber of Priyadarshan. This is one funny movie that has opened the flood-gate for movies like "Mallammal Weekly" and others. I love love love this movie and have watched it several times, and each time I laugh out loudly. Its one of those classic comedies that you can watch over and over and appreciate even more for the lack of truly funny movies in this genre. The comedy is completely slapstick, but Paresh Rawal, Akshay Kumar, and Sunil Shetty make it work so well. This is where Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar's comedy partnership commenced, and they have worked in more successful comedies.<br/><br/>The story is about three men who have an opportunity to con someone, and everything ends well. I highly recommend it, but be prepared for slapstick comedy. Om Puri is also added to the mix and is funny as well. Om and Paresh make a good pair too. His Excellency Mr. Paresh Rawal did Excellent. Excellent.<br/><br/>Excellent.<br/><br/>His Excellency Mr. Akshay Kumar did Excellent.<br/><br/>His Excellency Mr. Sunil Shetty did Excellent.<br/><br/>There is something about these three....<br/><br/>These three can get together and make very good comedy movie of any form.<br/><br/>Thanks and Regards. this movie is awesome wicked and so funny. i love this movie man it awesome. the funniest actors are akshay Kumar and parish rawal. suniel she tty isn't that great.<br/><br/>its about these three poor guys who have no money but when a kidnapper calls a wrong number that is written in the phone book and says they have their granddaughter and must give them 10 million dollars so they contact the real man and ask them for 20 million cause so they can have ten by them selfs then the trouble starts not everything goes to plan.<br/><br/>guys if you haven't seen it better see it. so guys listen carefully get of your butt and go to your Indian movie store and buy it not rent cause you would want to see this over and over again . The performance by Paresh Rawal is a good enough reason to watch Hera Pheri. It is a standout performance by one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. The other members of the cast also do a commendable job. Hera Pheri involves a heist when three men decide to earn a quick buck without realizing the consequences that might follow. Even though the film has a few plot holes and inconsistencies, the witty dialogs and comic timing of the actors make up for the deficiencies and makes this movie a memorable watch. The movie could have been shortened by removing some unnecessary songs. However, this movie belongs to Paresh Rawal. I cannot stress on the brilliance of his acting. Go and see the movie now. Hera Pheri is a movie where each character, scene, costume, and joke firing on all cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings. Sunil Shetty, Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal are in their best ever roles and with every scene or say the punchlines, they prove their expertise in acting. Some parts of the movie are so funny it'll burst half the blood vessels in your face.Hera Pheri isn't just one of the funniest movies of the year 2000, it might be one of the funniest movies of all time. One can never get bored watching it every time!!!<br/><br/>I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com . It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended. There apparently is something I'm missing big time with this film. The effusive praise by many reviewers on this board calling it the best or funniest movie ever is completely lost on me. At present, I've seen an even dozen pictures from India, and they run the gamut from excellent (2015's "Drishyam") to dumb and dumber ("Andaz, Apna, Apna"). By further comparison, 2009's "3 Idiots" was immensely more satisfying to watch than the three idiots in this picture. To be quite honest, the principal reason I'm drawn to Hindi titles is their placement on IMDb's 'Top 250' film lists, with a personal goal of watching and reviewing all the ones I can. This one, I have to tell you, was a chore to get through. Since we're talking in three's here, this would have made more sense to be called 'The Three Stooges of India', in which case I would have been better prepared for the pratfalls and nonsense going on. By this time I'm well aware that Hindi films often easily exceed two hours, padded by a handful of musical song and dance numbers. That was the case here as well, but my oh my, the second one in this story had to go at least ten minutes. It was so long that one of the principal characters had four or five wardrobe changes! I haven't given up on Indian movies as a result of this picture, but I have to be honest, this one was hard to take. No word this film
Can't express . ...
Rating 10/10
#Mustwatch #Masterpice #classic
All actor play superb acting
Indian cinema one of the best film ever Raju and shyam throw babu bhaiya in river Chase by police and they were to sharp minded raju specially find the way to escape from any condition. You can watch this movie with the iconic characters any time any where. It won't ever let you get bored. Best movie to go for laugh therapy. A must watch for simple and clean comedy. Best comedy movie..watched many times ..never gettin bored of itt Sublime comedy of Paresh Rawal. And evergreen everlasting never to grow old movie Don't rate this movie if you don't know Hindi well, you won't just get it. Imagine Morgan Freeman getting some subpar dubbing in The Shawshank, how will it sound? It's the same thing here, if not more. Paresh Rawal (Baburao) gave his best and one of the best and famous performances in the history of Bollywood here. But you won't get any of it if you don't know hindi well. I just read some of the English dubbed lines those sound stupid! They can't judge Baburao.<br/><br/>So my request, if you don't know Hindi well, please don't rate it. This movie wasn't meant for you. An epic movie which everyone should watch atleast once in their life. Baburao is a character which is unique in the whole bollywood. Enjoy this movie whenever you have time. Hera Pheri is a classic bollywood comedy film, directed by Priyadarshan starring the comic trio Paresh Rawal as Babu Rao, Akshay Kumar as Raju and Sunil Shetty as Shyam. This film, with its impeccable comic sense, far from vulgar or obscenity, presents, more than comic reliefs, the contemporary Mumbai city-life from the perspective of middle class unemployeds if not poverty-ridden subalterns. Raju, Shyam both sunk in the ocean of debts, comes to Mumbai, with dream in their eyes, only to earn bread and butter, in the giant professional bourgeois culture of the Indian financial capital.
The way the character of Raju and Shyam are portrayed, is equivalent to Freudian id and superego respectively. While Raju vows to 'cheat anyone to fill his desperate need of money', Shyam examines any work from it's socio-ethical construction. Babu Rao, on the other hand, having discussion with both the impulsive, freudian idiotic Raju and ethical pessimist Shyam, concludes and finally 'decides' whether and how to go ahead, resulting a balance between id and superego, reflecting human qualities. With the satisfaction of their desperate need of the hour - money, the film resolves to provide a poetic justice in the end, which seems utopian, miraculous to some extent. Having said that, only because the conflict resolutes to conclude with the poetic justice, it soothes the emotions of audience. Although flop in the opening days of the film, the film managed to get a whooping 8.2/10 on IMDb and successfully secured a place in the shelf of bollywood classics, as well as the fans and spectators of the industry. This movie is one of the best comedy movie ever. Whenever i watch this movie i laugh a lot. Fabulous acting by everyone. This has brilliant comedy and brilliant plot. This movie is not a one time watch you can watch it a lot of times and i promise that this movie will make you laugh a lot. <br/><br/>Plot- Three men who live in same house make a plan to earn money by cheating Devi Prasad.<br/><br/>Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar did a very very very good job and Paresh Rawal character is unforgettable. The songs are good especially 'Dene wala jab bhi deta, deta chhappad phad ke'. This is a movie that you must watch before you die. I give this movie 10 out of 10. Shyam a.k.a. Ghanshyam (Sunil Shetty) has come to Mumbai from Gurgaon seeking a job in his late father's bank. Apparently his father died in a fire that broke out in the bank and he claims that the bank owes him the job. He badly needs the money for his friend Khadak Singh's (Om Puri) sister's marriage. A young woman, Anuradha Panniker (Tabu), is also in the running for the job, her father having died two minutes after Shyam's. Shyam meets Raju and a misunderstanding causes Shyam to think that Raju is a pickpocket. A fight ensues between the two, and Raju escapes, leaving his wallet with Shyam. After Raju leaves, Shyam discovers that he had his own wallet on him all the time. Unfortunately, this realisation comes just as Raju returns with two policemen, insisting that Shyam has robbed him.<br/><br/>Later that evening, Shyam reaches Star Garage. Baburao agrees to take him in as a paying boarder, although he warns Shyam that he will have to share the place with another boarder and will have to help with the household chores. Unfortunately for Shyam, the other boarder is Raju, who has not paid Baburao a single penny of rent in the last two years. The two men come to blows again the minute they see each other. Raju vociferously objects to Shyam's presence and threatens to move out. Baburao is nonplussed by Raju's indignation and calls his bluff. Eventually, Raju backs down, claiming that he's only staying because he owes Baburao and he hates to leave debts. The two men are constantly at each other's throats, and poor Baburao often ends up suffering the physical consequences of their conflict.<br/><br/>Raju manages to trick Shyam into signing a document that says he will give the bank position to Anuradha. When Shyam discovers the fraud, he threatens to sue both the bank and Anuradha. Panicked, the bank manager tries to get Anuradha to seduce Shyam, but he's having none of it. Eventually, she makes a deal to give him the position in exchange for money. Shyam is unable to get the money, and when he goes to bluff his way through the deal, he discovers that Anuradha is living with her mentally ill mother in abject poverty. She admits that she discovered that Shyam's own financial situation was as bad as her own, and that she didn't have the heart to go through with her plan, so she gives him her resignation letter. Shyam refuses, insisting that he could never live with himself if he accepted, and that she should keep the position. The two of them become friends and even begin a romance.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Khadak Singh shows up at the bank looking for Shyam, whom he believes to have stiffed him. The bank manager gives him Baburao's address. Raju is only too glad to put in a "good word" for Shyam with Khadak Singh, and it is only thanks to Baburao's intervention that Shyam escapes being throttled by Khadak Sing. Shyam, however gets even with Raju by shaking him down for gas money in front of his mother, threatening to reveal to her that he isn't really earning good money as he claims to be.<br/><br/>Baburao is constantly getting called by people who want to speak to a Mr. Deviprasad (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), which annoys him no end. One day, however, things become serious when a kidnapper named Kabeera (Gulshan Grover) asks for Deviprasad. Only, this time, he's asking for a ransom to be paid for Deviprasad's granddaughter Rinku (Ann Alexia Anra of Avvai Shanmughi fame). The trio figures out that the phone numbers for Star Garage and Star Fisheries, of which Deviprasad is the owner, have been mistakenly transposed in the telephone directory.<br/><br/>Now, Raju decides to benefit from this situation and has Shyam call Deviprasad posing as Kabira and demanding double the amount asked by Kabeera so that they can pocket the other half themselves while satisfying the ransom demand. However, when the rich man's employee realizes that Deviprasad's granddaughter might have been kidnapped, he involves the police. Angry that the police showed up at the exchange spot, Deviprasad threatens to shoot Inspector Prakash (Mukesh Khanna) with his own revolver, thereby allowing Raju, Shyam and Baburao to escape in the confusion. Kabeera's plans are thwarted, and as punishment for involving the police, he calls the trio again and doubles the ransom.<br/><br/>Following their brush with Kabeera and the police, Shyam and Baburao inform Raju that they're out of it, but Raju eventually shames them back into helping him. They tell Deviprasad to meet them at the rendezvous point an hour before Kabeera's appointed time. When they meet with Deviprasad, he demands to see his granddaughter. Eventually, the trio are forced to admit that they are not actually the kidnappers, just three guys in over their heads, but that they will get his<br/><br/>actually Deviprasad's granddaughter pretending to be her kidnapper and saying, "Kabira speaking". The film ends with the trio breaking into uncontrollable laughter This movie is very hilarious and entertaining! It has great dialogue, great comic sequences, great entertainment and action, and great performances, most notably Paresh Rawal. He has immortalized the character of Baburao as one of the most remembered Bollywood characters of all-time. He is excellent and hilarious, and his timing is great. Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty do great as well, and they also did great comedy. Tabu was sort of wasted in her short role however. The script is great and iconic; so many of the dialogues like "Kaun Devi Prasad?" have become famous and remembered. Honestly, the only thing that threw me off was the music; it wasn't too good; only "Jab Bhi Koi Haseena" stood out. The direction was also pretty good; this film is what gave Priyadarshan a big name. But besides that, if your'e looking for a great time, this film gives you that for sure. The movie is perhaps the best comic flick I have ever watched. It has all the elements and ingredients of a super comedy. From tickling dialogues to impeccable acting from everyone and especially Paresh Rawal, makes this movie a treat to watch. I have watched it numerous times and never get bored of it. Although I am not that kind of a movie maniac but this movie is a real laughter dose. <br/><br/>The greatest factor behind the exceptional success of the movie is that there are no attempts of making the audience laugh by overacting by characters or by idiotic script but the situations and circumstances in the script force you to enjoy every bit of the movie.<br/><br/>I give this a ten plus rating for all the good reasons and not because of favoritism bias. A must see for every comedy lover. I agree with couple of reviewers below about IMDb ratings being way off. This movie is over-rated by any which measure at 8/10, I was very generous to give it a 4, probably because of the cast. It is without a doubt the weakest comedy by Priyadarshan. I have seen desi movies grossly overrated or underrated on IMDb and have basically given up relying on IMDb for Bollywood movie reviews all together. If this is the kind of comedy people enjoy and support and reflect the type of movies that are to come out of Bollywood then that explains why we still have the same true and tried formulas coming out over and over 90% of the time. There are better desi movies coming out these days than 10 years ago but this is not one of them. One of the best comedy movie I have ever seen specially the acting of Paresh Rawal is exceptionally good and Akshay Kumar is the best actor suited for every role.A first class story, fine acting and well crafted dialogues make a rare combined appearance in this Bollywood comedy movie for all time.Every time I see this I used to go into laughter.Sunil Shetty, Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal together are are atom bomb I will rate beyond 10 if I can. I have started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com, it not only suggest great movies to watch,it also tells where you can watch the movie online ... Highly recommended I saw this recently and was wondering after an hour when it's going to get as funny as everyone says it is...sure there were a couple chuckles here and there, and the plot actually starts right at about the intermission, but the acting was overall ridiculous and the humor was idiotic rather than entertaining. I couldn't help but compare this to another Hindi movie that actually is funny and had me rolling with laughter---Masti! So,if you want a really funny, entertaining Hindi movie with a good plot as well, I recommend Masti rather than this dud of a movie. My rating: 3/10 (there were only a few chuckles here and there) It's already a 2000 movie, and it still uses the old comedy method. There is nothing new about singing and dancing. Basically, it is imagination.<br/><br/>The entire setting is not very reasonable, just for the happy ending. Although the movie is lively and determined, but there is no comedy atmosphere, it is more like a farce. It's a great comedy and you will enjoy it a lot but only if you are an Indian.
If you are a foreigner who is just watching this movie for a cinematic experience or because of it's high rating, then I really suggest you should not watch it. Most of you who have seen believe that it's because of Indian culture is why you didn't liked it but the reason which made this movie amazing was because of it's humourous dialogues and the manner and the language in which they were spoken,but if you are watching this movie with the help of subtitles you will never in a million years experience the feeling that this movie wants to display. Simplicity, no vulgarity & excellent actors make it a perfect comedy movie. The real representation of common man & their Desires but also shows the real meaning of friendship. Priyadarshan is a the only prominent director from Kerala, in Bollywood!! As he did so many colourful movies in Malayalam, he remade so many Malayalam films in Hindi, and also in Tamil.... He usually remake the films which are got so many surprises and having no supernatural characters.... and of course which are box office hits...!!!! He remakes films of himself, which are also written by him in most turns, and of other film makers... Siddhik and Lal are a famous film making pair in Malayalam film industry. This film is a pure remake of the Malayalam Mega Hit "Ramji Rao Speaking". In the original film there is a theater manager and director Mannar Mathai(Innocent) who runs the "Urvashi Theaters"!!! Gopalakrishnan(Mukesh) is a tenant of Mathai, since the theater is not going appropriately. Balakrishnan(Sai Kumar) came to the city to claim for a job in the company where his late father worked. A girl, Rani(Rekha) also claims for this job, whose late father was also a worker of that company. The manager of the company(Shankaradi) tries to make Balakrishanan to fall in love with the Rani to solve the dispute b/w them. Gopalakrishnan and Balakrishnan were always in making trying to make problems to each other. Gopalakrishnan was mocking in front of his mother(Sukumari)as a millionaire. All the three had so many problems, the only solution is MONEY!!!! Once a phone-call came to Urvashi Theaters from a kidnapper who introduces himself in the phone as "Ramji Rao Speaking!"..... The kidnapper Ramji Rao(Vijayarakhavan)misunderstands the phone number of Urumees Thmapan(Devan) with that of Urvashi Theaters, from the telephone directory.... Exactly Rao kidnapped the only daughter of Thampan, Nisha. Balakrishnan and companions plays a game in b/w Thampan and Rao.... And that makes more interesting incidences... And construct a good comedy at last !!!!!<br/><br/>In the original film Mamukoya plays the role of Hamsakoya, a friend of Balakrishnan.Harishree Ashokan, Alappey Ashraf, Kunchan and NF Varghese also did some small but remarkable roles. <br/><br/>Priyadarshan could do the Siddique-Lal Magic's repetition in the Bollywood, up to a limit !!!This movie is a good remake of the original.... I don't know where to begin. This film is awful. There is no excuse for producing such an atrocious film. Some films are so bad, they are good. This is not one of them. <br/><br/>The acting is below the standard I would expect of a 2nd grade play. The directing is worse than I would expect from a smart phone. The editing may have been put together by throwing the film reels in a blender.<br/><br/>The comedy is so poorly executed, with second long delays in actors reactions in slapstick, I am shocked that the hundreds of people who worked on this film were happy to have their name connected with this film. Did nobody provide oversight? <br/><br/>My dislike of this film is not because I do not speak Hindi. I have enjoyed many Indian films. This is not one of them. Most of my friends watched this movie just to understand memes. This movie had one of the best casting and it is in top 250 movies of IMDB now, i am happy about it. I watched this when i was a kid on TV and downloaded this and its sequel to watch it again and again. A must watch movie There are times when the simplest stories touch your heart, or your funny bone in this case. Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri was amongst the smallest films of the year 2000. It did not have much going for it. The starcast was not huge and Priyadarshan was not as big as he is today. That's when the script comes into play – and that is where Hera Pheri scored and it didn't really need to score anywhere else.<br/><br/>Hera Pheri tells the story of 3 common men with a common goal – to survive in this big bad world. All is fun and games until one night, they get a phone call..<br/><br/>As mentioned above, what makes this film so great is the simplicity. Also, the film does not have the best pot in the world but because we fall in love with the characters and their situations – we don't even notice the blemish. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the chemistry between the trio of Akshay, Sunil and Paresh. These guys are the life of the film. You don't get bored of the movie either because there's usually something happening. Scenes to look out for:<br/><br/><ul><li>Akshay and Sunil's first meeting - Whenever Om Puri enters to look for Sunil - Tabu's entry when the trio are having a mildly violent but playful fight. - The crazy and hilarious climax. My favorite scene is when first phone call comes and Paresh picks up – Rib tickling!!!</li></ul><br/><br/>Flaws? Of course. The songs are a major drawback and come as speed bumps in the narrative. What is worse is that the songs are not even worth listening to. That is the major flaw I saw in the movie. <br/><br/>The writing is just splendid and the major credit should go to the dialogue writer Neeraj Vora who has written some remarkable lines. The music is below average. I did love the locales and sets because they were simple but had an amazing feel to it when one sees the film. <br/><br/>Priyadarshan has not been known for being technically brilliant but he gets the job done as a director. Even here, he's very good. Not the best but still, his direction is great. <br/><br/>Hera Pheri was a turning point for Paresh Rawal. The man who used to play the baddie in the 90's changed his path after Hera Pheri. To say that Paresh is brilliant, to say that Paresh is hilarious, to even say that he's out of this world – all would be understatements to this man's work in this movie. It's best to just keep quiet and smile when asked about this act.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar is efficient and does his job well. Sunil also is in good form. Om Puri is a delight and Tabu does good. <br/><br/>Overall – A colorful, entertaining and amusing delight is what I would call Hera Pheri. Watch it once, then again and again and again.<br/><br/>4.5/5 Now, I've seen plenty of stupid movies but what makes this stand out is the fact that I was on board for the first hour of it. By no means was it anything spectacular up til then but it was alright, especially for a Bollywood movie. But after one hour the movie went full mentally challenged person. They introduced a whole new plot line that had absolutely nothing to do with the first half and by the end it had completely spiraled out of control. All of a sudden this comedy drama of four broke people struggling for money turned into a hostage situation with terrorists, cops and sword-wielding uncles. Oh, and our main characters turned into some weird musketeer trio. This movie was stupid because it threw away everything it had set up in the beginning for some deluded, over complicated story. Which, by the way, only got worse the more you watched it. Highly disappointing since it showed such promise, to not be another over the top, stupid Bollywood movie. 1 out of 10 stars. I was amazed at how a film can be so heart wrenching and rib tickling at the same time. I felt really sorry for Ghanshyam and Raju in the beginning, and just when I thought the film is going into a melancholic tone, it surprised me with its fun elements.<br/><br/>The story is hatke, and very interesting. There is no attempt to make it too filmy, except for the unnecessary songs in between. But all is forgiven when a film is made so brilliantly. It's a situational comedy, an intelligent one with very few clichés.<br/><br/>I loved the characters and performances. Paresh Rawal is the best here, with his unmatchable comic timing. He has really got into the skin of an old Maharashtrian man. Akshay is hilarious, and though he has played just too many roles of this kind, this was probably the first. Sunil Shetty is much more decent than he is in other roles. The supporting cast Om Puri (a bag of laughs), Tabu, Mukesh Khanna and all the others are fantastic. I also liked the goodness of the characters and the fact that they did this all out of their helplessness, though being selfish at times. Very real, very human.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is the most laughter-provoking and ends the film aptly. This one should be on the list of things you must do before you die, watch Hera Pheri! There are a lot of things that I admire about this movie be it the simplicity of the plot, characters we can relate to, its seriousness despite being a comedy, the no nonsensical humour and pretty much everything.<br/><br/>The problem with other comedies is that they try to put a joke in every scene. But here, things are different The plot is rather simple, no confusions, characters are believable ,the problems faced by them are kinda believable. I can feel a connection with all the characters. It's a realistic comedy.<br/><br/>This film truly defines the comedy genre. Today's comedies are all about making weird faces.<br/><br/>This movie is great in every criteria whether it's the acting or the character development or the tight scripting. However, there are just too many songs at unnecessary times and that are just too long(the only reason I am not giving it a 10/10).<br/><br/>At one point, this movie was in the IMDB top 250, now it's removed due. Don't know why? Not sure if it can represent India at big stage but for Indian viewers, this was a welcome change then. This movie is full of Comedy.Viewers feel amaze after seeing this movie.This Movie plot is based on 3 characters who want to change their life.And one day they find a way for changing their life. Or I can say that solutions of all problems they are facing. And during the journey of that way they go through different different Emotions that shows them true meaning of life.All Actors of the movie has done a very good job with their characters.This movie's scene are so funny that keep their audience entertain and take whole attention of their till the end. During the free time or someone feel bored or feel tired they can watch this movie and feel amaze. A clip of this movie can also put some fun in your life. I don't watch Hindi movies that much. But hera pheri is something different. This is the best mainstream comedy and probably the best mainstream commercial movie except the songs. I see a lot of world movies and I don't find many Indian mainstream movies that can be compared to world standard. Hera pheri is exception. This is best comedy can get. Awesome story, perfect acting and moreover the comedy is based on situation as well as dialogue based. Priyadarshan tried to come up with the same quality with some other comedies later but never came up with anything near to hera pheri. Only problem with the movie is the songs which doesn't fit at all with the story. Still its one of the best comedies i have ever seen, undoubtedly the best Indian comedy. when i first saw the rating here 8.6 with over 100 votes i thought: wow, i must watch this movie. but only then i read the storyline. sorry guys, but this movie is an almost remake (as far as the storyline goes) of a big malayalam hit of the 80s, "ramji rao speaking" (ramji rao is the villain here), directed by the director duo siddique lal. priyadarshan was such a great director in malayalam. he started with slapstick-movies, then very good comedy movies (chithram, kilukkam) and then even really good serious movies (almost all with actor mohanlal). but then, one day he decided to remake malayalam hits (and not even his own ones, but that too) in Hindi. "Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar" for example is a remake of the malayalam movie "sanmanasullavarku samadhanam". even the story of his latest malayalam movie "vettom" is bit copied from the English movie "french kiss" with meg ryan and kevin kline. 'Hera Pheri' is my favourite Priyadarshan film and in my opinion, his last good film. He has somewhat specialized himself in comedy since but nothing (perhaps with the exception of 'Hungama' and 'Yeh Tera Ghar Yeh Mera Ghar') comes even remotely close as they are pretty much equivalent to garbage. Coming back to the film at hand 'Hera Pheri' is an almost classic and has good repeat value.<br/><br/>The jokes work well because they are about everyday issues and are cleverly written. The characters are relatable as ordinary people trying to meet their daily ends. This is also why the first half of the story works beautifully but it is the second half that goes slightly haywire as it treads the formulaic part (the kidnapping plot which has been used in numerous other comedies such as 'Andaz Apna Apna' and 'Waqt Hamara Hai'). That is not to say that it was devoid of entertainment. Quite the contrary as entertainment is plentiful in 'Hera Pheri'.<br/><br/>The cast deserves full marks. It is their playing off each other that worked brilliantly. This was during the time when Paresh Rawal was hilarious and his comedic flair was refreshing and amusing (unlike the staleness and repetition that he approaches in current movies). This was also among the few films when Sunil Shetty actually did act. Tabu is excellent in both the comedic and intense scenes. She's a delight to watch as is Asrani who is awesome. But, 'Hera Pheri' is Akshay Kumar's film. The actor displays his flair for comedy to the fullest and it makes one wish had only more directors cast him in such good comedies that would let him shine as an actor. For Kumar, this was the year when his acting (not stardom) peaked as 'Hera Pheri' was preceded by 'Sangharsh', where he breathed fire into his role, and followed by 'Dhadkan', where he does a splendid job.<br/><br/>The songs aren't much of note. The first song is downright boring. I liked the song visualized on Tabu, Sunil Shetty and Asrani. It's one of the funniest songs. The item number does not contribute to the film but Namrata Shirodkar sizzles. The rest of the songs fit well with the story even though some of them are too long.<br/><br/>'Hera Pheri' has been recognized as one of the best comedies of recent time. Although I don't want to use the word best here, it is a highly enjoyable film that I have already watched a couple of times. Hera Pheri was 2000's best film for me and it released at a time when Akshay Kumar had only 2 hits back to back from 1999 after a string of 18 flops. This was his comeback blockbuster film and a good comedy film too. Priyadarshan is know to be the father of comedy and this time he really proves himself worthy. Hera Pheri is one of his best films and it is much better than its sequel Phir Hera Pheri which was a bad follow up. The film also made Paresh Rawal famous after doing several villainy acts, one of his first comic acts was praised. Sunil Shetty too deserves an applause for his decent performance, this got him career the boost he needed after his most recent Kala Samrajya got delayed and bombed at the box office. The film is so good it keeps your attention, even the melodramatic scenes are realistic and well formed, the film is flawless and never makes you cringe. It is one of the best Bollywood comedies with no silly comic scenes and actually funny elements which is why it works. The action sequences are hilarious and though the ending is a bit silly, it is so funny that it is forgiven. Compared to what crap Priyan makes nowadays, this film is one of his best. In fact, if Priyan directed the sequel to this, he would have done a good job. On the whole, this film will be remembered for its good comic scenes, brilliant performances, awesome songs, and neat dialogs. Overall, a job very well done. I just saw the movie for the twelfth time, and my ribs are still cracking from laughter.<br/><br/>Hera Pheri is an amazing movie. Typical Priyadarshan movie - a scan mishandled by a bunch of novices leading to a comedy of errors, the movie has excellent comic timing and witty one-liners. Without giving away the plot, I can mention few instances, for instance when Sunil Shetty gives the kidnapping threat - "I'll cut your dog to pieces and feed it to your granddaughter" (It's the other way round - granddaughter was to be killed in the threat"<br/><br/>Jokes apart, the movie has an excellent depiction of the problems faced by the urban poor - those who flock to the cities in search of opportunities, the bonds of friendships among the people in small communities, bureaucratic mess and a load of others, lending a humane side to the comedy The performances are good, particularly Paresh Rawal, the crude garage owner with a heart of gold. Music, thankfully, takes a backdrop in the movie, and the romantic portions (a bane on Bollywood movies) are limited to a few. <br/><br/>Rating: ******** and a big thumbs up to Priyadarshan. All in all, a great family movie (the few crude alcoholic jokes not- withstanding), one that you would doubtlessly enjoy many times over. Until "Hera Pheri" came along pitifully the Bollywood audience were confined with outings served by Govinda & David Dhawan in the name of comedy while the South was zooming ahead in leaps and bounds. "Hera Pheri" came by and changed all the rules to the extent Govinda was ousted from Bollywood and David Dhawan was going nook and corners seeking a job. <br/><br/>The were two things that came to light with "Hera Pheri" was tongue-in- cheek writing and brilliant timing of all the actors. After a long time in Bollywood (after Anupam Kher) a character actor stole the thunder right under the noses of lead actor. Yes, it was Paresh Rawal who was a revelation and perhaps redefined his persona in Bollywood.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar - A turning point for Akshay to the point of rise in his career that he challenged the reigning heavy-weights for the top spot.<br/><br/>Sunil Shetty - Perhaps the only actor who did not get due credit from the success of "Hera Pheri".<br/><br/>Tabu - Sadly she did not even make an attempt to pursue her interest and encash on the success of "Hera Pheri". Probably just served her purpose of getting a pay-check for her efforts.<br/><br/>Om Puri - As usual reliable and spot on. Comic timing was impeccable.<br/><br/>The true-to-life characters and easy to relate circumstances laughed its way into the audience hearts. <br/><br/>Priyadarshan, no looking back since "Hera Pheri". Way to go! I don't really have anything positive to say about this film. Not satisfying in any way. The occasional chuckle and not having Aamir Khan are the only reasons I didn't give it a 1 out of 10. This is a remake of the tamil flick Arangetra Velai starring Prabhu, Revathi. The Drama company is changed to a garage in the Hindi movie.<br/><br/>5/10 because this is a remake of a Tamil flick. This movie is a remake of original Malayalam movie "Ramji Rao Speaking" (1989). The original version was better. Best comedy movie ever made, Hera Pheri. The historic trio Raju-Babubhaiya-Sam made it unforgettable. Priyadarshan's best work as a director. Very awesome comic timing . a amazing movie by all actor Raju (Akshay Kumar) is a tenant of Baburao Ganpatrao Apte a.k.a. Babu Bhaiyya (Paresh Rawal) and has not paid his rent for a long time. Raju does not believe in hard work and wants to earn easy money. He cons everybody, even his mother (Sulabha Arya), who thinks that her son works in Calcutta. Baburao, a bespectacled long-sighted man, runs the "Star Garage". He has a familial debt with many money-lenders and has hard time with them.<br/><br/>Shyam a.k.a. Ghanshyam (Sunil Shetty) has come to Mumbai from Gurgaon seeking a job in his late father's bank. Apparently his father died in a fire that broke out in the bank and he claims that the bank owes him the job. He badly needs the money for his friend Khadak Singh's (Om Puri) sister's marriage. A young woman, Anuradha Panniker (Tabu), is also in the running for the job, her father having died two minutes after Shyam's. Shyam meets Raju and a misunderstanding causes Shyam to think that Raju is a pickpocket. A fight ensues between the two, and Raju escapes, leaving his wallet with Shyam. After Raju leaves, Shyam discovers that he had his own wallet on him all the time. Unfortunately, this realisation comes just as Raju returns with two policemen, insisting that Shyam has robbed him.<br/><br/>Later that evening, Shyam reaches Star Garage. Baburao agrees to take him in as a paying boarder, although he warns Shyam that he will have to share the place with another boarder and will have to help with the household chores. Unfortunately for Shyam, the other boarder is Raju, who has not paid Baburao a single penny of rent in the last two years. The two men come to blows again the minute they see each other. Raju vociferously objects to Shyam's presence and threatens to move out. Baburao is nonplussed by Raju's indignation and calls his bluff. Eventually, Raju backs down, claiming that he's only staying because he owes Baburao and he hates to leave debts. The two men are constantly at each other's throats, and poor Baburao often ends up suffering the physical consequences of their conflict. When HERA PHERI released it didn't get many takers and the film managed only an average run that too mainly in Mumbai For reasons many, it was promoted as an action hero and also had action stars Akshay and Sunil, critics also panned it but the film got cult status. The film like most Priyan films is a remake of a Malyalam film RAMJI RAO SPEAKING but it's handling is great, Before this film Priyan made social dramas and action films but from here he made mostly comedies. The first half is a bit slow though the scenes between Akshay,Sunil and Paresh are funny, the problems all 3 face in their life is believable, it's the interval point the real story starts and the gags that follow keep you entertained till the end, the end is hilarious<br/><br/>Direction by Priyadarshan is good Music is okay, the songs are quite good<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar was not a great actor then but is good as Raju though at times his dialogue delivery isn't up to the mark Sunil Shetty too falls in same bracket but he had delivered in some films like Hu Tu Tu and here he does a great job especially in the kidnapping episode, though at times his emotional scenes don't create the desired impact, also his dialogue delivery isn't up to the mark Paresh Rawal is simply outstanding, he stole the show, he makes you forget you're watching Paresh Rawal that impactful he is Tabu is decent in a short role, Mukesh Khanna is as usual, Khulbushan Kharbanda is okay, Gulshan Grover is as usual, Mushtaq Khan is okay Om Puri is hilarious as Khadak Singh rest are okay
