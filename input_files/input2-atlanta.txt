There is a lot about this program that I shouldn't relate to. I don't live in America, I'm not black, I'm gaining a few years on the cast. But through impeccable writing, casting and acting Atlanta draws me in to a world that finds a strange yet utterly compelling way to tell a story. The comedy and tragedy mix as happens in real life. The often brutal reality of being young and black and poor in America fuses seamlessly with more existential themes of growth (personal and professional), family, race, power dynamics, legacy and much more. This work is beautiful in both a comedic and dramatic sense. The dialogue, the script, the chemistry of the characters. Amazing. The dynamic of the characters is broad. I feel invested. I actually feel like it's true life. I'm from Baltimore and it reminds me of conversations with friends when I was younger. Darius is seriously my favorite character... everything about the guy. I'm still laughing about the gun shop scene. (dont think that's considered a spoiler)<br/><br/>That was my review but they are making me fill more space. Just know that this is my FIRST review.. I think they deserve it.<br/><br/>Not many words here but I rave about this show to everyone.<br/><br/>Here's my 10th line. This show is extremely funny but not for everyone. It doesn't just tackle hip hop culture it also makes fun of many modern day sociopolitical issues. I would recommend for people who are open minded. As a long time fan of Glover from Community, his stand up comedy, and even to his rapping (Childish Gambino), I was of course excited to see this show.<br/><br/>As a pale white guy from Ohio, I still found the show to be very enjoyable and with the way they did the first episode, it has a monumental chance to be successful. Darius cracks me up with how he thinks, he's exactly the type of quirky person you need in this type of show (assuming I know how it's going to continue), but he is basically the Daryl of Walking Dead. Everyone will love him and if he ever dies the show may go downhill without him.<br/><br/>Since I've been a fan of Donald since Community I may be a tiny bit biased, but he yet again seems to be a superb actor and I already felt connected to him and wanting him to 'win'.<br/><br/>It's no surprise Donald will turn this into an amazing series because he is a great actor and writer.<br/><br/>Just please don't kill Darius. How will we ever have rat phones if he dies? I have seen the first two episodes, when are the next ones coming?<br/><br/>I watched each episode almost a week apart. Each time I hated it. Each time the show ended it was only like 5 minutes. They show one or two scenes and the show is over. They better have 50 episodes per season to make up for this feeling.<br/><br/>Each time I checked & the runtime was just over 21 minutes so my computer is in on it too. I don't know how the director and producers of this show got my computer in on it but I know their plot. <br/><br/>There is no way a show goes by this fast and is 21 minutes long!<br/><br/>Oh and the "main" character, Glover something, what is the deal with him? Is he a comedian or something. What is he trying to prove. I find myself laughing at the strangest and most uncomfortable situations while thinking of the scene and story at the same time. Why is he making me feel and think about the horrible situation while at the same time being entertaining and funny. Atlanta, created and written by the multi-talented Donald Glover presents an intriguing, dynamic chemistry between an enigmatic Earn Marks (Donald Glover) and the stern, hostile, hood-driven city of Atlanta. A college drop out, Earn Marks seems to be living life at the bottom of a pit; a broke father, estranged by his parents and engaged with an absurd relationship with a girlfriend who mothers his daughter (unclear) - everything seems bleak. However, when news breaks out that his cousin Alfred 'Paper Boi' Miles (Brian Tyree Henry) is now the new hot rapper on the block, Earn drops everything he is doing to pursue the job of being Paper Boi's manager. <br/><br/>Even after having watched 3 episodes of the TV show, I still find it tough to pinpoint exactly what genre this absurdly riveting series falls under. While it pushes towards the drama section, the show is ridden with comedic bits. From the cinematography, to the acting, to the script, so far I have nothing but praise for Atlanta. Moreover, I cannot understate the rounded quality of the characters, to which I cannot end this short review of Atlanta without mentioning Darius (Keith Stanfield). <br/><br/>The eccentric nature of Darius is precisely exemplified by the first meeting between Earn and Darius in Episode One (The Big Bang): Darius holding a plate of cookies, wearing a cooking robe and a bandanna, with a knife ready to attack in case of an intruder. Even though he is consistently under the influence of cannabis, from time to time, Darius exudes of intellectual and spiritual wisdom. As in Episode Two (Streets on Lock) when speaking about the violent altercation of the previous night, Darius explains "As humans we are always close to destruction, life is (selfish) but a series of close calls I mean how would you know if you were alive, unless you are willing to die."<br/><br/>The TV Show Atlanta is an avant-garde in the African-American film industry and seems to be following the same footsteps of top quality shows like Power and How to Get Away With Murder. Donald Glover has created a grabbing story which only begs for more. Looks like FX has once again found another island in the rough with their new show "Atlanta". Creator, Writer and Actor Donald Glover (no relation to actor Danny Glover) is that guy who everything seems to happen to him and/or around him. Featuring a primarily cast of color, Brian Tyree Henry, Keith Stansfield and Zadie Beetz (each established actors) will surely become household names with this series. Like some of my other favorite FX shows (The Americans, AHS, FARGO, You're the Worst), "Atlanta" is gritty, in-your-face and realistically captures a slice of life rarely shown on TV. "Atlanta" is an adult show about climbing the ranks into the rap scene, and surviving the neighborhood, that shouldn't be missed. It's been a long time since a show has been able to suck me in with the pilot. The last show that was able to do that was Monk. Usually when I see a pilot I'm thinking, "That was okay I guess. But I don't care what happens with them to keep watching." It was very different with Atlanta. I wanted to see what happened with Earn and Paperboy. I want to keep seeing every week what happens with them. <br/><br/>It also feels very real. Although there's a lot of humor involved and some things are exaggerated, I feel as if this material was created by someone who experienced these situations first hand. When it comes to showing the Black community on Television it usually feels fake and based on stereotypes. This doesn't feel like that at all. That's what I love the most. <br/><br/>If you're not watching this you should be. It's funny, the acting is realistic and believable, the writing is great. It's hands down one of the best shows on television. A huge TV buff, I made an account just to start reviewing after I watched this show. It is all around perfect. It's a dry humor, with very witty writing- but has me laughing all the way through. It's a bit awkward when things get serious, but the serious parts are strongly acted and are very deep and moving. <br/><br/>I go from laughing hysterically one minute to teary eyed the next. <br/><br/>Atlanta is all around one of the best shows I've ever watched. Donald Glover strongly grasps the raw emotion of mental illness, family relationships, and what it's like living in Atlanta.<br/><br/>This show can relate to all people, and is presented to show others the perspective of a young black man trying to make it in Atlantas rap scene. Atlanta is an incredible must see show! Donald Glover is an amazing talent who seems to do no wrong and who leads an amazing cast! I really can't say enough about this phenomenal show except to go watch it! Season 1: 8/10
Season 2: 9/10
Overall: 9/10<br/><br/>Can't wait for more. So good. So creative with so much talent.
So good. So creative with so much talent. I was thoroughly impressed with this series. The humor is often understated but is there and good. LaKeith Stanfield's Darius provides a relaxed, affable Yin to Earn's and Paper Boi's yang. Zazie Beetz is also great as Van, whose subplot provides drama every bit as good as the humor. The Teddy Perkins episode was as surreal as any TV episode I had ever seen. The flashback episode regarding the FUBU shirt was sweet and tragic simultaneously. The faux commercials on the interview episode were also hilarious. Katt Williams' performance was also exemplary; and I didn't expect this. I am anxiously awaiting season three. Kudos to Mr. Glover and his writers and staff! Well done! I decided to watch because of Lakeith Stanfield but I fell in love with all three characters, Darius especially.<br/><br/>Earn is so cute and timid and funny in his own way trying to find his meaning. Darius, I don't even know where to start from, it's like he lives in his own world or something. Paperboi tries to make money through every way he can.<br/><br/>Atlanta makes me laugh myself to tears. Even when I try to sleep or in the bathroom, I remember a scene and start laughing.<br/><br/>I'm just done with season 1 but I think I'd follow this till Season 10 if it continues like that.<br/><br/>It's a 10/10 for me As a fan of the rap/Hip hop culture, I've already been introduced to Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino. Just seeing him in the preview for this show got me excited. The show is centered around a young man named Alfred 'paper boy' miles and his cousin Earn Marks. Alfred is an up and coming rapper from Atlanta that just released his first mix-tape and his cousin,earn, see's he has potential. Being in the financial crisis he is, and having his knowledge, Earn sees an opportunity to make himself some money as 'paper boy's' manager, all the while trying to get his cousin to the big leagues. As a show created by a rapper, about the rap scene, i don't see anywhere the show could go wrong. Everything about this show is great. The acting, the storyline, and the music. The music in this show really brings a perfect vibe to this show. Such an amazing show, with such relatable qualities Absolutely very funny. Plus the writing is just on another level On paper I really wasn't sure this was something that I would like, but it is truly amazing. It has such an understated quality to it. At times it is so tense and dark but still manages to be so funny.<br/><br/>I love how Donald Glover's mind works.<br/><br/>There is nothing I don't love about this show. We just need more of it. A phenominal TV show backed up by its phenominal cast and well written script. The second season of this series is more hard-hitting than the first with its better plots and ultimately better production. This whole show is amazing, great performances, surrealist a times, hilarious in some episodes (watch B.A.N. episode, I was tearing of laughter) and extremely entertaining.
I'm down to everything Glover does because he is such a terrific guy. What an incredible show <a href="/title/tt4288182/">Atlanta (2016)</a> is. Taking place in Atlanta and centering on the trials and tribulations of trying to make it in the rap scene, we learn of the myriad of social, racial and economic issues that arise in everyday situations. Glover, Henry, Stanfield and Beatz are all are lights out, creating characters that we truly feel we know by the end of two seasons. Beyond the magnificient writing, acting and direction, there is an unparalleled uniqueness with so many episodes - whether it be offering moments of laugh-out-loud comedy or legitimate suspense/horror - that makes this show one of the most inventive things out there, almost like it operates in a completely different world at times. I've loved every second of all the risks its taken in its creative freedom and can't wait to see what else these guys have in store. Two huge 👍up! I really hate hype and I really hate big claims. This show, when it aired the fall of 2016, was pretty much hyped to death and regarded itself as "Twin Peaks for rappers". So like any sensible person, I waited until things cooled off before I decided to dive into it. The distance really helped me watch the show for what it, at least from the first season, is - a very offbeat show that deals less with plot and more with the mundanities of life than I would have expected from it, nor would I have ever wanted.<br/><br/>The flurry of 10 star ratings is no doubt coming from Donald Glover super-fans, and I really don't think this show would be successful if he had nothing to do with it. When watching it I had to ask myself that question, "Would I even be sitting through this is if it weren't for Glover?" The answer, was leaning on the "No" side, and I know I am not alone.<br/><br/>The show has is a simple enough premise but really leaves a lot to be desired regarding plot and character development. The tagline states it's a show about "Two cousins, with different views on art versus commerce, on their way up through the Atlanta rap scene." Nothing of the sort ever occurs. They don't talk about art vs. commerce at all. It boils down to Donald Glover's character playing the manager of his "gangsta rap" cousin Alfred "Paper Boy" Miles, and on occasion Glover's "Earn" will tell Paper Boy they need to make more money. That's it.<br/><br/>I was really expecting some kind of struggle between the two artistically, I was expecting some kind of discussion over what type of sound is appropriate, what type of promotion is lucrative, and whether or not taking such routes were worth the trouble -- regular musical-biopic-style concerns. But Glover, for better or worse, just cannot ever play it mainstream so he chooses to chase around vague ideas of poorly written parenthood (For two parents of a toddler, Earn and Vanessa seem to be incredibly available to live their lives without their child), ham-fisted "deep" ideas about violence (the scene at the shooting range where one of the protagonists decides to shoot at a target of a dog as some kind of social commentary on shooting targets that look like people.... I have to ask, have any of the writers ever even been to a shooting range? People don't just take their ear-protection off and start arguments, nor would a range owner ever take a shotgun and point it at an alleged troublemaker to scare them out of the store. The audience deserves better writing than this), and surreal just to be surreal moments (A mysterious man giving contrived, overly cryptic pseudo-philosophical advice to Glover, a showy rapper who literally drives an invisible car, black Justin Bieber, etc)<br/><br/>What you get out of this amalgamation of attempts at a David Lynch-esque TV series is a show that doesn't exactly know what to make of itself and doesn't seem too concerned with any fluid style or plot. A very strange attempt at a TV series, but not necessarily a miss either.<br/><br/>For instance, one episode will be about Vanessa losing her job as a school teacher because she smoked weed the night before with an almost overbearingly shallow Instagram whore (yeah, incredibly deep characterizations at play again), only to have the next episode be a series of fake commercials and segments for a parody of the BET network (which, as you'll see from the ratings, is easily the most favourable in the first season). The chaotic shift in tone happens all throughout the show and leaves the viewer with a disorienting lack of reference. With a show that has this much disregard for structure, you wonder if Donald Glover & co should have just made a sketch series where they can try out many different ideas at a faster pace than a drawn out dramedy that really at the end of the day goes from "Earn is Paper Boy's manager" to "Paper Boy might have a gig somewhere outside Atlanta" with absolutely nothing in-between. <br/><br/>It almost makes the show frustrating to watch. While I don't fault "Atlanta" for taking risks and trying to be experimental, it absolutely does not live up to "Joel and Ethan Coen make a show about hip-hop".<br/><br/>When "Atlanta" works, it's very much a quirky piece of unexpected mundanity and when it doesn't, it just comes across as half-baked and needlessly vague. It's the kind of show that probably wouldn't have this high a rating, never would be given a second season, and wouldn't ever have been given a chance to begin with if it weren't for Donald Glover's existing success and very big claims from the beginning. Users who rate shows based on seeing only one episode really do other potential viewers a disservice. Rate it episode per episode, then rate the show once the season is done. It's that kind of patience that helps kill the misleading energy of hype.<br/><br/>However, it's also the kind of show that will definitely get better in the following seasons as it develops more of a distinct personality and flavor for the viewer to appreciate. Unfortunately that's not going to happen until 2018 so here's for hoping it comes back and actually starts to live up to its promises and claims by auteur Donald Glover. As much as I thought it could use improvement after the first season, I certainly would love to see it succeed in the years following. Funny and intelligent. Highly recommend to watch stoned Love this show. This is a really great show . They have great actor and actress on the show. I just wanted to say the first line that wrote but they said it was too short It's the best half hour comedy/drama to come out in a long time. Great acting, directing and even better writing. Donald Glover is a force to be wreckened with. Interesting TV Show I would recommend giving it a try It's impossible to place Atlanta in a particular box. What it essentially offers is a brutal, blunt (pun-intended, of course) slice of life every episode. And that's the genius of the show. It does so much without compromising on character development. If it has to comment on society, it'll do that and then also make that a comment about its characters.<br/><br/>It's difficult to find an episode you can't watch again, or an episode that hits. Be it the ridiculously hilarious B.A.N, or the soul-crushing Helen, or the soul-searching Juneteenth, or the absolutely horrifying Teddy Perkins. And if you're a hip-hop fan like me, there are some moments you won't stop laughing at (Norf Norf mom y'all, and "THIS IS DEFINITELY GOING ON WORLDSTAR"). If you're not a hip-hop fan, doesn't matter, you'll find those moments funny, too. The show has some extremely smart jokes nonetheless, and above all, poignant observations about race and gender that will stay with you no matter what part of the world you're from.<br/><br/>What kind of reviewer am I if I'm not talking about the performances? Incredible cast. Donald Glover has proved himself to be everything at this point. He's creatively unstoppable. Lakeith Stanfield as Darius is sheer brilliance, flipping the cliche stoner dude trope in great ways ("Why would I shoot a human?"). Brian Tyree Henry is a star, flipping the cliche rapper image to reveal layers of needs, wants, and insecurities that Alfred/Paper Boi has. Zazie Beetz is, just, well, insane, and a strong character like Van suits her really well.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: oof. Where do I begin? AutoTune croons (Skrt by Kodak Black still hits), soul music at all the right times, cold, hard trap at the more violent moments (I mean, they play Tay-K), psychedelic music, pop music, the soundtrack of this show is complete and the best right now. Just is. No question.<br/><br/>Atlanta is easily the most unique show this decade, and definitely one of the best shows this century so far. The awards don't reflect an inch of the true brilliance of this show. It's just beyond surreal. I will happily wait for Donald Glover to cook up season 3 if he needs time to make a masterpiece like the first two seasons were. I found the first four episodes of the series to be interesting and rich in originality. However after the fourth episode the quality seemed to take a sudden downward plunge.<br/><br/>The main character Earn and his cousin Paperboy are both easily irritable and put in too much effort to separate from the flock, however they both end up in a typical edgy hipster stereotype. They are on their own very dull characters, but in the first four episodes they are encountered with peculiar characters and events, while the last six episodes of the first season can be described as normal people experiencing normal things. A TV show can consist of 5 individuals sat in a room & as long as it's well written it can work. Atlanta isn't set in a room, but it does work because it is well written. The battle has already been won.<br/><br/>The writing doesn't alienate or ask too much of the viewer, rather it effortlessly lulls you along. There is an intentional dream-like quality to the writing that elevates it from the world in which it is set, ergo adds a magic unseen which sets us up to believe.<br/><br/>I realise I'm making a ballyhoo about the writing, but it really is that good. They've managed to hit the sweet-spot. Good writing is hard to come by these days & its lack of presence is often masked with visual or audio trickery. Well done to those involved.<br/><br/>The acting is good, the characters have an authenticity that is relatable & I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series. The satire is admirable. A little of Donald glover can steal a narrative, a lot of Donald glover can push it overboard. As and Atlanta native I fell in love with the show's ability to depict Atlanta's youth and hip-hop culture with slang words like "Fye" "Fire" and "Lit" as well as the show's ability to comment on social issues in the city with a unique sense of humor. Very entertaining and original. I love how it stays with the same storyline but can veer off and still keep your attention. It's definitely in tune with today's youth and current events, while keeping old heads like myself in touch. Great show! Love it. They really capture the feeling of living in Atlanta. It's a unique place and they really capture it. The show is so unpredictable, which is something comedy shows have a hard time pulling off. Can't wait for 3rd season. It's shockingly real, hilariously sad, terrifyingly and I can't get enough. Paper Boi, Darius, Van and Earn are so real it hurts. Season 2 has truly tested every boundary. Genius In every scene. I watch and rewatch, just gets better Created by and starring Donald Glover (who also directed 2 episodes) I wasn't quite as blown away as most of the critics were. (I think I was over-hyped by the time I watched) but I certainly liked it. For me, the 1st season was pretty uneven from episode to episode, but the stronger episodes are terrific. <br/><br/>It's got more of an old style sitcom approach in terms of structure (not at all tone!); the focus week to week isn't on a big serialized overall story. Each episode has it's own self contained tale within the larger basic set up. Personally, I generally like longer story arcs better even in dramady (e.g. Transparent, etc), but the show is so fresh, odd and creative in other ways that it helps balance out that drawback. <br/><br/>Often very funny and sometimes much larger than life, it also has moments of real emotion and subtlety. The acting is strong all around, and it's a world we haven't seen much before â€“ struggling working class African-Americans friends in their mid/late 20s who are not the tough street kids and dealers from the hood we've seen so many times, but who certainly aren't safe and middle-class either. There are guns and drugs but also jobs and kids and record deals. There's real violence but a lot more threatened violence and posturing. And all the characters and relationships are complicated and multi-leveled. <br/><br/>Glover in particular creates a wonderful protagonist in Earnest. Super smart, open hearted, extremely witty, dead-pan, ambitious but also vulnerable, emotionally confused and a little lost. He's hard not to love and to occasionally be frustrated by (in a good way). <br/><br/>When the story of the week gives the show enough meat to build 30 minutes on, it can be great. When the story is thin, more of a one line joke, the episode tends to feel thin too, sometimes starting to feel padded and/or straining for humor. <br/><br/>But it's an impressive start, when it works it successfully combines social satire and comedy with real feelings and surreal story touches, and feels like one of those shows that has room to grow and deepen in future seasons. Aka Childish Gambino, now that's he is all political and shi* just can't even watch the show. Like the show thinks it's so creative and smarter than the viewer when really it's kind of boring and trivial not to mention stereotypical. This is a very well written, well-acted show, and Donald Glover is absolutely phenomenal as its lead. It's a show with many great moments.<br/><br/>It's not, however, a series I plan to keep watching. In part, it's because there's too much quality television nowadays, making me insanely choosy. In part, it's because as I age I become increasingly mindless and more and more spend my times watching action shows like The Strain over intelligent dramas like Rectify. In part, it's because it falls somewhere in between shows which reflect my experience and shows that are so far outside my experience that I find them intriguingly alien, so that it's neither familiar nor unfamiliar enough to hit that sweet spot.<br/><br/>If I watched more, I could probably really get into this, but as I say, there's a lot of competition for my limited viewing time. But I'd say everyone should take a look at this one. What is the message of this show? The main character is a total loser. He's not a loser in the way that he can't help it, he's just a loser because he refuses to accept reality. It's also ridiculous to see his parents not helping him out, something that tends to happen a lot in America that bothers me. There are some other things that I would like to say, but won't because it isn't politically correct, but the whole show makes certain people look really bad, and it's not the right image people across the world should be seeing.<br/><br/>The show is alright to watch, but I don't know if I would watch another season, to be honest. Not so much a laugh out loud show, more of an intelligent social commentary made with a lot of humour. Having said that though, I accidentally ingested something green and edible and the B.A.N episode (aka Donaghue) was one of the funniest things that I have ever seen it my life. I'm still not sure what happened.<br/><br/>100% recommended. Brilliant TV. It is unfunny, unoriginal and celebrates the BLM and entitlement, victim mentality of most of Atlanta's populous ... skip this hard I think my review covers whatever this show is trying to be.<br/><br/>Can't think of a more tired attempt at a new Seinfeld "nothing" style of show than this one. The most unusual and best series ever. The narrative is disjointed but still makes it captivating. And a certain kind of maturity is present throughout the show. Enjoyed Season 1 of 'Atlanta' but didn't start really getting into it until 2. I'm middle-aged and white, so don't pretend to identify with the lives of these guys, but can see the comic (not to mention social) potential in a series like this and thought a lot of things were well-observed. If at any point 'Atlanta' did annoy me I'm pretty sure it was the writers' intention (eg Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino's character 'Earn' is clearly meant to be complicated and frustrating). Season 2 goes all over the place, literally, with some very dark and funny moments! The art of this kind of TV series is when you keep coming back to moments in your mind afterwards. Smoking weed under the confederate flag on the university campus, Darius (Lakeith Stanfield)'s visit to the rich crazy recluse to collect the piano, that weird episode when Earn and Van (Zazie Beetz) visit a German festival ... probably all topped off by the episode where 'Paper Boi' (Bryan Tyree Henry) gets dragged around by the crazy barber. Henry's bemused expressions are priceless, don't remember the last time I laughed so much (think that was the intention? :)) A beautifully realised look at the absurdity of life . Smart , funny and genuine . I am really enjoying it . Not much to say. If u have half a brain u know it's art. Peace and love. Paaaaaperboi. Donald Glover a national treasure. Thank me later. Wow, just wow. This was one of the most amazing TV shows i've ever seen. Just the way it's written and the acting is absolutely top class. The show gives you this amazing vibe you just wish you could hold on to. And when your finished the whole season if leaves you wondering what you'll do now with your life . The characters were very well developed, and the idea was amazing. <br/><br/>There are 10 episodes in the season, which are all around 25 minutes, so it's very short but each episode tells a very unique story. The first episode blew my mind away, it was like a scrambled riddle that you've been spending years trying to figure out only to realize that the answer has been right in front of you the whole time. <br/><br/>One of the main reasons I love this show is because of the characters, each one brings something to the screen, without them it would be like missing a piece of your life. Together they construct this group that no other show has ever shown me. <br/><br/>I'd love to thank the writer of Atlanta, cause you really just blew my mind away. You guys created your own world in your own way, but I got to admit after watching episode 7; B.A.N, I was really confused, I thought maybe I was high, but I realized that it was the creativity of Donald Glover/Childish Gambino (my favorite rapper of this century). I mean that guy is so freaking talented.<br/><br/>This isn't a show about getting to the top of the rap game, even though that's what the trailer led me to believe. It's a very creative smart funny humorous series that your wishing it was your first time watching it again.<br/><br/>Also I'm the 7000 person to rate this on IMDb :) Donald Glovers metaphors are so on the nose it hurts. Two examples straight away from the show. 1. When the mom is shouting at her kid for copying paper boy but as soon as she sees paper boy she gets all hyped and asks for a picture completely forgetting everything she said to her kid moments earlier. Ooh we get it, society worships celebrities at the expense of morals. 2. When Glovers character is the only one concerned about the mentally ill guy in the jail who everyone else laughs at then gets beaten up by the sheriff. 'Look at me caring for the mentally ill people thrown in jail!!' You can say your message about social issues without being so hamfisted about it. As for the rest of the show there's nothing particularly interesting or noteworthy about it. It's not very funny and it doesn't talk about life in Atlanta in an interesting way. This show is quite simply fantastic and unapologetically relevant 'Atlanta' showcases the brilliance of Glover and his creative team whom deserve every accolade they get as they delve into the lives of not only industry workers and creatives but of minirities in the contemporary setting of modern America. Feeling accessible at every stage and with plenty to offer the relaxed, laidback tone of the show is amazing I highly recommend THIS IS AMERICA .......Love this show grateful im caught up missed the penultimate episode of season and the marathons will never been unappreciated. It's just a show that s actually shows people speaking in real dialogue & is touching even warm in its sensitivity to the characters in the most womderful surprises. It funny its timely these are ambitiously fun mostly good young Americans trying to go mobile in the upward direction. I wonder why we havent seen these kind of men women and kids in a realistic portrayal on tv before. THANKS FX...i love all the characters Donald is so handsome cute and Val the most beautiful actress ive seen on tv. Until Ms.Angela Bassett is back for more AHS!! This is such good timing for me.I once cancelled my cable for 5 years. And was thinking if theres no more Thrones or any really great shows i wont pay 120$ for tv! But im betting on FX even better than HBO WESTWORLD included! I love to be transported by art. Good tv now is what storybased films were when studios didnt bank on 5 superhero 3D flicks to make up the big money. Its got to be why we get the director of Shawshank to start the Walking deads first season.they wont be inedible for long now, based on rumours, but i am gonna wanna watch paperboi learn those hard lessons with Earn and Darius& Val et al.....really great show to look for song selections...and to the folks who MAKE Atlanta..youre on the right network! I look forward to more cool shows...marathons are grest for temporary depression and look the tunnel is back fkr season 3!!!!!! YYEEAAHHH.<br/><br/>.... Waited this long to watch this show. needs more audience. people will love this show. Donald Glover and his team are brilliant individuals. I had been curious about this show after seeing the previews and reading the reviews I was 4excited however I cant help but feel like I was let down I guess I expected too much I loved Donald glover on community so naturally I thought a show he created would be decent but from what I saw I just didn't get it and I really don't get all the praise if I am missing something I am sorry but I don't see the need to try this ever again so sad cause as I said I love Donald glover and it breaks my heart to give a show of his a bad review but I just couldn't take it This series manages to be entertaining and meaningful. One of it's strongest qualities is how it riffs on life's absurdities. The casting is spot-on. Several episodes this season were quite poignant -- the scenarios reflected empathetic themes, and many viewers will be able to connect. Kept seeing previews of this show while I watched something mindless like Real Housewives or similar. Finally put it on and didn't realize it was a whole season in. Currently binge watching and am almost through the first one....<br/><br/>This show is amazing. I saw it listed as comedy, which it's not in the conventional sense. More of a spot on social commentary. Like a wink and nod to real situations. Most shows have a learning curve where the actors take a few episodes of getting into character. Pilots are normally awful. Not the case with this one. Everyone is so natural where you believe it from the get go. It just keeps getting better with each episode. <br/><br/>The rating on the tv says MA on every episodes, but I have yet to see anything super offensive compared to half the stuff on tv. Atlanta is an American comedy-drama television series created by, directed by, executive music producer, written by, produced by, and starring Donald Glover (The Lazarus Effect, The Martian). The series is about two cousins navigating their way in the Atlanta rap music scene in an effort to improve their lives and the lives of their families. <br/><br/>I know this show has been over for a while now, and most people who wanted to see it already did. However, I finally finished all the episodes and I was surprised by the first season. I know there is a majority of people who love this show. It is either one of those shows you want to check out or you simply don't. At first, I didn't really care to view this series. But, once people started talking about how good it is, I decided to take a look. On the other hand, I did enjoy it, but I did not enjoy it as other individuals. <br/><br/>Currently, Atlanta has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, so obviously many people are really digging this series. For starters, I think the show is funny. It has that dry kind of humor that not too many people like. For me the humor worked most of the time. Especially the "Justin Bieber" and Montague episodes!<br/><br/>The few episodes of the series feel like a lot of character development, and a slow tide slowly building up. They open on Earn Marks (Donald Glover), lost in his own life and struggling to find some sense of forward direction. With a need to tend to the beautiful, brittle yet sympathetic Vanessa (Zazie Beetz), the mother of his child and to his own deep sense of career dissatisfaction, Earn makes the spontaneous decision to head back to his home turf and play manager to troublesome cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry), who's on the cusp of making it as rapper Paper Boi. Along with Alfred's strange friend Darius (Keith Stanfield). The cast was absolutely a knockout! All the characters get an equal amount of screen time, the feel like real people, and are very well rounded with depth, back-story, and values. My favorite part of the series is definitely the cast. At times characters are really fun, other times weird, and at times serious. The show is a comedy-drama, and believe me there is some serious drama. These characters come across drugs, violence, poverty, racism, sexism, and domestic strife. What's doubly interesting about its strikingly large scope, however, is that Atlanta doesn't feel like an "issue" show. Rather, it naturally folds all of these topics with a comedy twist.<br/><br/>The story is a story we have seen many times, the story from rags to riches. Glover does great in the role, however, Glover doesn't hold a candle to his two co-stars Henry and Stanfield's singular performances stand as arguably the best part of Atlanta. With their fun energy, mumbling, slang, stoned comedic delivery, organic chemistry, and pitch- perfect timing on delivering dialogue. <br/><br/>So these are my final B*tchin' Buddha thoughts on season one of Atlanta. It has a really good cast, excellence performances, the writing is great, and all the characters feel real. Sometimes the comedy works, sometimes it doesn't. It is a very easy, laid back, comedy drama, and I wouldn't mind seeing season 2. I believe the first season of Atlanta earns aÂ…<br/><br/>7 out of 10!<br/><br/>Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. And remember don't just get down, but get Boogie :) After just finishing the first season, that I almost binge watched since the episodes are so short, I can see the potential of this series to go for many more seasons. It's not hilarious but there are some subtle humorous passages that makes you want to watch more. Brian Tyree Henry as Paper Boi is to me the funniest character of this show, and I think the whole series should be more centered about his character. The rest of the cast is also good, and all contribute in a different way to the story. A story about people trying to make it in the rap scene and in their daily lifes. I'm going to start the second season and I expect to still be entertained by this easy to watch show. Perfect to finish an evening before going to sleep. There is not enough ethnic diversity in this TV show. Too much blackness. Diversity is the new trend, live up to it people. I really enjoyed the show and the message it was trying to get through to the viewers I absolutely love this show. It is definitely one of the most profound, thought-provoking television series of modern time. The way that Donald Glover creates social commentary through humorous situations is reminiscent of The Boondocks' style of comedy. While I personally find this series to be phenomenal, it is an acquired taste. If you enjoy social commentary and keep an open mind, then Atlanta will definitely be the show for you.<br/><br/>The story of Atlanta is that it is a surreal television show focused around sociopolitical issues and the lives of Earn, Alfred, Darius and Vanessa as Alfred and Earn struggle to become successful in the Atlanta rap scene. Each episode is connected through the plot line of Paperboi's rap career and how it affects the other character, but they all focus on different elements of the society that the characters inhabit.<br/><br/>The messages that this show portrays through conflict are astounding. There are multiple conflicts that occur between characters throughout the show, and the majority of these conflicts are indicative of how violence affects the Black community. Earn is depicted to have an internal struggle as he strives to provide for his family and rectify his shortcomings. This often results in Earn having to make difficult decisions such as living inside of a storage facility and pawning his iPhone for a meager price. There are also a variety of societal conflicts depicted in this series. Everything from transphobia to racism to classism is touched upon in this show.<br/><br/>In general, Atlanta serves as a commentary on the Black experience in modern America. Each episode deals with these characters coping in a society that places them at a disadvantage, yet expects success from them regardless of their status. The script keeps you guessing not just between episodes, but inside of each show. One minute you are laughing, the next trying to figure out where the characters are going next. Definetly sit down with a mind ready to be expanded. <br/><br/>While I don't relate to the culture depicted, Donald Glover does an amazing job at placing you inside each characters mind.<br/><br/>Don't know if it makes we want to travel to Atlanta (there is a Georgia tourism apple at the end of some shows I noticed), but wouldn't mind getting some of the food shipped. <br/><br/>Theodore Perkins and the cut out of Drake marked my favorite guest stars. <br/><br/>Paper Boi and Darrius are great complements to Earn. The dynamic feels real and just hoping they all aren't too famous and busy to give us a Season 3. Atlanta, seven episodes deep and it goes nowhere. It's like a random series of skits...but poorly written ones.<br/><br/>Very meh. If you already know who Donald Glover is than you already know this show is going to be funny, nuanced, intelligent and captivating. You also know he isn't Danny Glover's g0dd@mn son. This is a man who is, in real life, a writer, actor, singer, DJ, and creator and has combined all his best attributes, amalgamating them into the series "Atlanta." You may know the singer Childish Gambino", or heard him on the radio and didn't even know it, or just have seen Donald Glover on a number of shows, but to really understand him watch one of his stand-up specials on Netflix and I doubt he is not entertaining/hysterical/thought provoking to many people. He comes across with a realness and genuine quality that is hard to find in comedy and when you see his repertoire of talents it hard to see them, stand back and just wonder how many things will this man produce in my lifetime (I'm 34). This show is off to a great start and I will absolutely watch anything starring this gentleman. Do your thang (sic) Paper Boi (sic?), because you got the right stuff, wet. Overview<br/><br/>It's the birth of a new series and strangely, it's a dramedy. Which is a good thing for it makes it feel like Atlanta is bridging the gap between the comedy star Donald Glover is expected to bring and the rare, non-soap opera styled depiction of not only Black people but issues which are part of the culture.<br/><br/>Trigger Warning(s): Gun Violence<br/><br/>Topic 1: Looking At The Border of Being a Deadbeat (Earnest }Donald Glover} and Van {Zazie Beetz})<br/><br/>With a job paying $5.15 plus commission, having a child, and living with his girlfriend who is dating other people, Earn's life isn't at its best. To put it frankly, he is struggling. What makes things worse though is he seemingly had this Princeton education he let go and now everyone treats him like a mooch. <br/><br/>{Commentary}<br/><br/>The mystery that needs to be solved is what happened at Princeton? It seems three years ago things were going right for Earn and then something happened. Something his parents don't know the details of, I doubt Van knows, and even the situation with her makes you raise an eyebrow. How in the world are you going to live with the father of your child, seemingly still mess around with him, but be upfront you are dating other people? Granted, if she didn't give him a home it would be likely he would be homeless since Earn's parents won't take him in, but damn! Her just letting it out that she was going to be out till 11 on a date was sort of harsh. Yet, it was also weird since they were making out, less than 15 minutes before she revealed the date, and she asked him to say he loved her. <br/><br/>Which, in retrospect, perhaps was the deciding factor in if she would still go on that date.<br/><br/>Topic 2: Paper Boi (Earn, Darius, and Alfred)<br/><br/>Earn's cousin Paper Boi, or Alfred, could potentially blow up. His mix-tape isn't universally respected but is seemingly doing well enough for Alfred to not be struggling like Earn. So, seeing an opportunity, Earn tries to be Alfred's manager. Problem is, while Earn went to college, Alfred wants a Malcolm X type as a manager. Earn's counter is Alfred is his own Malcolm X and he needs a Martin. After all, Alfred is the type to greet people at his door with a gun and his odd friend Darius will have a butcher knife to back him up. <br/><br/>Yet, despite being initial rejection, Earn presses on to get Alfred's single "Paper Boi" played on the radio and while an old friend, possibly from college, is of no help, a janitor named Prince (Alan T. Coleman) opens a door. However, being that Alfred is a Malcolm X type, it seems just as things were possibly going well he ruins it. All over a dude who kicks off Alfred's side mirror.<br/><br/>{Commentary}<br/><br/>Though not talked a lot about in the summary, honestly I think one of the most memorable characters of this show might be Darius. He, basically, is some sort of comic relief. For example, he is the type of weird dude who would ask Earn's father Raleigh (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) if he could measure a tree on his lawn and then pout and whine like a kid when told: "Not right now." Mind you, he isn't into trees or plants, but he is just this random cat who just says and does random stuff. Which sort of leads you to wonder how he and Alfred became friends, if not roommates? Now, it could be possible Glover and company may have introduced a gay thug rapper. Yet, there is also the possibility that while everyone abandoned Alfred after his mom died, like Earn did, Darius was still there. So, even if he may not offer much besides company and making cookies, at least Alfred knows he is there for him and not the potential of fame.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>To me, this show presents a different view of Black people. Yes, Alfred is thuggish and Darius seems like he belongs in a sequel to Half Baked, but alongside that you got Earn who seems like a normal dude. Granted, that Princeton dropout makes it seem like there are likely issues he is hiding, but how many Black male characters are there really like Earn? Much less who are the star and not some token best friend?<br/><br/>On top of that, I like the idea that the drama is Earn trying to figure out a way to take care of his daughter and not end up homeless, and the comedy is everything else. To me, there aren't enough dramedy type shows out there. Especially, not to beat a broken horse, predominately starring Black people. Often it is either Black comedies, with the occasional dramatic episode, like Black-Ish or else it is a straight rainbow coalition drama like what Shonda Rhimes puts out. <br/><br/>Which, I should note, there is nothing wrong with. The reason I can even note those shows and what they offer is because I avidly watch them. However, I also have watched shows like The Big C and many others which were rooted in the misery of surviving but finding little silver linings which get you through it. And that is why in the overview I say Glover is bridging a gap because it often feels like we can't get both a funny show which is also consistently serious about each character's issues. Yet, Glover changes that.<br/><br/>On The Fence<br/><br/>Without checking the previews, honestly, I think the only thing which could bug some people is that the rap music we hear from Alfred, it might not be considered that good. So considering Earn is trying to manage and promote him, you may have to get used to Alfred's rhymes. It's pretty good but it doesn't have whatever great shows have that keep you into it.<br/><br/>season 1: 6/10
pretty funny and clever but not a fan of when it tries to get serious and emotional, especially his baby mama (1 viewing)<br/><br/>season 2: 5/10
some episodes were weird and/or boring. not as consistently funny. i frequently put myself in the shoes of the characters when watching movies or shows, doing so in this show made me angry and aggravated at the dumbness he had to deal with. not necessary a bad thing for the show, but i didn't like it (1 viewing) Dear Atlanta writers.<br/><br/>If Paper Boy ever goes to Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia to be exact; or Austin, Texas maybe. Please, make sure you get a cameo from Nardwuar the Human Serviette, an interview should be hilarious. OK i really like this but am scared you guy are not digging deep enough, you guys content is nice , but all i see is usual like other movies , series , think out the box guys , you've got great content but you guys have room for improvement. since its a rap thing you guys are putting to us, go into what rappers do, their life style, study successful rappers from way back. let me give you guys a clue 1.i have watched 5 episodes with no rap battle yet, there's still room fir that am sure guys<br/><br/>2. rappers have friends constantly been killed nothing yet on that<br/><br/>i thing about 12 things that's have not seen yet that's constant with rap <br/><br/>you guys can improve am sure<br/><br/>Regards There a lot of paid reviewers for this show. The song she'll if your mindless and have no sense of humor. Save your time. I have to say that I found this show to be brilliant. Each episode was interesting and made me laugh a lot of times. The cast is amazing and made me love all the characters. The plot of the show was also really good. I had been looking for a show like this for a while now and I was really pleased when I discovered it. I was hooked and watched it in less than a week. It has fresh ideas and funny moments and characters. It's way different than all the other shows that are running. If you're looking for something that has comedy, sarcasm, drama but also somewhat criticizes some of our society's aspects, you'll love this show. I found it to be very original and I've recommended it to all of my friends. I'm really Looking forward to a second season. The background and the form merge and harmonize musically. The music Is important for narrative history and narrative. The music speaks, Music is a character, an omniscient narrator. Characters In need, the ambiance the vehicle. I devour this series in Sweetening the passing time on the pretext that it is only another Song, another track, another episode another half hour.<br/><br/>Funny, real, well-played and authentic this series is worth the detour! To listen! For example in the scene of episode 6 where the woman Of Earn (mother of her infant) is in the restaurant with her '' best '' Friends and their discussion inevitably leads to discomfort, music Which plays in background: (music) Are we really happy here with this Lonely game we play, looking for words to say ...<br/><br/>Brilliant!<br/><br/>Google translation might not be accurate, i was too lame and tired to traduce myself... Shame on IMDb Long Live FRENCH This is hands down the best TV show that I have seen in many years. So new, different, funny and you can relate to it. We at least need 5/6 seasons of this show! The cast is great. The style of humor is on point. The subject matter is new and different from any other TV show before. The combination of all of these things make this a great new show. I pray that the Directors allow this show to continue to be fresh and new and to not box the writers and actors into a box. The industry and TV viewers need more shows like this. The usual 'slapstick'style comedy has run its course. I am glad to see this show/cast get recognized for some awards. They are well deserved. *Very minor inconsequential spoilers<br/><br/>I am in stitches!!! Oh man! I just watched the 5th episode, "Nobody Beats the Biebs". I am in awe of the wit of this show - and the balls to showcase Justin this way. Actually, the best part of the episode was Darius' experience. How can we not love Darius? I sit eagerly waiting to see what crazy thing he will do or say next and he is so sincere about it all.<br/><br/>The social commentary this episode sure put me in my place. I felt very uncomfortable to see Darius hang up a picture of a dog for his target practice at the shooting range. It was no surprise to have others around him become angry and insist he take the picture of the dog down. Brilliantly, Darius points out that the others are using pictures of people for their target practice and wonders how this is more appropriate. My words can't convey how cleverly this scene was done through the writing, the acting, and the filming. Atlanta is full of this kind of deftly maneuvered commentary. I also appreciate that it unabashedly shows life in poorer black communities.<br/><br/>Another reviewer mentioned that this show gives us the full unleashing of Donald Glover and I wholeheartedly agree. He has a brilliant mind for understated humor. Everything is so seriously undertaken, but cleverly hilarious. Such a dope series...10/10 recommendation!!
The fact that its so neutral through out but entertaining is amazing, you don't really get that from any tv shows or movies, only time i think i watched something really neutral yet entertaining was that Adam Sandler movie "Men, Women and Children" Loved this series. So good, the only bad thing I can say about it is, I will have a hard time finding the next series to binge on that can even hold a candle to it.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into a bunch of analytical BS about the plot or the characters. I don't give a F about that S. If you are like me and look for a series that will actually mean something, then you're not going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Great work to all involved with the making of Atlanta. Such a strange season 2: the surprisingly thoughtful episode 4 (Helen), followed immediately by the mind-numbingly tedious episode 5 (Barbershop). And what on Earth was the point of episode 6 (Teddy Perkins)?<br/><br/>Since I don't find the supposedly funny bits remotely funny, this series would work much better for me if it concentrated on the social observation. I'd be happier if they got rid of Paper Boi ("I used to manage an artist called Paper Boi, but he got blown away"), with the focus instead being on Earn and Van's relationship. The series has great moments, the good script make the best critics using simple everyday moments.<br/><br/>But i really think Donald Glover has some problem with woman. Since his first works till now woman is mostly portrayed badly.<br/><br/>In Atlanta most woman are crazy, angry, super impulsive and too emotional(not much better from when he fetishized asian woman on his raps). So I like weird stuff, I like intelligent stuff, I like well done stuff. This show is those things. I am white, I mention this not because I think skin color matters but culture does. I am white alternative culture. I am tool on hard days, iron and wine on soft days. I don't follow drake, nikki Minaj or "black" hip hop urban culture. The color of the skin doesn't matter but we associate the culture with a color. So this is not my world. But that doesnt matter, good is good as I say. And this is good or at least the first season was. The characters are great, I love Darius, the first season was terrific. Season 2 seems way more self indulgent. Which is cool, if you like it. Honestly I am not sure I do. Every story is sort of early Seinfeld (stories about nothing) mixed with artistic high brow comedy. I am no stranger to this, but the first season seemed to be a story line following the career paths of a rapper and his manager. Now it is just these stories, each one unique and weird and almost seems to place the characters in hell or in some great Greek odyssey for 30 minutes. The characters don't grow or experience their lives as rappers or managers but for a moment and them bam, Darius is in a house with deranged white skin michael Jackson and his brother crippled vampire boy trying to escape for 30 minutes. Its intelligent, it allows me to enjoy hip hop black culture, but I preferred season 1. I like the concept of season 2 but, it broke with the original concept and its bizarre stories just seem off track now. It seems like a different show, and not in a good way though what I am watching ironically is in fact good, just out of place. I don't know how to explain it any better, other than to say it is worth watching if for no other reason than it is all those things I started this review by saying. I think it just does a 180 and loses the audience in the process. I am not sure if I had put in a review for the first season of the show which I why I feel necessary to start off with the fact it was absolutely brilliant and I considered a 9 out of 10 and re-binged just when season 2 started off.<br/><br/>I would like to keep my review of Atlanta S2 very much like the season itself: short and to the point. It is crisp with humor and subtle parodic representation of the world and somehow manages to squeeze great moments like 'Alligator Man', 'Money Bag Shawty', 'Barbershop' (It was ridiculous and almost made snap and laugh simulataneously), 'Teddy Perkins' and 'FUBU'( Special episdoe of sorts where the general storytelling is shifted differently; Like it was for 'B.A.N' back in season 1). And as the season ended with 'Crabs in A Barrel', we got throwback references and a look at how far The paerboi crew have come and reaffirm their loyalties (which means stuff gon be alright for S3, at least as much as it can be in the Glover Brother & co. direction of the narrative ;p).
I really liked Hiro Murai's direction in the season, all more buoyed by the 'This Is America' official vidoe by Don Glove (Sounds like One Piece manga character; I can only hope someone drops into Eiichiro Oda's ears) which so much fun and felt like it was cut out of some Atlanta dream clip scene for Earn himself. The main cast is very good, spotlight on Zazie Beetz for landing Domino in Deadpool 2 and nailing the humor in it and Brian Tyree Henry who is actually a soulful siinger who attended Yale Drama School and sang 'We Can Always Come Back To This' in the tear-jerking TV show This Is Us. Darius is Darius is Darius (I know the actor has a name, is a succesful rapper but Darius, ya know). I would like to end with kudos to the writers for portraying so many social commentaries in an enjoyable and tactful manner and I look forward to the next season from your pens to our screens. This review is based on the first nine episodes of Season 1. The first six really hit the ground running, I thought. Well-acted, packed with quirky but believble and engaging characters, and social commentary that was subtly entertwined within the character interaction. The scene in the prison waiting room in episode 2 (I think) was a master class in character portrayals as well as in the poignant ways that humans sometimes try to connect with one another.<br/><br/>But then the next three episodes came along and the spark seem to have gone out. Character development pretty much came to a screeching halt and social commentary that had been subtle and touching was now heavy-handed and preachy.<br/><br/>I may give Season 2 a try, but right now am afraid to be disappointed. Donald Glover has created one of the most interesting television shows this year, and this has been one spectacular year for television. Atlanta follows Earnest "Earn" Marks played by Glover as a college dropout who helps his cousin Alfred "Paper Boi" Miles (Brian Tyree Henry) to develop his rap career. The show doesn't follow any set plot with just the idea of promoting a rap career in the background as each episode follows different characters as they go through entertaining everyday trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>Earn also tries to make money for his child and her mother Van (Zazie Beetz). Van gets her own hilarious episode where she tries to fool a drug test with baby urine to hilarious results. Each episode walks the line between humor and seriousness without being too goofy or preachy. The show explores issues but adds in jokes that always keeps it lighthearted when it threatens to go down a depressing trail. This show is a critical darling and should be set up to win several awards.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com It took me awhile to get into this but I finally sat and watched one episode after another and really enjoyed it really enjoy season 2 Atlanta is one of the best shows on TV right now. Each episode is equal parts deep, funny, and random. B.A.N is easily the best half hour of television I've seen in recent years and overall the chemistry between the three male leads (Glover, Stanfield, Henry) is undeniable. A truly refreshing show from the mind of one of the most talented people in the world. Can't stop recommending this show. The first thing I have to say—and it's the most important thing anyone can say—is that this show is really, really funny. I've recently seen a few shows that are billed as comedies without the faintest shred of humor. Just watch the scene in E02 when Earn is in the lock-up and is involuntarily involved in an argument about transgender / homosexuality.<br/><br/>I'm not black and I haven't even lived in America in over a decade but I would imagine that this show says a lot about life for a lot of black males in the land of the free. It comes close to a documentary as far as verisimilitude.<br/><br/>One message I wish the show would put out there is that if you aren't ready for parenthood then don't have kids. In fact, don't have children unless that is what you want more than anything in the world. I think this is a good idea for anyone and especially America's poor be they white, black, or Hispanic. Imagine this couple if they didn't have a child that they can ill-afford. They would have a lot easier time making their dreams happen.<br/><br/>P.S. I really, really despise rap music.<br/><br/>P.P.S. Is there a worse American city than Atlanta? Jesus, what a hellhole of endless suburbia, traffic, income inequality, and more traffic. As a person quite distant from the African-American culture I'm hardly interested in series that have a "deals with the topic of race in America" bit in its description, but I thought that maybe I would like this particular series on account of it having been described as funny and clever, which are two things generally believed to be good. Honestly it has moments of the former but it pretty much never has moments of the latter: it is dumb as a rock, stereotypical and cliched as hell, and profusely douses everything in a dose of gross-out "humour".<br/><br/>It's not entirely unlikable: there is that "black conversational" charisma to a lot of the scenes, and moments of drama occasionally feel appropriate or interesting (albeit never profound).<br/><br/>A supercut I'd suggest would be to watch the first episode (probably the funniest in the season) to get acquainted with the story and the characters, and then the final 3 episodes of the season for a taste of the dramatic/observational aspect of it at its best. There's not much more to it than that, just a waste of time.<br/><br/>My ratings by season: S1: 3 Okay so we all waited over a year for this to come out....in the beginning filming with that type of camera/filter was cool, I get it you all wanted that gritty old school vibe. But after a few episodes it's just annoying! Lines going across the screen blurry as heck. I mean I know you wanted the 90's feel but you can barely see the freakin actors faces!!!! It's to much. Filming in HD wouldn't have taken anything away from the show. Just because it's ATL and black doesn't mean you have to make it look like it was recorded on a flip phone. iPhones have a crisper picture than this crap. I'm on episode 4 and feel asleep watching episodes 1-3. Yes guest appearances but about one fully line/moment through each episode. It simply does not measure up. This show is over hopefully it won't get reinstated for another season. You came you saw now it's time to leave. Nothing to miss anyways the film is so blurry and non-energetic that nothing will be missed. Same charters aren't funny anymore. We've already got use to you being the funny good kid and everyone else is the hood person who can't speak smokes weed and carries guns. Yes nice representation of ATL( sike) you've clearly been in Hollywood to long my dude. Atl is gentrified and no longer like that if you actually came here other than shooting the film in one of the last hoods left you would have seen that. Season 1 was hilarious and made me so excited for season 2. Unfortunately season 2 was depressing and not funny. Not sure why they changed the shows formula because the had gold. I absolutely can not stand the baby mama in that show. Her character made me want to turn it off. I just hoped it would be funny again and it wasnt. If season 3 is anything like season 2 I wont make it past episode 2. I'm only a couple episodes in but this is a pleasant surprise. I've hovered over the show a few times, considered watching it, but you never know with comedies. So far I would call it a bit of a dramedy as the comedy is pretty subtle so far. The acting is really good and I really like the storytelling and pacing. Excellent writing. Thus far I would say the show floats somewhere between and 8 and 9 for me. I really loved the scene with the main character in the jail processing area. You really felt for him. And seeing all the crazy characters around him and their banter. I also liked seeing the perspective of Paperboy and his early stages of finding attention from fans and the stress of being labeled an old school rapper. Just a very well done show. I love Donald Glover's Atlanta specifically because you never know what you are going to get. Every episode is funny, yet it touches on some deep subject matter that allows you to relate the story to your own life. This is by far my most favorite show on television. There is a hilarious moment in the 2nd episode, season 2 (I think) where Paper Boi calls for a Lyft car to take him home from his studio. He and the driver talk nicely and the driver expresses a strong liking for Paper's Boi's music. Suddenly the driver turns around and points a gun at his passenger demanding everything he has. But the driver is so sweet and apologetic and keeps explaining how he needs the money and is so sorry to do this. He goes on and on so nicely you really feel sorry for him. But that is the city of Atlanta. Courtesy is number one, combined with a sweetness that is irresistible. I've lived here all my life and while there is plenty of violence for sure, most people are darlings, even when they are ripping you off. It's a Comedy-Drama very unusual because, you think that it's going to show you the gueto with all the gangs issues and all the classic 50 cent though guys fighting each other and the protagonist trying to survive the poorness and other family-friends problems. 
 Well, it's like the upside-down of that haha, you can see a very irrevent parody of that reality with some little touches of drama behind. <br/><br/> It's an unusual comedy, and it worth it. I'm waiting for the Second season pretty excited.
