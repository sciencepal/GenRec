El Camino was to Jesse, what Felina was to Walt.<br/><br/>I was fine with how Breaking Bad ended, and was fine with how they left Jesse's character driving off into the night. But over the last few episodes of Breaking Bad, the show focused more on Walt and very little on his off sider.<br/><br/>El Camino was the farewell to Mr Pinkman that we didn't quite get from Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Before the movie came out I had asked the question " is this going to be a story worth telling?"<br/><br/>My answer? Yes, El Camino was a story worth being told. Everyone thought that El Camino would be better or equal to Breaking Bad; but the thing is you can't surpass perfection. Breaking Bad is undoubtedly the best or at least one of the best TV series of all time. Just because it isn't better than BrBa doesn't mean it sucks. This film is Jesse's Felina. Wonderful cinematography, great acting, great directing by Gilligan and fan favorite characters return. It however has slow pacing but all in all is a solid film. This movie is like 2 more episodes to BB. Won't disappoint you. Its not a thriller but a slow paced movie showing the fate of Pinkman.<br/><br/>Given total justice to BB series. It's sad to see the amount of people disappointed in this movie. I understand this is all subjective put personally I thought the movie was incredible. It was the perfect epilogue to the series and completed Jesse's story in such a satisfying way. It's the closure we as the audience could only desire, and more than a tribute to the series. So please, realize that this was never meant to be what Endgame was for the MCU, with crazy SFX and action non-stop, but rather Gilligan's masterpiece being fully finished.<br/><br/>Felina was the wrapping paper, this is the ribbon. A lot of the reviewers on here seem to be disappointed in what this movie was about, as if they expected Walt to rise from the grave and Jesse and zombie Walt go on a rampage killing anyone and everyone who ever wronged them. This movie was about Jesse and what happened to him directly after the events of Breaking Bad, as well as giving us some more insight into just how badly he was treated while being held captive by Uncle Jack and the neo-nazi gang. And it did exactly that in a way that was actually even better than I had anticipated. It was full of suspense and really kinda put Jesse in a similar situation as Walt, where he had to do whatever it took to get what he needed. I loved this movie and I'm so glad to have a proper send-off for a character that I loved. Did the story need to be told? Probably not. Todd was far too distracting for me to believe this was taking place during the same timeline as the show instead of years later because he did not age well. Aside from things like that I still enjoyed it, it was nice to see our old friends again. Thank you Vince for rising from your slumber to give us a second breaking bad finale that was still better than game of thrones. Seriously, do yourself a favor and ignore any 10/10 perfect scores. It's a fine conclusion to Jesse's story but not some masterpiece. This is a movie that we all honestly could've done without and have done without for what, the past 5 years? This movie has it's moments but it is never brilliant like the show. Even taken on its own, as a movie, it's nothing special. For a movie to be a 10 or even an 8 you should be special and this movie very much isn't. El Camino was not only an amazing sequel to the series finale of Breaking Bad, but an amazing movie itself. The movie is set immediately after the events of Breaking Band's finale, showcasing Jesse Pinkman in his car, driving away. It brings back the familiar faces of characters like Mike, Badger, Skinny Pete, etc. It was full of suspense, having viewers on edge about what would happen to Jesse throughout the course of the film. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, there were so many beautiful shots that could be used as a wallpaper, both as a Breaking Bad fan or in general. It was slightly comedic, but very dark. The movie is filled with flashbacks and Jesse's memories of the Neo Nazis he was forced to work for, even showcasing his good/peaceful side that shows he doesn't want violence to be his first option, yet, he needs it to be one after everything he had been through. I was originally going to watch it in theaters, but I couldn't help myself, being a huge Breaking Bad fan myself. I believe you'd love this film, if you haven't watched breaking bad, then go watch it. The show had amazing writing, acting, directing, etc. This movie is less like long Breaking Bad episode, and more like a tribute to a character who needed more closure, it closes Jesse's story well. Vince Gilligan did well in creating a continuation to a series that ended amazingly. Again, a 10/10 from me. Tried to keep it as spoiler free as possible lmao. Well as someone who really enjoyed the journey that Walter and Jesse shared in Breaking bad I gotta say this was a solid ending for the whole story.
however, this could have easily been an extra episode rather than a whole movie but i'm really glad that the whole breaking bad story is kinda finished and they are not gonna make a whole sequel of movies unlike most franchises nowadays.
Anyone who has watched the BB series should watch this just don't get your expectations too high. To those saying its "a masterpiece": It's not. There's nothing in this movie we haven't seen before and that's ok. In its context and with the background this is a solid sendoff for Jesse with some amazing moments and some good fanservice (maybe 1Â° too much for my taste).<br/><br/>It was not as good as I hoped it would be, but it's certainly a good movie and I'm happy this hasn't gone wrong.<br/><br/>Not sure if Vince is planning on doing some more of these, but I'd be down. This was very good, of course, it was always going to be. It was cool to see what happened to Jesse and also really good to see some old characters. The trouble was, Todd got fat and I couldn't get past it. I lost whole scenes thinking why couldn't he just go on a diet for like a month?<br/><br/>Anyway, it was cool and fun to go back to BB - not quite worth all the hype though unfortunately. Breaking Bad is in my opinion the best series of all time. What about a motion picture? I was wondering. It's a very successful film. Nice to see Jesse Pinkman again, b*tch! I hope the film achieves the desired success. 8/10 It just feels like an 45mins episode which is stretched for 2hrs.I think it would've been better if they had created a mini series of 3 episodes instead of a movie.In the mini series maybe they could've shown how he escaped , what he did after reaching alaska and all.
I don't know maybe its just me but this movie felt empty , like it didn't make a difference in jesse pinkman's story. Okay, so full disclosure. I am a HUGE Breaking Bad fan. I have watched the entire series three times, and then I have watched it ANOTHER SIX TIMES, skipping an episode here and there. I have turned countless people on to it, because in my opinion, anyone who has not seen it has robbed themselves. I have debated on how every single episode is a work of art. In short, in reply to the question of if I were stranded on a desert island with only one "thing" - the complete BrBa series would probably be my answer. :)<br/><br/>That said, I am not oblivious to its minor flaws. The fact that I love it so much does not mean I cannot be objective about it. It just means that it is deserving of such praise.<br/><br/>This brings me to El Camino.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No.<br/><br/>Is it riveting? Absofrickinlutely!<br/><br/>First and foremost, before watching it, the viewer needs to understand that El Camino did not have a theater opening. Vince Gilligan, and I assume everyone involved, knew what this was - and it is not meant to be a blockbuster film, but simply, the goodbye so many of us have been asking for.<br/><br/>Was this goodbye perfect? Not entirely. In my opinion, it would have gone a long way to being a WHOLE lot closer to perfect if the first 29 minutes could have been condensed into 15.<br/><br/>Those minutes kind of dragged, and while parts were moving and sweet - again, it dragged. Thank god that at 29 minutes in, it began to gain momentum, and while still slow in parts, the tension and the build-up was fantastic. Seeing most of your favorite (and hated) characters, and not only SEEING them, but FEELING your way into their minds, was amazing. (Yes, Todd IS distracting as you must have already read from other viewers). Why could they not have waited until he lost some weight? Offered him lipo? Used CGI? We'll never know - and if there is a main problem with the film, the difference in Todd is it). If one manages to put that aside, however and watch it for what it is, it is pure Breaking Bad at its best.<br/><br/>The climax is kind of difficult to explain. I guess again, it wasn't perfect, but it was SO DAMN GOOD. I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but you just have to watch it. Oh, and here, I must tell you to do yourself/yourselves a favor and avoid all kinds of spoilers about it.<br/><br/>The time leading up to the end was the best part of the entire thing. It was tasteful, poignant, touching, moving, funny ... and almost a love letter of sorts to all us fans.<br/><br/>The actual end was pretty good and almost satisfying, but in my opinion (and I think many would agree), it would have been better had another character been brought in to complete the circle, even if they had to skip to the "future". While they did touch on this story arc at the ending, it was much too vague to appreciate.<br/><br/>All in all, a solid 7.5-8, but considering it was preceded and born out of the most subtly monumental series in history, I HAD to up it to a 9.<br/><br/>Am I a fan girl? Perhaps. But the movie and above that, the series above any series ever, deserves to have fans.<br/><br/>Holy heck. I love you Breaking bad. Nice extra ending to Breaking Bad. Nothing special, just a cool way to show us that Jesse is okay and finally did what he want. Like many people, I believe that breaking bad is the best tv series of all time. Much of this credit goes to Vince Gilligan who is meticulous for detail and placing strands that eventually weave together to form a brilliantly coherent story with no stray threads. This is the main reason why I am so disappointed in El Camino:<br/><br/>With Gilligan's eye for detail, why on earth didn't he tell the actors to try to get in the same shape they were in 6 years ago? Nobody is shaming anybody for their body image, but all the comments regarding "continuity" are well founded when we are so used to masterful story telling and world building from Vince. It is distracting and takes you out of the moment.<br/><br/>The writing is also not at the level we are used to - we are made to believe that Robert Forster's (RIP) character was a true professional by insisting that Jessie pay the full amount due. I'm fine with that, BUT if you want to portray the character in this way, why on earth would he leave the vehicle that he uses to smuggle away the state's most wanted criminals in plain view at his place of business?? It makes no sense and is out of character! However, the real reason he asked for the full amount of money was so we could see Jessie have a wild west duel with a welder for some reason..... What happened with the writing here???<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's acting was very good, but I'm sorry the whole thing felt like it was made solely for the money. I understand that the reason why people work is for money (writer's, directors etc), but you should at least stick to your vision and not rush these things for a quick paycheck. Was this movie made by the same author who made Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul? Did he put less effort in this than in his average 45 minute episode? Does aging really have this rapid deteriorating effects on both the director and the actors? This movie poses so many troubling questions.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is very simple, and is delivered in a confident manner of some filler episodes of the famous series. Cameos, done as mostly flashbacks, of Mike, Heisenberg, Jane the girlfriend are all checked in an OK way. What movie lacks is interesting plot or any surprises. One particularly stupid gunfight falls far short of the standards even of filler episodes of the main series. We do not get to see what happened to Walt's family (did his plagiarizing rich friends deliver the goods etc), and closure regards mostly Jesse, but that is not the real reason the movie is so bland. One cringe worthy flashback involves fat Todd, who should have been digitalized or put on some heavy diet (as should have some other actors who aged much, deep fakes should have done the job). The one nice point was friendship of skinny Pete and Badger, but the whole thing felt like one stretched out and mostly filler episode. Quite mediocre for a feature film, and disappointing given the quality of the series, yet I will mark it a bit over what it deserves on account of good old days (should be rated much closer to the bottom objectively). Here's a honest review. It's solid but not great. It tells the story of what happens to Jesse following the events of Breaking Bad and what he needs to do to try and flee the town. If you're expecting the high octane drama of Breaking Bad, it's not here. It's a suspenseful slow-burn that left me feeling like I didn't get what I was expecting. Cool little story about Jesse, but not the fireworks that is Breaking Bad. And definitely not a 10/10 that all these moochers are giving it. It feels like a 42 minute episode was stretched to 2 hours through not-always-interesting flashbacks and filler writing. Several scenes felt stretched a minute or two longer than necessary. The result is a slowly told suspense story with Jesse encountering too many conveniently timed coincidences and hurdles, one after the other, than believable or perhaps I mean tolerable to the viewer.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the original series and consider it to be one of the best TV shows of all time. Unfortunately this latest release isn't really close to the same level of depth and creativity. I expected a better story tbh. Just wow!Vince Gilligan didn't disappoint us again. The longer I think about it, the more disappointed I get. The entire movie felt like a fan fiction. The Wild West shootout? Really? All the new characters, none of which are remotely memorable? This movie just didn't need to happen. It didn't help that the characters look visibly older (and in Todd's case, 10x fatter) which takes you out of the experience.<br/><br/>It wasn't horrible, but it isn't good enough to stand alone, nor is it up to the quality of Breaking Bad Season 5, where the franchise left off. I just wish this movie didn't happen. For me this wat a bit of a flat movie. It is more of the same of breaking bad. Nice acting, nice scenes, some twists and humour. But I had no special feeling. Yes we know now what happend to Jesse, but did I really need to know? So the urgency to see this movie is not there for me. It is nice to know but nothing more. It isnt great nor is it bad. It has been a nostalgic ride with El Camino. This was a neat continuation with a mix of flashbacks.<br/><br/>Note - while there are flashbacks these are "new" (like additional scenes on movie extras) - El Camino does not recap Breaking Bad so I recommend watching the last season first.<br/><br/>I also thought they did a good job on what seems like a "slow" reveal of Todd & Jesse's faces. I'm not 100% sure it was intentional but they didn't really reveal either actors full faces at once - so you sort of get used to that the actors have put on sobs pounds and are noticeable older. Well done here if intentional! The ending maybe? Jesse's finally free? Walter showing up in a flashback? Other than these, the movie just doesn't feel like Breaking Bad. No villains. No mind games. No chemistry/science. Just Wild West gun fight. Kind of feel like a compilation of deleted scenes. I was hoping they would write something better considering they had 6 years. Breaking Bad is in my top 3 shows of all time. I went into this with low expectations. This is something no one asked for. I wanted to like this but the movie feels empty; soulless really. It's the sequel we wanted but didn't expect. The film is promoted as being the conclusion to Jesses's story... but it feels empty and meaningless. More than half the film is flashback, while the present just doesn't go anywhere.<br/><br/>Jesse needs money to go to Alaska. That's it. That's the whole plot (if you can call it that). Loads of dead characters make an appearance but that's just so the viewer can bust their brains trying to remember how they died.<br/><br/>Unless you're a mega Breaking Bad fan, give this a miss. Complete letdown. No real drive on the story, loose ends not tied up and well, Fatt Damon says it all. All these fan boys giving it a 10 are rating with their heart and not their head. I am a massive breaking bad fan however, this really didn't cut it for me, complete disappointment. Breaking Bad is one of the best shows in the history of television, up there with the incomparable likes of Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>Despite early rumours, El Camino came absolutely out of nowhere; despite being announced in September, the hype for this was explosively high and I can honestly say that I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Gilligan's direction is assured, the pacing is consistent and intense whilst the cinematography is absolutely stunning. Aaron Paul's performance as a broken and tired Jesse Pinkman was brilliant, a flawed character who the majority, I hope, were rooting for to make it out alive and free.<br/><br/>I would familiarise yourself with the last two or three (at most) episodes of season 5 as El Camino does not recap for the audience what happened six years ago.<br/><br/>This was a truly satisfying ending to an already excellent ending.<br/><br/>8.5/10 This is everything I wanted in a Jesse Pinkman- Breaking Bad movie, and more. The Direction by Vince Gillian is fantastic, The cinematography was great, and the writing is EXCELLENT as always for Gilligan..But with all that being said, Aaron Paul is FANTASTIC in this film, like he better be nominated good.. As a Breaking Bad fan I'm super happy and as a Jesse Pinkman fan I'm an emotional wreck but super happy. This sequel-tv-movie has little to offer. Given the opportunity at hand with all the possible plots from the series to draw on, it disappoints spectacularly.<br/><br/>With its two hours, by the end of the first hour, I found myself growing worried whether any real story was going to come into play. And it really didn't go anywhere from there either. Trivial scenes that don't build any plot are stretched out way too long.<br/><br/>Cameos by several characters seem shoehorned in without merit any other than to please the fans. And in the end that's all it really does: throw nuggets of nostalgia at an underestimated audience.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but this does seem like a money grab for all involved. Just seems like Netflix made them an offer they couldn't refuse, at an artistic price they shouldn't have paid. Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" (2019) is a good movie and a good lets say 2 additional episodes of Breaking Bad. Its not that we actually needed this one, because the show has ended perfectly - i still think that its ending is the best of all time along with "Shield" (and not looking at you GOT). But that said, its still a good addition to the story, because it wrap ups Jessie's story. Its nothing groundbreaking of game changing, but if you liked the show, this movie is basically a few good episodes of BB in addition.<br/><br/>Overall, i enjoyed "El Camino" due to very same reason i loved BB series, and now enjoy "Better Call Saul" - great writing, directing and acting. This movie has it all. I feel people are expecting too much from El Camino, thinking it will have the same depth and level of character development as the entirety of Breaking Bad. The movie is about Jesse, which of course means that everything is focused upon him. Not to mention there is only so much you can squeeze into a movie, which is why El Camino spares no room for any catching viewers up on any lore, expecting viewers to know it already. Onto the movie, it is excellently written and directed by Gilligan, even with the simple premise of Jesse making his escape. The movie is very emotional for those attached to Jesse Pinkman, and it is the great and deserving send off for him that we all (most of us, anyway) wanted him to have. My only gripe is with the standoff scene which, while pretty kickass, seems contrived and out of place. Other than that, El Camino is a great experience and I absolutely recommend it to fans of the Breaking Bad series. Great to see familiar faces, except for one very large elephant in the room. Popular characters like Badger and skinny Pete were scripted brilliantly as they supported Jesse in his recovery. But just as Chuck spoiled better call Saul with too many boring narcissistic scenes, ''Fat Todd'' spoiled this film with too many baseless flashbacks. Add to that, Todd is much fatter six years later and that alone is a distraction. Shame the writers didn't think that through. Flashbacks are good when they have a purpose, but the endless Todd flashbacks just felt as if the writers were filling in the empty space. Would've been far better if it had focused more on Badger and skinny Pete helping Jesse at the beginning. - And just WHY did the film portray skinny Pete talking to the police during the trailer, but then choose not to show the actual scene in the film itself? Could have been a great film, instead it's just OK. It really was a weird experience at first. I was trying desperately to recall what happened in the final episodes of Breaking Bad but snippets came back slowly and indistinctly.<br/><br/>What wasn't indistinct was my old friendship with Jesse. Certainly a lot quieter, more introspective, but the same lovable character that visited with me for so many years. Such fond memories!<br/><br/>The best thing about rediscovering the old friendship was the delight I found in the new story. Still amazing fun, unexpected surprises and yet exactly the same. It's as if my old friend never left!!<br/><br/>What a joyous reunion!!<br/><br/>Let them back into your living room, you will be as delighted as I was!! Fan tribute film.<br/><br/>It starts with a review and continues with countless flashbacks. Bad storytelling, many implausibilities.<br/><br/>Too slow, no plot, no twists.<br/><br/>One good scene in 2h is not enough. The filmmaking itself is great as usual, camerawork etc. But basicly, it´s just a 2 hour story of Jesse getting to the disapear guy. That´s it. The Todd flashback story was pointless, nobody would have needed to see it that long - just make clear Jesse knows there´s money in the house and get over with it. The Walter flashback also seemed forced for fanservice and was, you guessed it, pointless.
The guy from the lot, asking Jesse for a duel made no sense, why would he do that after making such a big score? Cocaine does not count as complete reason for that.
The movie was just pointless. I´d prefer the´d speed up the production of the next season Better Call Saul, because really, noone needed to see 2 hours of pointless flashbacks and a little sidestory of Jesse getting to the handler. The shows end was fine. If they wanted, they could have added 5 more minutes to show him getting the money and disapearing. But stretching it out for 2 hours was pretty boring and did not deserve the Breaking Bad label. Look don't get me wrong, I loved the tv show but I can not let that alter my opinion of the film. It was a very plain film, nothing of note happened with a very below par story line which was clearly not thought out. I feel as if the film was made to make money rather than offer anything of note. After so much hype, very disappointed with the end product. This felt more like an extended episode of the show, with one glaring flaw.
Walt made the show what it was. Sure he shows up in a flashback, however, in my opinion the show had one of the greatest ending of all time, i felt Jesse's story had been wrapped up, but people demand to know what happens, that's just the way it is.
I say uneventful in my title as the whole movie is about one thing, Jesse seeks out money to give to Ed and move to Alaska.
Introduced an interesting PTSD angle, that was only an excuse to flashback to Todd.
Jesse, one of the most wanted fugitive's in USA, yet there is no police chase or confrontation.
I felt like there was something missing. I wanted to love it, but just didn't. Even the way it looked didn't feel the same, no bright popping colours, just a dull colour pallet.
And technology is amazing nowadays, you can change a 50 year old man to a teen, Christian Bale can completely transform his body, Yet neither Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons or Matt Jones could lose a bit of weight to look like they did, a little touch up in post and boom, no one would notice. This felt like a once champion boxer coming out of retirement for a final pay day.
Past his prime and not as svelt.<br/><br/>El Camino seemed to lack something Breaking Bad had, those amazing plot twists and edge of your seat moments. This is all very straight forward and uneventful.
But just being linked to Breaking Bad raises to bar of expectation I guess.<br/><br/>It is enjoyable and the acting is very good...but if it was an amphetamine, it wouldn't be blue. Todd Is thin in the series, and he's fat in the movie! I'll type it again: El Camino is to Jesse what Felina was to Walter. if you are looking for Jesse's "ending" that's what you will find and you will enjoy it! I was really hyped when I heard that there was a film about Jesse. I liked the idea of having a film and seeing what happens with Jesse.
But this movie does not really say anything about his future life. He steals some money and calls the vacuum guy to bring him to Alaska - The End
But whats the point of these senseless flashbacks? Talking to Walt, when both look actually completely different.
Actors do age in real life, so of course they do look different, so in my opinion you need to consider whether it is worth the risk loosing authenticity and just do flashbacks if they are really necessary. In this case they were just talking about small tall or whatever.
And the thing with Todd, giving him back his gun. This is the most stupid thing of BB so far. Sorry but if they are alone for the whole weekend, Jesse could have just killed him, and informed the police that Brook was in danger. The movie is a masterpiece just like the main show. Remember that joke what people used to say about GoT that it is the greatest show on earth? Good to see Jessie's story as disturbing as it was. There was no need for this movie, because it didn't bring anything new or creative to the story.
It's predictable and pretty much what everyone imagined would happen to Jessie anyways.
That being said, it's a solid movie, with strong performances, good cinematography and direction, albeit a bit slow, just like the TV show. After all the years sins breaking bad ended this is great come back really good movie great casting really good performances and script is perfect It's more Breaking Bad, which is definitely a good thing, but it doesn't really add much to the series. It has the same style, dry humour, great acting and memorable characters as the show, but without the relationship between Walter White & Jesse, it's missing a lot of what made the show great. The PTSD is well implemented and it kept me entertained, but there could have been more suspense and story in it. What you would have been saw, if there were two extra episodes after the death of Walter White? It's Jesse Pinkman's ending, right? So, El Camino is all about giving farewell to Jesse Pinkman, nothing else!! I'll start this off by saying I throughly enjoyed this movie, but it didn't really feel like much of a movie. It felt like one very long episode of breaking bad. I guess this is the result of translating a TV Series into a feature length film. It was a satisfying conclusion to Pinkmans story and I was happy I got to see that, but I feel like it should have touched more on the emotional trauma Jessie experienced. I wanted to feel more deeply for Jessie before seeing him find happiness. It felt like it glossed over a lot of what he had been going through. The flashback scenes were great and explained a good amount but I felt like the film needed to be more emotional. It was tense but I didn't really feel too much other than the tension. I don't know how I feel about this movie honestly. Maybe it's got something to do with the amount of hype and high expectations I had going into this. I almost wish the last we heard from Jessie was his final scene in the series finale. I finished the continuation of my all time favorite tv-series just 3 minutes ago and am currently fighting a man tear in the corner of my eye. "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" serves justice to both Jesse and us, the viewers. The unique vibes we grew to love so much are still there. I'm like actually quite happy at the moment (and listening to Breaking Bad soundtrack).<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Vince Gilligan has done everything right once again - here's the story Jesse deserves, here's a mood that'll suck in those to whom Vince has done it before. I'm definitely a fan of both "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul", and "El Camino" proved to be a more than just worthy addition to the canon. A slow-burning crime drama, written with heart and talent. Aaron Paul keeps up being amazing as Jesse Pinkman, there are a few surprises in form of seen and enjoyed characters and places, all of which will do nothing but entertain you, get you emotional or travel down the memory lane. All of the performances are top level, every new or familiar character works, fits into the picture. The technical side is as impressive as ever, it feels (necessarily) reminiscent of "Breaking Bad" and also a lot more cinematic at the same time. Dave Porter does his part - original score - as effective as always & Vince has kept his great taste in soundtrack choices. I get a feeling that criticising this with comparisons to "Breaking Bad" is a bit fishy, because one is a story spanning over 50 hours & the other is 2 hours. Discussions will arise. On a side note, I'm okay being called a fanboy, judged this mostly on emotions.<br/><br/>That's about all I can say without spoiling any of the fun. On one side, it feels like "El Camino" will have its share of haters soon enough - I so wish for that not to be the case, but it worries me. At one point during the second half of the movie I thought "maybe there should be something more?" but as soon as the credits rolled I was nothing but happy. I think this is the movie we (I) needed. My rating: 10/10. Is it truly objective? I kinda doubt it, but don't care either. After years of wondering ehat happened to Jesse Pinkman this movie is perfect.<br/><br/>A very good and well done farewell to a great tv show. Don't waste your time. As a breaking bad fan I watched through it to have an honest opinion. This seemed completely unnecessary and forced. I knew after they dropped a teaser about a month in advance it would never live up to having "a breaking bad story" in the title. The ending to breaking bad was epic. And as far as we knew Jesse was free. Let's just leave it there. Vince Gilligan did a wonderful job with breaking bad. Maybe he should have finished better call Saul before taking on a meaningless story with misplaced characters. Dude we appreciated what you did, please try your hand at something else. Preferably a new story line and new characters. Besides the fan service cast (which is nice to see again) and Paul who's doing a tremendous work here, the acting is pretty mediocre; the story is weak, Todd (otherwise a brilliant actor) didn't age well and has some new peculiar look and... you would have probably gotten the same result within 20 minutes of movie and not 2 hours. Breaking Bad is by far a masterpiece of storytelling while El Camino looks like a cheap B movie and says a story everyone could have lived without, with new uninteresting characters, weak story, characters far too changed 5 years later, and overall mediocre and forgettable lines.<br/><br/>I know many have been prepared to crucify the GoT calamity of an ending by praising Gilligan for making the BB ending brilliant twice - but that's not the case; I honestly regret to watching this one, there's nothing that groundbreaking in Jesse's fate that I wouldn't already figured myself (alongside every other BB fan out there).<br/><br/>5 for the fan service stuff and for a couple of good scenes that remind us about the greatest show ever written. If you look at Netflix' library of self-produced movies, it is the most bland, generic, and what has now become a predictable formula. It's not to say that their movies are actually bad, but what they usually are is soulless. Netflix movies are basically copy and paste tropes and clichÃ©s that feel like they've been written by and for dumbed down teenagers.<br/><br/>Fortunately, El Camino is noticeably a step above these. However, you can feel the apathetic and banal influence of Netflix simplifying it at times. For example, the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the movie, particularly scenes with Badger, Skinny Pete, and Joe just existed; no tension was created and it felt like cardboard cutout acting that didn't really feel like Breaking Bad- it could have been any movie if not for Aaron Paul's presence.<br/><br/>Flashback scenes with Todd had effective dark comedy and Plemons does a solid job of elaborating more on Todd's empty psychopathy.<br/><br/>Then, a pretty good scene in a battle for Todd's hidden money ensues, and the movie begins to pick up some steam. The movie finally solidifies credibility thanks to Robert Forster's excellent presence and acting experience. He nails the part once again as the vaccum clean repairman who is diversified in giving people new identities.<br/><br/>The shootout climax was excellent, and distinguished the movie as well...a movie. Prior to that some interesting stuff takes place for Jesse to reach his goals.<br/><br/>However, despite El Camino's undeniable merits and achievements, you have to wonder if somehow this movie got caught up on the Netflix conveyor belt and seasoned with generic, toned down, formulaic, palatable, perfunctory and hollow storytelling.<br/><br/>It certainly didn't challenge the mind or soul, or insist on its grit, in the way that we know Vince Gilligan and his team are capable of.<br/><br/>6.5/10 Why are people giving this title 9/10 and 10/10 I have no clue. I started my expectations at 5/10 like any other movie and it got a +1 to 6/10 because of the Breaking Bad style and vibe.<br/><br/>The movie did not surprise me in any way, shape or form and I would have been perfectly happy had it never been made. It merely provided some not even that much needed closure. Had this been the final episode of Breaking Bad all those years ago many people would have been dissapointed, now these poeple give the movie ratings like if it was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Should you watch El Camino? Id say no, even if you're a fan of Breaking Bad. You won't get enough of quality entertainment for the two hours invested. Actors and cinematography are fine (excluding Todd, which is a lot fatter than before), but the story is a waste of time.<br/><br/>It adds absolutely nothing to the story and has no appeal or whatsoever.<br/><br/>If you want to see your beloved characters again, watch recaps on YouTube. Very well made film and a great ending to the Breaking Bad saga. Aaron Paul's performance was fantastic. Thank you so much Vince Gilligan for giving us Breaking Bad. Just because there isn't a lot of action doesn't mean it's bad. The writing is on point as always. It doesn't quite play as a movie and perhaps that's why some people are disappointed. Instead it feels like a long episode, which I didn't really mind. Overall it gave jesse's story and nice wrap up, while also giving us a better understanding of what he went through in the final season. A really loved the way Vince utilizes flashbacks too As other reviewers pointed out, it's a farewell story to Jesse Pinkman. I personally love the l transition from boy to man that Jesse goes through and it's beautiful end to an otherwise tragic story of Breaking Bad. I had fun watched it, They focused on Jesse because he deserves the spot<br/><br/>Breaking bad last episodes did not focus on Jesse just Walter, and this movie is meant to be done as it declares the fate of Jesse<br/><br/>It was so good to see Walter, It actually reminded me of the franchise<br/><br/>but I thought something is missing, I wanted more, 2h in this one is not enough for me.<br/><br/>To sum up this was a good end for the franchise Breaking Bad is in my all-time top ten tv-series.(as is Better Call Saul)
Jesse Pinkman however, was never a favourite of mine. So I was a bit hesitant about this movie being about him.
Barely five minutes in I'm hooked, of course. Vince Gilligan again raises the bar, much as he did with Saul in BCS, and brilliantly fleshes out and adds to the character of Jesse in a way that at least makes me appreciate him much more this time around.
With trademark strong character-arch, brilliant plotting and all the visual Gilligan-flair we've come to expect, what's not to keep falling in love with? Probably a few too many flashbacks. Would have been nicer to see how Jesse has moved on following Breaking Bad. But none the less. A good movie. Well worth a watch if you're a fan of the series. This feels more like an extended episode than it does a movie, but I don't feel like this is necessarily a bad thing. El Camino covers Jesse's story with just the right amount of flashback scenes to paint a picture of what's been going on, without cramming in so much detail that you're left feeling it needs it own series. Lots of appearances from familiar faces but all done very fittingly and without it being 2 hours of cringeworthy and unnecessary cameos. I really enjoyed it, it's a slow burner but so was the series itself so it fits so well. It's like an additional two episodes of Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is the best TV show of the past 15 years. In comparison, El Camino falls short, defined mostly by what is missing.
It's missing the further development of Jesse, it's missing the give and take with Walter, and it relies way too much on flashbacks. Instead of taking the story forward, it's happy to coast along on its laurels. Ultimately it's not really a movie, more like a couple of unremarkable episodes of BB. A missed opportunity. Okay, I've been waiting for this movie ever since I heard the announcement and I'm to say it's lived up to its hype. The movie started off a bit slow with flashback scenes including Todd which I couldn't care of. Unfortunately, as I knew it's revealed that Walter White has died in the shootout. However as the movie progresses, the story gets really tense and really interesting. I'm glad to say Vince Gilligan has not disappointed me in the way he ended the story. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for go watch it!!! Not much of a plot this time at all. Jessie spends the whole movie trying to get money to pay the vacuum guy to take him to Alaska. The end! Hope i saved 2 hours of someones life that was gonna watch this. I was a huge breaking bad fan but this really didn't eben relate. Look, if you're expecting a thousand of revelations and exciting action-packed moments in the movie, you're going to be disappointed. Its a slow burn movie and its basically fanservice. Dont get me wrong, its cinematography is great, Aaron Paul delivers a great performance, and it's a good movie overall. It's a logical conclusion to one of the best shows of all time and you should watch it if you're a fan of Breaking Bad, just don't expect it to be as intense and action-packed as the original series. It's a good movie overall. Don't know what to think of this movie. Cameos were not needed to enhance the story, pretty dark Jesse but his best acting. Still fell it was a waste opportunity but maybe setting up a future sequel me thinks. Considering it is a movie, not a TV series, it moves considerably slower than Breaking Bad. It is a good movie but you need to have watched preferably all five seasons of Breaking Bad to fully understand and enjoy it. I would probably have rated it 6 or 7 if I had not done that. El Camino is a simple movie that does a great deal of fan service as it gives a fulfilling ending to one of our favourite characters from Breaking Bad.
The movie displays Jesse's past trauma and suffering really well and shows the damage he has undergone. The old memories of his makes us reminisce of the good times,ultimately the movie is a great way to end the Breaking Bad saga. Breaking Bad is one of the greatest T. V. shows ever made, consequences of this are that any spin off have a huge mountain to climb to match the quality.its predecessor left a few questions unanswered and this gives us an insight to Jessie's weeks following the epic finish to BB.<br/><br/>Its a solid 7 and even as a stand alone movie its not bad, but not a classic. A must (more or less) for Breaking Bad Fans There was such a buildup for this movie. It was all there, the feel, the acting and the suspense. But I think there was some magic ingredient missing. Just not quite up to par on the original series or Better Call Saul. Still worth a watch on a lazy Sunday though. I am not sure how I feel about this companion movie to BrBa. It was very atmospheric and it was nice seeing all the characters again, especially - of course - Jesse, but it was a very strange movie in that it was not driven by action or character but rather by flashback; flashback that felt a little writer indulgent -Gilligan regretting not using Todd more during the series - rather than used to provide meaningful insight on Jesse and his struggle with all those inner demons that seemed magically resolved by the start El Camino or shortly after his shower.<br/><br/>I would say this movie is not necessary viewing for BrBa fans. Jesse's ending in Felina is actually more beautiful. But if you are curious... it has its moments. Just be forewarned that it has an odd thrust and don't expect a lot of character development or for the movie to answer deep questions such as: Did Jesse forgive Walt? Not a stand alone movie, but a cool two-hour, episode 63 of the "Breaking Bad" franchise, "El Camino" offers up the goods and the bads from whence Vince Gilligan last left us dangling. Anyone not on the binge brigade, or at least a thorough background check, will be confused as hell, but there ya go.<br/><br/>Spinning the cameras and focusing directly on the forgotten partner in crime, Gilligan ties up several loose ends whilst orchestrating Jesse Plinkman's desperate life scramble. As the simple, misguided but driven teen, Aaron Paul's character required as big a stretch as Bryan Cranston's Walter White, and his scattered, jig-sawed story ached to be flushed out.<br/><br/>Several forgettable Hollywood missteps in the interim showed Paul just can't shake Jesse. It's who he does best. It is who he is. Bad news for him, good news for us. We know what we are getting - danger, suspense, action and a bit of cleverness - and are super comfortable with it.<br/><br/>In a wonderful send off bonus, there is a delicious last turn from Robert Forster as a congenial vacuum salesman slash fixer, who absolutely kills it, without, er actually doing any killing.<br/><br/>Everything comes together perfectly. "El Camino" carries on the visceral tradition of the series with carefully paced adventure, saturated colours, bleak landscapes, and rigidly masculine performances. All that's missing is the horses.<br/><br/>Giddy-up. As a huge breaking bad fan I'm grateful for any extra content and did enjoy this but whilst it was good it was nothing spectacular and could have been a lot better but was nice to see Jesse back on the screen one last time. I totally loved it. Breaking Bad was without a doubt one of the best series ever made and El Camino truly honours it. Aaron Paul gives a tremendous final performance as Jessie Pinkman and I so was happy to see his final story told so well. A big thumbs up. Don't listen to the numerous reviews out there with buzzwords like "masterpiece" and "perfection" Seriously, what is it with people and using two overused terms to describe things? People really need to expand their vocabulary to review something.<br/><br/>Let's face it, BB was a great TV show.<br/><br/>This movie was completely unnecessary but was a decent enough watch but it's nowhere near the quality that you'll see from the VG fanboys that kiss the ground he walks on<br/><br/>Here;s all you need to know:<br/><br/>Decent story
Engaging acting
World class cinematography
Epic soundtrack<br/><br/>That said, it comes off as pure fanservice and a cashgrab at that Total let down! This was slow, boring, & pointless IMHO! Almost fell asleep & a waste of an evening! They could have done so much better & so much more!! Six years ago we saw the end of the story of Walter White, El Camino - the end of Jesse Pinkman story. It was fantastic! El Camino was a fantastic little film to give fans a bit of closure with jessie pinkman and I enjoyed it very much. The only tiny thing that let me down was that Jesse Plemons didn't loose any weight for the flashbacks and it was incredibly distracting considering the timeline it was meant to be set in. Other than that absolutely fantastic! Let me start off by stating that this is a good movie. Aaron Paul's acting, as always, is excellent to say the least, and it was awesome to see him back in his iconic role of Jesse Pinkman. Also great to see some of the old familiar faces of the series again as well, and to see what exactly became of Jesse after his escape from his time as a slave cook that we saw at the end of the series. So obviously, and understandably, I went in to this with VERY high expectations, I went in with Breaking Bad level expectations, which in hindsight may have caused an issue, because while as I stated it's a good movie. It's not great or phenomenal in the way that BB consistently was. It didnt have that same suspense, drama, and edge that the series was so well known for in my opinion, and didn't pull me in the same way either. Like I mentioned, it's great to see what happened to Jesse after his escape and get some real closure, but at the same time I don't feel as though this actually did the character complete justice. I think it could have been a lot better and more intriguing if I'm being honest. Breaking Bad always had me on the edge of my seat and on my toes, constantly guessing and speculating what crazy s*** was going to happen next. El Camino didn't do that for me. I found it much more predictable and lackluster. I truly don't recall even one single moment in the entire 2 hours in which I genuinely had no idea what was going to happen next. Which is a total 180 from how BB was, where I was constantly being shocked and surprised when crazy s*** went down. Don't get me wrong, because like I said, it is still a good movie. But if you go in to it looking for that same thrill that BB gave you week after week, if you are anything like me, you are probably going to be disappointed if I'm being honest, because I was definitely let down at the overall quality. Nice to have little more of Breaking Bad but still it is not the same. If you are just looking to see Aaron Paul and a few other BrBa actors in character one more time then this movie is fine. The actors, of course, look different and so, at times, it is almost like a watching a re-union special or a skit
.
Story-wise, it is glaringly obvious that Mr. Gilligan had nothing post-Felina left to tell; however, what was put on screen seemed to be done with affection for the BrBa world and the fans. So, there is that. I'll say that I'm not the biggest BB fan. It was good, but no Sopranos. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting for this movie, but it wasn't this.<br/><br/>Dramas are built up around characters. In this, you have Jessie, a few smaller callbacks but nothing that feels meaty. The whole thing just feels like a single episode and more must be coming to substantiate what we saw. I'm not sure this stands on its own that well. I expected more Even though it does bring back many characters of BB, it isn't as good as the TV show. I'm not saying I hate everything about this movie. No, actually the cinematography is absolutely beautiful, the colors, the acting...everything besides the storyline itself.
It was so so so predictable, it hurts a little bit...It's just a 2-hours long movie about a guy who is trying to find a certain amount of money. And then he manages and - poof - happy ending. I personally reckon that the ending of BrB was far more impactful and deep. I still remember how I felt watching the last episode.....it just hits you like a train how evil Walter was and how this affected everyone that was even slightly related to him. It was heavy but also the best ending of a TV show in the history!
El Camino is just another way to win some money but all due respect it doesn't add anything valuable to the already existing story. Not worth watching, if you ask me. Solid ending to Breaking Bad, the film itself is good, it wasn't just worth waiting 5 years for it. I am a huge Breaking Bad fan and was so much looking forward to this follow up movie. But I have never been more disapointed in my life! This was complete garbage and there was not a single enjoyable minute in this entire movie. Total bummer. Well, I was expecting more, it was not that great compared to the series, you know, in each episode we were shocked somehow , in this movie you will not be.. DO NOT expect this movie to be better than Breaking Bad!!<br/><br/>We could not expect anything less from Vince Gilligan, but somehow he always manages to exceeds our expectations by creating something even better than what we can imagine. El Camino is a fine resemblance of what Breaking Bad was as a series. Perfect cinematography, drama and suspense at times.
It's the Farewell we all wanted for Jessie
Didn't want it to end. Too short. Thankfully We still have Better Call Saul as our last Breaking Bad masterpiece A feature-length sequel to the "Breaking Bad" TV series, "El Camino" is an otherwise-pointless exercise in fan servicing. Besides the, by TV standards, sensationalism of an anti-hero and drug-and-murder-related subject matter, "Breaking Bad" was effective because of dramatic character development and the downward spiral of character interactions, as Walter White set out, originally, to help his family, but left everyone close to him worse off in his wake. The one beacon of hope was Jesse Pinkman driving away from the crime scene and his imprisonment. Nothing in "El Camino" can compare to the wonder of what the audience imagined his future may entail after finally being set free from his association with "Heisenberg" and the underworld of crystal meth. Not only that, but this movie doesn't even try to; it's entirely concerned with elaborating on the details of his escape, as, apparently, there's an extensive police manhunt for him, as well as with him revisiting other characters from the show, the living or, thanks to flashbacks, the dead, and it ends essentially where it began, with Jesse driving away to the promise of a brighter future.<br/><br/>It's two hours of no character development and needless plot development informed by flashbacks mundane enough that one would've believed they were cut from the original show if not for the obvious aging of the cast. Briefly, Jesse's PTSD holds the promise of something new, but that storyline is dropped as soon as he finishes a shower. There's some attempt to create grander vistas to justify the movie's limited theatrical release, and there are intentional references to the Western genre, but it's all pretty pathetic. The Western-style shootout even comes across as unimaginative compared to the elaborate schemes Walter came up with during the series, from the train heist to a machine gun booting out of his car. Worst of all are Jesse's reunions with other members from the cast, which tend to elaborate on the same theme of what's next for Jesse. It's the worst sort of repetitiveness and cameos for the sake of cameos characteristic of TV programs--especially ones worse than "Breaking Bad," which was supposed to be one of the more-cinematic TV shows. It's ironic, then, that now that the TV show-turned-franchise has debuted in feature-length form and theatrically, it turns out to be, for the most part, anti-cinematic. This was an excellent conclusion to Jesse's story as well as being a brilliantly made film. I absolutely loved this film and left me completely satisfied and I am sure any other Breaking Bad viewers will feel the same. 10/10 Direction, cinematography, writing, and acting, brilliant all round. My review has been brought down to a 9 only because I believe a non breaking bad viewer, may find it difficult to care about the story and the many flashbacks. I know when we are excited and have high expectations, we will be easily disappointed as we were here... however I went on and had time to think about what I watched and what extra did I come to learn about Jesse... really there was nothing.<br/><br/>nothing new at all... the rescue of Jesse at the last episode of breaking bad made it clear that Jesse ran away...<br/><br/>with connections around we have solely figured it out and was more beautiful the way we imagined him escape...<br/><br/>There was nothing to add here, seriously nothing. We see Aaron Paul carry a movie with ease, with way better acting than when he pretty much relied on coolness (towards the last couple of seasons, he had clearly improved as well).
But other than that, it's well written "thrilling" final escape from the autor of our Jesse.
It doesn't look cheap like other Netflix productions, but it also lacks artistic flair, in my opinion. There is little different from the tv series and it really looks what it is, a good tv movie.
Some intense moments, yes, but also not enough emotion or emotional last character development for Jesse, in my opinion. A lacking experience in that sense (I was waiting for something BIG to happen to Jesse and change him forever, but It just didn't, I don't think).
The movie is like two or three Breaking Bad episodes, just not the best ones. This was kind of what I expected: fan service without any original idea or overall theme. It serviced the characters. It was like three mediocre episodes of Breaking Bad. I wasn't all that interested in the villains Breaking Bad ended up with and the earlier seasons had much better ones. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that this show had us stuck with a lot of the same one-dimensional characters from the last season. Everyone already knows going in that most of the interesting people are dead. It would have been better, perhaps, if it STARTED where it ended. I think this movie is more evidence of how quality has declined in this oversaturated market. A 2hour movie that can be summed up in a paragraph. There is no story here.
The actors are looking nothing like in the series. The flashbacks are terrible.
The composition and framing of the shots is nice. I was a huge breaking bad fan when the show started, and was a huge fan through and through, through out it's 5 seasons. The ending was perfect, but it ultimately led us to wonder what ever happened to Jesse Pinkman?<br/><br/>This film 'El Camino' which was written and director by the shows main Producer Vince Giligan shows us the aftermath of that faithful night, and takes us through the run away journey of what Jesse Pinkman did afterwards....Which wasn't really much.<br/><br/>The film's 2 hour length was not needed, and for a director and writer who would combine so much into one episode of a Breaking Bad, ultimately failed into giving us a 2 hour film that at least would contain the story of Pinkman's runaway.<br/><br/><ul><li>The film really doesn't add much to Jesse\s ultimate journey to find himself, it shows us the torturing he endured under Todd, but really that's it.</li></ul><br/><br/>Its like as if the film did not know where to go, and was stretched too long for absolutely nothing. This 2 hour film could have been crunched to a single 45 minute episode, if that. There was no real antagonist, and the film just dragged on for nothing.<br/><br/>The flashback scenes gave you a deeper look into where the show hadn't provided explanation but ultimately for a film that was branded on wild man hunt for Jesse Pinkman, it failed to reach it's main objective of storytelling.<br/><br/><ul><li>A film that wasn't needed but many were asking for, it does provide you a conclusive ending, but it just didn't needed to get done.</li></ul><br/><br/>Perhaps Vince was trying to go for a more artistic approach, which would have been fine, we don't need massive kills, like his previous series gave us, but it also didn't give a whole lot of storytelling either.<br/><br/>find a recap of what happened and watch that , it can literally explain to you what exactly happened in the film, and waste only 5-10 minutes of your time. but this film was stretched out for longer than it needed to be.<br/><br/>I would have been fine with them not making the film, the show provided a nice ending and ultimately perhaps tarnishes it a bit. Sometimes certain things are better lft untouched.<br/><br/>This is one of those things.<br/><br/>3.2 / 5 or 5 / 10
Respect the series, pointless film. It was always a risk continuing the story of one of the best TV shows ever made however, the brilliant mind of Vince Gilligan delivers. I loved the way the series finished and I was a bit sceptical of a breaking bad movie but the series was a conclusion for Walt, not Jesse. This film is like the desert after you've enjoyed a full meal. El Camino is the perfect conclusion to what Felina was to Walt. Our Jesse Pinkman finally got a proper closure. He deserved it after all the hardships and heartbreak he witnessed. First his parent's disownment, then Jane, then Andrea, then the cage. It's like I am putting it nicely and skipped a lot but Jesse have seen it all.<br/><br/>Skinny Pete and Badger are the only people that kept him going. A big amount of respect for both of them, especially Skinny.<br/><br/>I was really excited about this movie, I legit watched the whole series all over again before the release. I won't say I am disappointed but I expected more.<br/><br/>I mean why the chubby Todd? And Walter White's artificial bald. Why did the makers missed making these details a little more perfect.
Moreover, in the trailer we saw Skinny Pete's interrogation and it seems to be missing in the original movie. But the makers did deceived us in the trailer when they showed Mike's and Jesse's conversation, I really thought that, that badass Mike might be back. Another scene in the trailer when somebody says "Are you ready?", most of us must have thought that was Walter White right? In the movie you are going to witness this scene as a Wild West competition and hell Jesse nailed it! Yo Bi*ch'<br/><br/>Me expecting more with this movie would just be overstating as they really covered everything and kept it simple at the same time. Of course you are not going to find this movie as intense as the last season of Breaking Bad but it is really an awesome 2-hour watch.<br/><br/>Overall I am now at peace and so is Jesse Pinkman. Redemption doesn't seem like the theme the name Breaking Bad sets out to deliver. And depending on your idea of redemption, maybe this isn't even that, maybe moving on is a better way to describe it. Jesse went from a practically teenage Captain Cook living an oblivious New Mexico existence slinging Chilli-P, to a well rounded humbled adult who just wants to be free to chose his own path. El Camino means exactly that. If you are looking for a standalone feel good movie of the year you have wandered into the wrong yard. This is a direct continuation of Breaking Bad that allows us peaks at what comes after for Jesse. It also plays on nostalgia through flashbacks and never before seen scenes with characters like Mike, Todd, and even Walt. If you love Breaking Bad this is eye candy. Just imagine if Felina part 2 and 3 combined into 1 long episode, and focus primarily on Pinkman. We don't get many White family nods or updates, or a crossover from Saul as a Cinnabon fishing criminal lawyer. This stays true to the aftermath of the series in a dark way that also feels as light as possible in Jesse's current world. I appreciate the courage it took to make this, and believe when you simply attach it as the finale of Breaking Bad, it still completes the whole. On its own you may not see it as groundbreaking. On its own you may not be satisfied if you expect anything but a man who was held captive as a hostage and the things one has to escape to move forward from that. Jesse accepts his fate, the one that truly tortured him throughout the series... he finally chose what he wanted to do over what anyone else tried to force or manipulate him to do. Unlike the arch of Walt or even Saul, Jesse finds experience and swallows it to do something different. He chooses not to go further down the rabbit hole until it consumes him completely. He was the ying to Walt's yang because of that.<br/><br/>True fans will get why this movie is not flashy, not just a romp with light hearted nods at bad things that happened, because the human experience is more than a line in a passing moment. It doesn't search for nostalgia. It tells the linear story of Jesse after Walt. One where he can breathe and have his own frontier. Breaking bad is one of the best. To earn money using the name of breaking bad is one of the biggest mistake.<br/><br/>This was really a b movie, sorry to say. El Camino is a movie that garnered a MASSIVE amount of hype and rightfully so. However, I feel as though it really didn't live up to it.. at all. It was so great getting to see Jesse again, along with tons old faces like Walt, Jane, Mike, Skinny Pete, & Badger. It was awesome to step back into the world of Breaking Bad for a few hours, but the movie itself wasn't that amazing. The whole movie can probably be summarized in two to three sentences..<br/><br/>I did still enjoy watching El Camino and liked the movie, but again it didn't come anywhere close to living up to the hype it had. Jesse was always the nicer guy.
If there weren't walt, he would not have involved in any mess.
He couldn't even kill an insect.
Same thing is shown, in Elcamino where he refuses to use gun as much as possible untill a point wherr it comes to do or die
He never wanted mess, he never wanted money ( shown as him throwing the money away in the series), he never wanted violence.
He was trying to get out entire season 5 but somehow because of Walt, he could not.
So this movie is all about what Jesse would do without walt and correctly it would be boring life all about survival.
Don't take it as a movie, take it as 62+2 added episodes.
This is only to give justice to jesse's character arc which was incomplete.
Those who want a lot of thrill and excitement may get a little disappointed. Breaking Bad is one of my favorite TV shows. Everything about the show is great: the characters, the performances, the story, the writing, the ending, the music, I could go on and on.<br/><br/>When I found out Vince Gilligan was making a movie about what happens to Jesse Pinkman after the series finale, I was excited. I wasn't expecting El Camino to be as good as Breaking Bad, but I hoping it would at least be a decent action thriller.<br/><br/>However, by the time El Camino ended, I felt very underwhelmed. While the movie was well-shot and well-acted, I found myself bored throughout most of the movie. El Camino is over two hours long, but not much happened in the story.<br/><br/>I think my initial expectations were a major factor to my disappointment. Like I mentioned earlier, I was expecting El Camino to be a fast-paced action thriller similar to The Fugitive. Instead, what I got was a slow burn drama. It would be nice giving El Camino another watch with this in mind, but I don't really feel like revisiting the movie any time soon.<br/><br/>Overall, El Camino was a meh epilogue to an amazing show. The movie had great cinematography and acting, but the story was very slow and boring. My final rating for El Camino is a 5/10 with no recommendation. I consider Breaking Bad the best series ever made. I absolutely loved the show and when i saw a trailer about a sequel movie i was so freaking excited. The movie delivers just fine for all the hype produced. I'm not going into further details, cause if you are a true BB fan then you'll like every minute of the movie. If you're not a fan then you wouldn't be watching it at all. Breaking bad? Legendary. New movie spinoff? Absolute trash and waste of my life getting hyped for months. 15 mins were left and I thought something must be wrong, but nope it just ended and it went on without any inspiration or change at all. This movie should not be compared to breaking bad series. It is not possible to achieve its level in just two hours. But everyone was expecting something better. The real problem is that there is no plot at all and the secondary characters are non existing (they just appear for a couple of minutes and then the movie moves on).<br/><br/>What bothered me the most was that they even deleted a scene from a teaser that could have change the plot, or making it more interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe it would have been better to produce a miniseries, with 3 chapter aprox, and avoid calling this a "movie"<br/><br/>Finally the "1" rating is just to compensate those stupid fanatics that vote "10 " for being a "breaking bad movie" and are not capable of analysing a movie leaving their passions asside. This happens in every tv series, and in a lot of movies, unfortunately.
My real rating would be a 5. This movie should have taken place right after the series. Characters had all aged. And the writers expected us not to notice. Story was good, but the timing was not. Unfortunately comparying breaking bad series to the movie would make the movie looks so boring....second when you do movie you must make with faster tempo...this movie started with very slow and less intense than it should be that is why it looks bad in comparison to the series Great, just like the episoden. Natural story forwards. Breaking Bad is the best show ever made. El Camino did a proper farewell to Jesse Pinkman and also to the masterpiece that is Breaking Bad. The movie is not a 10/10, but it is worth it. It was nice to see Jesse and the other characters again. Thank you Vince Gilligan and a big thank you too to the cast of the series/movie for everything you gave us When I first saw El Camino, I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed after seeing it. I knew I still enjoyed it but I was expecting much much more then what the movie laid out. But after some thinking and a few rewatches I noticed my mistake, I was pretty much expecting another Breaking Bad. I was expecting the same thrills and high octane action that Breaking Bad provided, and while yes you still get action and thrills it's a much more contained movie then that. It's pretty much it's own character study of Jesse Pinkman. And that's perfectly fine, It's great actually! El Camino taught me that It's better to always keep an open mind when seeing movies cause they won't always be the same as their counterparts. And in the end I'm glad I didn't get another Breaking Bad, otherwise this movie would 1) have no reason to exist and 2) It wouldn't be special. El Camino is very much like a series in that there's always more coming. This comes at a cost tho, in my opinion it lacks a good story line, it's pretty much just Jesse traveling around the city slowly recovering from his trauma. A few trowbacks sprinkled in between wakes some nostalgia, but they don't add much more. Watching the movie is entertaining, although it ends up feeling a bit bland. Anyways, it's still worth a watch especially if you've watched the Breaking Bad series. Seeing as how Breaking Bad is considered of the masterpiece TV dramas of all-time, returning to that exact source is always going to be a bit tricky. Will the material land the same way it did when the show originally aired? Will the characters still be as relevant? Sure, Better Call Saul has nipped at the fringes of the Breaking Bad-verse, but "El Camino" picks up right where the main show's finale leaves off. Overall, while a nice little coda to the story of Jesse Pinkman, there was also nothing spectacular or particularly memorable about it.<br/><br/>For a basic overview, "El Camino" is told in a sort of dual-narrative fashion. In the "present", or directly after the events of Felina (the BB finale), Jesse (Aaron Paul) initially shows up on the doorstep of Badger (Matt Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker), having just escaped the neo-Nazi cage he had been trapped in. All Jesse wants to do is start a new life for himself, but for that plan to work he needs to come up with the requisite amount of cash to pay "Ed the Vacuum Cleaner Guy" (Robert Forster) to make him disappear. The rest of the story is told in flashbacks, especially relating to Jesse's interactions with Todd (Jesse Plemons) while imprisoned.<br/><br/>I think the hallmark of "El Camino" is that it is the first piece of the Breaking Bad universe that gives a happy (or at least peaceful) ending to one of its characters. Walter White obviously went too far down the rabbit hole for redemption in BB, while even as likable as Slippin' Jimmy can be in BCS, viewers know what he ultimately ends up as in BB (a corrupt lawyer). Here, though, the character of Jesse Pinkman is given a redemptive arc, and that positivity is much-needed for a show known for its cruelly realistic character endings.<br/><br/>"El Camino" does enough things right to be enjoyable. Clearly Vince Gilligan still has the knack for creating that "BB feel", mixing dumb humor with incredible tension. Paul is an incredible actor (and it shows here), and it gives some nice call-back cameos to Mr. White (Bryan Cranston), Mike Ehrmantrout (Jonathan Banks), and even Jane (Krysten Ritter).<br/><br/>That being said, the whole exercise also felt a bit predictable. It opens with a flashback of Mike and Jesse talking about absconding to Alaska and, well, wouldn't you know, that's kind of how things end up. There's also little doubt that Jesse will not overcome the situations he is put into throughout the film. A particular fly in the ointment might be the amount of time spent on/with the Todd character. Those scenes really slowed the narrative to a halt and, with a couple of exceptions, didn't offer nearly as much good, meaty dialogue or plot as basically everything else present.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to say that the last 30-or-so minutes of "El Camino" really redeemed the experience for me. It seemed to take a long time to shift into gear (pardon the pun), but when it did I was transfixed. Personally, I still prefer the BCS "nip at the fringes" approach to the BB universe rather than this legitimate sequel, but there isn't anything here to completely turn me off to it, either. El Camino fully focuses on Jesse Pinkman. It farewells Jesse Pinkman. The movie is basically about Jesse. There was a lot of hype about the movie. But it is not that good. If it is a Breaking Bad continuation why nothing was told about Walter's family ? or Marie ? The movie missed alot of things. I would say that it ended on a cliff hanger. We got no information on Saul, Skyler, Walter Jr or any of the main characters. This is really disappointing, otherwise the movie is good. I don't know what Vince Gilligan has in mind. Maybe he will tell about Walter's family in the upcoming seasons of Better Call Saul. Anyway, i recommend you to watch this movie ! It just felt like a few extra episodes which is great but I expected more from it. I suggest watching but not with high expectations. Wow I was really close to suicide but this movie brought me back to reality, it made me realize what was important in life. How even during your hardest struggles you have to live, persevere and sometimes make decisions that are for the greater good even if it causes the most painful experience. This is the perfect ending to the greatest television series ever created. God bless Vince Gilligan. Ig- yaotii xxochipan It was a beautiful way to send off Pinkman that we didn't get in the original show. Aaron Paul did an amazing job at being a tortured Pinkman, a man desperate to leave his past in the past. All of the Breaking Bad actors and directors did very well for the most part. But having Netflix involved in your movie is a recipe for disappointment. It's like having the Mexican Cartel cook your meth in Don Eladio's dirty Mexican lab with no phenylacetic acid. The purity of your product is bound to decline.<br/><br/>Netflix shows and movies always obtain a formulaic, lazy, and soulless final product. They essentially imitate the formula of other good movies by aping a systematic approach to filmmaking. They just spit out movies like they're nothing: "It's just another movie", but they have no uniqueness, no achievement, and nothing memorable, just one clichÃ© after another. They also feel lazy and choppy.<br/><br/>El Camino is not a bad movie, but it's not one that can ultimately make a mark. This will be the last time I ever spend money on a NF streaming membership. I can't wait until the new streaming sites are up and running to better the competition. This movie should have been made for a big studio or for AMC only. The acting was good but was it really necessary to make this movie? I mean it's just like 2 BB episodes and almost add nothing to storyline.
1 star for arron Paul acting This masterfully done continuation of the Breaking Bad finale doesn't dumb things down for the mainstream, it doesn't rush or stick to a traditional formula.. and all of the characters get tons of room to breathe. This is Breaking Bad without limitation - and a heart-wrenching character study into one of the greatest TV characters ever written.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's performance is phenomenal. In fact, all returning characters gave incredible performances here.<br/><br/>The tension is palpable from frame-to-frame. The music is subtle and very effective. Logical, intelligent writing. Exceptional acting. Beautiful, charismatic cinematography. Fan service done in a tasteful manner, with a little bit of depth added to some iconic moments from the show.<br/><br/>Yes, one could argue that El Camino is an "unnecessary" expansion pack, simply filling a gap which was already filled in fans' imaginations.. but the quality of this execution cannot be argued with. Vince Gilligan's care and respect for Breaking Bad is to be admired.. because it's almost impossible to believe this wasn't filmed right after Felina. Vince Gilligan clearly stopped at nothing to get the details right.<br/><br/>For me, El Camino is a near masterpiece.. only held back by one plot thread which I feel could have been trimmed down.<br/><br/>The slow burn may lose your casual viewer, but for fans like me who lived and breathed the series; El Camino is the extra layer of icing on the cake. Before i watched the movie i hope to see walter white in this movie but when i saw him i said why you did this?...you are ending so great to see even your flashback. There wasn't really any theme to the movie. I expected more than just showing us how Jesse escaped and moved on. Vince Gilligan doesn't give you what you want, he gives you a brilliantly told story that the characters deserve. That's the end of Jesse Pinkman, just watch him for the last time and don't criticize his ending, because no one knows how to make the right closure batter then Vince, like it or hate it, he has done right with his characters. Very disappointing. It's more like a nostalgic scenes pasted together. No difference from the videos we see on this page and recall the story.
Everyone knows that Jesse escaped after the last episode and nothing new offered in the movie!
Was expecting much more from Vince Gilligan after this long wait. 😏 Typical writing, directing, acting of the series... which is a great thing. But so much of this movie felt forced. Admittedly that could all be from cramming this into a 2 hour movie.<br/><br/>Sure it could have benefit from being moved to say a single season of a show. But Better Call Saul kinda turned to mush when they stretched that out too far. I also can't blame the cast and crew for doing it as one shot and done.<br/><br/>I'm also torn on the reason for this movie. Did we need closure to the Jessie Pinkman story? And was this even closure? It felt like it was no closer to and end that when it began.<br/><br/>All that aside it wasn't a bad movie at all. I think my expectations were too high for this movie. It was a solid one time watch film but something was lacking. The film was a slow burner and it didn't have enough of the old characters from the show for my liking. It's almost like we could've predicted the outcome of the movie after the show ended by using our imagination. Aaron Paul was great and in general the acting was fine, but it didn't have the spark I was expecting. This film is such a disappointment. Where's the structure. It's riding on the back of Breaking Bad. It pales in comparison to what is generally accepted as the one of the best series ever. The film flits from one unrelated episode to another. The number of flash backs is irritating. Why didn't the makers admit this is an extended trailer for a Jesse Series There's no question about it - this movie is a giant cash grab was solely made for fan service.<br/><br/>And for what it was, it was good. This movie closes out the story of Breaking Bad after the show left everything except the Neo Nazis and Walt's fates undetermined. Some would even say Walt's fate was also left undetermined.<br/><br/>However, if you are not a fan of Breaking Bad, this movie is mediocre at best. Why would anyone watch this if they didn't care about Breaking Bad? I don't know. Even though it is basically a two hour episode of BB, it was released as its own movie and I will review it as such.<br/><br/>Firstly, this movie did not contain any character development whatsoever. It opens with Jesse on the lam after taking the El Camino in the final episode of the show. Jesse is the same person he was at the beginning, at the end. It doesn't show a different side of any characters, just cameos saying the same thing that the show offered.<br/><br/>Then - the cameos are nothing but fan service, to see these same people in these same roles again. Walt, Todd, Mike, Jane, even Jesse himself look 5-10 years older. Their participation in the film didn't even throw back to the show, really. The only really relevant one was Todd and that was manufactured just a little too conveniently.<br/><br/>Which brings us to my biggest gripe: it's too convenient. Every cameo, every piece of information you are given, relates to this story and only to this specific story. It does not tie back to the larger series really at all and everything was just a little too convenient. All of a sudden there's a hidden money reserve we know nothing about? I'm sure there are some Easter eggs I missed, but this felt unnecessarily convoluted. You could've taken everything out except the trip with Todd and the story would've been done in 30 minutes and made the same amount of sense as it did in the full movie.<br/><br/>Not well put together, not well acted, and overall just not a good movie.<br/><br/>As a Breaking Bad fan, I saw it for what it was: cash grab and can service. And treating it as an episode of BB, I enjoyed it that way. As a movie, though, it doesn't stand up to even the most mediocre of movies. When rumours first began to circulate that there was a Breaking Bad film in development, I was apprehensive to say the least. Breaking Bad is lauded as one of the greatest television series of all time, having been nominated for a staggering 58 Emmy awards and gaining a widespread following of dedicated fans. As the series approached its final chapter, many of these fans were surely concerned that the show could never produce an ending that would live up to the near perfection of the series as a whole. And yet, the show's conclusion in 2013 was met with almost unanimous acclaim, a feat that seems even more impressive when compared with the mixed reception to the endings of similarly popular shows such as Game of Thrones. Somehow, Vince Gilligan and the rest of the team behind Breaking Bad had achieved the impossible. And so, it is no wonder that I was mystified and slightly concerned by the decision to try and end the show for a second time, given how hard it is to end a show once.<br/><br/>However, El Camino somehow manages it. From the outset, it is clear that Vince Gilligan is once more in the director's chair, with familiarly well-crafted shots that welcome the audience back to the Breaking Bad universe. Everything is as we left it and Aaron Paul relaxes into the persona of Jesse Pinkman seamlessly, despite the six-year time-gap between the show's 2013 finale and now. Of course, there are some changes: Bryan Cranston's Walter White is absent from this film apart from flashbacks, perhaps generating concern as to whether the series would retain its draw without its cherished lead. Aaron Paul nullifies such concerns immediately, through a powerful and moving performance as Jesse in a post-Walter White world. The film follows Jesse's final gruelling steps towards freedom in the wake of White's death, coupled with visceral flashbacks to his recent spell in captivity at the hands Jack Welker's white supremacist gang. Jesse Plemons reprises his role in flashbacks as the sociopathic Todd Alquist, whose childlike approach to violence creates a disturbing atmosphere, reminding us of what Jesse is running from. Other veterans of the series return in touching cameos, often acting as reflections of Jesse's inner questions about who he is and where he wants to go next. However, by the end of the film, many of these questions are still unanswered, even if we have a better idea of where Jesse is heading. For me, this is the main issue with El Camino-- it simply does not answer enough of the 2013 finale's lingering questions to justify its existence.<br/><br/>At the end of Breaking Bad, we were left with an ambiguous ending for Jesse: he had stolen a car and was driving at full throttle towards freedom. He was finally liberated from imprisonment and it seemed clear he had no plans of ever returning. We had no idea what he planned to do next, where he wanted to go or who he wanted to become. The end of El Camino does not change this: we get to see his first steps as a somewhat free man (physically if not mentally) and his success in evading capture and generating enough funds to purchase the new life he so desperately desires. As such, the film ends with Jesse once again driving off into the distance, a few steps closer to freedom but no less far away from answers about his future or what he plans to do next. The ending is ambiguous, just as it was before. It feels as though El Camino should have been included in the finale, since it essentially deals with the administrative side of starting a new life. If it had then ended with that same scene from 'Felina' in 2013, with Jesse driving away to freedom, I doubt many fans would have noticed a difference. The film continues the current cinematic trend of releasing prequels or sequels that explain elements of a story that did not need explaining, without adding any new information or substance to the original material. It is therefore unsurprising that the film has received positive critical reception from most who have seen it, since it is essentially the same ending served up twice, this time with a behind-the-scenes look at how it happened. The movie was good but not great. It felt slow and uneventful, given the nature of breaking bad and even better call Saul it just seemed like a very long episode with not much action. It tried to capture on the fans by showing flashback of previous characters but it just didn't follow a traditional breaking bad episode. I just turned it of halfway. Not worth your time. There is completely nothing to see here. I even don't know why they made this movie. Well, a short story. This could be the next "Final episode" of BB series but not movie at all. Lets be honest, in first hour u have no action at all. The movie is for solid 7(not even deserved 7 star) but i need to be less objestive and give it a 8 cuz i love BB series and acters. In a sense the movie ends the way the show ends... with Jesse riding off into the sunset. Yes the movie answers some questions and fills in some holes from the show. Overall I wasn't blown away from the movie. It was entertaining, I miss the show, so it was nice to see something from that realm, but I'm not going to watch this on repeat. This works well as a sequel to Breaking Bad, and if you (like me) have seen the series, I think you will appreciate it. Quite enthralling; the two hours of its duration felt shorter. But on the other hand, I think it works *only* in connection with Breaking Bad. Viewers who are not familiar with the series might find it confusing, I suppose, and the many flashbacks can't really cover up the fact that the story of this movie, in itself, is rather thin. But I *do* recommend it for Breaking Bad fans and because of Aaron Paul's convincing acting skills. In short, I am just gonna say that Breaking Bad didn't need another closure. At the end Jesse Pinkman was freein BB, and this movie was just so much predictable, I think it's a good movie for those who are missing the characters Closes the story of Pinkman. We can tale this movie as a final episode of BrB.
Doesn't have more than a review of the events in the serie, and is the way out of a character who everyone asking about in the end. Along with most people I was a huge fan of the show. Best on TV in many people's opinions. Unfortunately my memory of the minor characters is somewhat blurry as Breaking Bad finished six years ago. I found myself wondering if these characters were seen before, if I should know them. Who's that? and so on. There is also many flashback scenes to confuse further as the actors have aged and it can be difficult as to know the time frame of the scene you are watching, especially at the beginning.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent however and Robert Foster stands out in particular. As I just finished watching this, I looked at the news to discover he had just died. A very sad note but an amazing performance to leave us with.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone unless you are very familiar with all the characters in BB then this may confuse you. Catch up with the original series, it's worth the time to watch an amazing series once again. A solid seven for this. Eleven for the original series. Nothing happened!!!!!!! It was just Jesse trying to get out of town. CHRIST I can't believe someone financed this crap!!! I'm a massive fan of Breaking Bad, and i hold it as if not the best TV show of all time, at least top 3. Breaking Bad was one of the best written, directed, acted and produced TV shows that ever was, and the characters where amazing.<br/><br/>So when i first heard about this movie coming out, of course i was incredibly stoked to see it. And after i have now seen it, I'm left with a bit if an empty feeling inside, which never happened in the TV Show, where every single episode seem to take one unpredictable step after the other, making it almost impossible to guess what the next move was. In this movie however, this is not the case, at least not as it was with Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>It's a warm welcome to see these characters again, and many of the characters from the original show is revisiting their characters, though clearly, the young ones have grown up a bit, it clearly shows, but it's nice to see them again. But this movie unfortunately leans a bit too much on nostalgia, and it also revisits plots and key elements of the original show a bit too much to feel original on it's own.<br/><br/>What this movie really accomplishes is to finally show us the real Jesse, as we kind of never got the chance to really get to know him, since he was either high or Walther had him in a Jam. I sort of hated Jesse from the Show, thought he was weak and dumb. But after seeing this, he surely has redeemed himself, he is now his own man, making choices based off his characters beliefs and motivations.<br/><br/>I just wished this movie could stand a bit more on it's own. Come up with something entirely new, all the way through. Some scenes are dragged out way too long, and they feel heavy, but they also feel true to the original show, so it's not all bad. Actually El Camino looks and feels exactly like 2 episodes of Breaking Bad, the production design is pretty much exactly the same. But the writing is lacking that little extra here, that made Breaking Bad so special.<br/><br/>I wonder why that is, because Better Call Saul has continued the amazing writing, so why isn't this the case here? I know Vince Gilligan has had the idea for this movie for years, but it was first made now, why?<br/><br/>It feels a bit rushed, it feels a bit out of touch, leans too much on nostalgia, doesn't really give us much new and exiting things to look at. And to be fair, the ending was as predictable as you can get, but i also felt a sense of joy with the ending, i think that this was the proper sendoff for Jesse.<br/><br/>All in all, El Camino is made for the Breaking Bad fans, if you haven't seen Breaking Bad, this movie won't give you much. But as for us fans, this was a warm welcome, but that's also about it. An OK film, but not nearly as good as Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul is, so don't expect that. So boring. No major developments or plot lines. Only fanboys could have enjoyed this. What a let down. I like Breaking Bad. Unlike a lot of others I don't hail it as a masterpiece, but I think it was good for the most part.<br/><br/>But El Camino was absolutely pointless. It adds nothing to the story or the character of Jessie. Although I'm sure it added dollars to the pockets of Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul.<br/><br/>After having watched both El Camino and the other dreadful bore, Better Call Saul, I'm beginning to feel like Breaking Bad was a fluke which owed more to Bryan Cranston's acting skills rather than Gilligan's writing. What I spent 2+ hours watching could've been condensed down to 1 hour, and added more story. There were too many dragged out scenes that were 'fluff'. Directing was great, Paul was amazing, but I feel I could've written a better script. Nevertheless, a sweet closure for Jesse. 7/10 from me. It was really cold and empty, nothing of an importance really happens. Just like the episode of the fly, it was just a filler.<br/><br/>I really liked the series, specially the ending, and I'd kill form another season, but this wasn't like the series, not even close. Sorry, but I'm not buying this. What a masterpiece. An epic masterpiece that brings all of our favourites' stories to a close in a big way. The cinematography alone will bring a tear to your eye Everything in this movie is great!! The flashbacks the storyline it is a MASTERPIECE! I'll keep it short and sweet. Avoid this movie if you're a Breaking Bad fan. It's just awful.<br/><br/>The story has no focus, and no consistent character development. All the cameos serve no purpose to the story, and the movie is full of useless tracking shots and drawn out scenes that don't need to exist. This could have been done in 45 minutes tops.<br/><br/>The movie does have some good performances. That's it's one saving grace. Avoid like the plague otherwise. I actually didn't have lots of expectations or hype for El Camino, but it still disappointed me. This is a very unnecessary film that adds almost nothing to the near perfect ending of the show. Did we really need this wrap-up, six years after the finale, with clearly aged actors and a lacklustre plot? If the film was in the works, they could at the very least had made it years ago when Aaron Paul could still pass for a teenager. He is 40 years old now and unfortunately there comes a time where "One day later" plots don't work. His acting is great as always, but he's outgrown Jesse as a character.<br/><br/>Without spoiling, nothing really happened, and a strange amount of time was spent on flashbacks. The film seemed both rushed and dragging simultaneously. The story, while realistic and logical, is supremely uninteresting and left me confused as to why it was made, let alone why it was made this year. It had no emotional impact, which is a shame because there is clearly lots of talent here. My recommendation is to leave this alone and stick with the show. Personally, I never bothered to know what happened to Pinkman afterwards, but why the heck not if the movie is there? Well, I don't regret spending two hours watching; it is solid entertainment and has few well played and well thought through moments. Solid stuff. Well above our modern standards.
Yet it has one less than believable scene of duel, which I found too cheesy and too much of a blatant fan service
Another complaint is that couple of most important actors (you'll see who) got noticeably older and seriously fatter since Breaking Bad, which gave me giggles that were a bit out of place.
Let me also praise Vince Gilligan for not submitting to PC hysteria of the modern era and not adding some utterly superfluous PC characters. The movie's ok. Not great, not bad, but it takes away from the perfect ending in the TV series. I already know you're going to watch the movie, because... Breaking Bad... But maybe there's one person out there who I can convince to just let it be. Enjoy the series for its cinematic perfection and resist the urge to taint it with this less-than-Breaking-Bad addendum. Don't go into this film expecting it to be as heart wrenching, captivating and shocking as the fantastic series was.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film wasn't really needed, the ending is just as satisfying as the ending to the series, so much so that it just feels like an alternate final episode that they could of made just after the actual final episode if they wanted to. This film could of easily been done as an episode without dragging out most of the parts to each scene.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was still as brilliantly made as Breaking Bad was, Vince Gilligan's eye for detail never fails to impress, the performances were perfect as usual and it is still an enjoyable watch. The subtle hints and nods to some of the most iconic parts of the show were very much appreciated. A lot of people seem to think that telling this story was unnecessary, and that it didn't bring anything new to the table. I disagree. This is the story where Jesse stepped out of Walter White's shadow and took charge of his own destiny. At the end he is still a tormented and broken person, but at least his actions were no longer controlled by Walter (or hindered by the police and biker gangs). To get what he wanted in the end, he had to become as ruthless as Walter, but perhaps no so much that he lost his integrity. A satisfying and bittersweet ending to Jesse's story arch. The only negative thing I can say is that while the 'flashbacks' are great (yes, despite Todd's increased weight), they do drag on. I would have liked to see Jesse do more stuff after his escape and a bit less retreading of the past. Walter is dead. Jesse is on the run after escaping from the Brotherhood. He steals Todd's El Camino. This is a direct sequel to the finish of the TV show with many flashbacks. Those flashbacks are more or less fan service to bring back familiar characters. The ending is not really in doubt. Getting there has a couple of fun Breaking Bad scenes. The fridge and the vacuum are classic Breaking Bad. The style and the filmmaking is a continuation of the TV show. The story however has limited tension. While each individual turn may be unpredictable, the direction and the final target is very much. This may not be a truly necessity of the franchise. It adds very little to the story. It's not expanding the universe. It's more tying up a few loose threads which aren't begging to be tied down. The only thing about Breaking Bad in this film? The characters. Surely this film has very little to do with the style and characteristics of the show, which happened to be very different. Lights, photography and scenes are far from what Breaking Bad was. Overall a good farewell to Jesse Pinkman with some interesting performances, nothing else though. The winner was the script and the bits between the violence. You only need mayhem in the absence of great words character and acting.<br/><br/>This had all three and I really enjoyed watching them ply their trades. When the violent bits happened, they were not over done and were worth waiting for.<br/><br/>You know a good production when you want a murdering drug addicted misfit to win. Vince Gilligan done it once again.
A good end for the series. I'm split between giving this a 7 or 8 but I'll remain at 8 for now
Anyway, this movie was pretty hyped, and that's not to say I wasn't part of it. Like most I love breaking bad, it's probably my favourite show I've seen. When el Camino was announced I wasn't expecting anything extravagant, just a satisfying epilogue. It kind of reminds of toy story 4 in a way, but I'd still say I prefer this. El Camino doesn't bring anything new to the table but it also doesn't rely on nostalgia bait (for lack of a better word)
It feels just as exhilarating and exciting as breaking bad and that's probably why I like it so much, it's not just a sob story but has some genuinely funny moments. Everything is original, even though there is a lot of flashbacks, which is something I'm pretty happy about.
Aaron Paul, just like in breaking bad, does a great job her as another bonus
For fans of the show I would definitely check it out, whether you find unnecessary or not is up to you. I still feel that we shouldn't know what happens to Jessie but that doesn't detract from the positives It's a good movie. Not the best I've seen. But this is what we needed. We got to see some old characters again, see how they're doing. And we got to know how it ends with Jesse Pinkman. Like the last time we saw him in Breaking Bad, he was free, but looked pretty bad. I'm just happy to see he's doing well now. The flashbacks were nice to watch. It was just a satisfying ending I guess we all needed to see. While fat Tod is - as remarked by many reviewers - distracting, was I the only one to notice Walter's huge head due to the use of a bald-cap? Rather than an actually shaved head as during the series? Dude looked like a bobble-head doll...
Otherwise entertaining movie, nothing more, nothing less... Well just watched this not 9.8 at all 6 at best. I did love the breaking bad series
But this would have worked better as a mini series not a film
Just. No action really I'm afraid I've to say that the world was doing just okay without El Camino. BB was complete by all means and this 2 episode thing packed into one with so much hype around it wasn't just needed as much. Vince and the team missed it this time. I'll be eternally grateful to them though for creating such a masterpiece like BB. Feels like the actors forgot how to act like their characters. Walt doesn't seem like Walt, the old Jesse doesn't seem like the old Jesse. Pretty alright story line, but I don't feel that it is consistent with Breaking Bad. Why?
why tod did not get in a diet before you start filming.
he is way too fat
i don't know if there is a health issue but if there is not it is just lame Honestly this movie didn't do anything for me. I was hoping its really the continuation of breaking bad but its litteraly nothing. Its literally 2hrs to tell you Pinkman went to Alaska. They could hv done so much with this. Also, they didn't show anything about skinny when he kept the El Camino which is the title of the movie lol really disappointed and thats coming from a breaking bad fan. It is amazing movie,i really like it and it has not so much action in this movie but story has effected deepyly you again. Also, there is lots of good views , excellent shooting now . I love you breaking bad.....! Loved Breaking Bad. Did not love El Camino. It is slow. It is plodding. It is nothing like Breaking Bad. Worst of all, it is anticlimactic. Very disappointed in it. I don't know understand a high marks for this movie, it's a shame that people leave 6,7,8,9 or 10. The movie is a low level, like a C production and does not reach B. No story, without any element of a normal movie. What a shame to ruin a good series with a bad movie. I don't understand why Vince Gilligan and Netflix have participated in this movie disaster.
I do not recommend it to anyone, a loss 2 hours of my life.
Please, if you are interested in watching something normal, avoid this movie!!! 2 hours went past like 20 minutes. I finished the movie and was like no i want more. The movie was excellent. It was like the sweet little dessert to the main course that is Breaking Bad. If you have reasonable expectations and understand why Gilligan made this movie, then you really shouldn't be able to be disappointed. To all the people that were expecting a better story, that's what the point of Breaking Bad was. This is called closure it's not like they were trying to start a new story. They gave us the one piece we kinda still wanted to know "for sure"...and it was delivered just right!!! there were things that weren't explained. First of all, They didn't really elaborate on the shootout in Jacks compound in the last episode. We never found out if Gretchen and Elliot ever gave the money to Walter junior. Hank and Steve Gomez weren't mentioned not even once let alone the bodies were never found considering the fact that Walt gave skylar the coordinates to them. What happened with skylar?
Not that it's really important but the movie should've summed up the whole series and while it served its purpose as a great epilogue it just felt empty. I loved the flashback with Walt but it just wasn't enough. maybe i'm asking for too much but with an extra half hour showing these things happening or maybe even having Walt die in a hospital bed on life support would've been enough for me. Overall 7.5/10 Good movie Good purpose but not enough considering we were left with a lot of cliffhangers in the last episode. Hopefully better Call Saul will elaborate on these things when that show reaches its finale so Vince Gilligan still has the opportunity to make things right on Walt's end. El Camino is great in the sense that you reunite with the characters you loved on BB , and yes, there is closure. However, the movie was truly unnecessary. Take El Camino at face value, enjoy the ride, don't search for a deeper meaning, and let's all say goodbye to Walt and Jessie one last time. A real enjoyable extension to a perfect series. This movie really does justice to the Pinkman character, a deserved extension of the story of an honourable character.
Some of the acting and cast preparation could have been better. You just feel with a bit more preparation and respect to the former selves of particularity Todd and Badger would have made this film perfect. Such small things that could have been avoided with a bit of editing and re shoots. However this doesn't ruin the movie... Excellent! However, the structure of this movie leaves a lot to be desired. There is some good stuff here, and none of it's bad, it's just put together in a way that wasn't particularly engaging. I love Breaking Bad a ton, my favorite show by a mile, and this is a nice denouement for Jessie's story, but it's not essential viewing. Highly recommended for die-hard fans of BB, it's not a disappointment by any means, but it's not really gonna turn any heads come awards time. This movie makes The Weather Man feel like Fast and The Furious. This is by far one of the slowest movies I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>As a die hard Breaking Bad fan, the news of this upcoming movie was awesome. However, the excitement has been in vain.<br/><br/>** WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD **
This movie, is basicly Jesse Pinkmans aftermath - what happend after BB. And that's it. He gathers some money, contacts the getaway guy, and gets away. All this, in just........ 2 hours.<br/><br/>I saw Bryan Cranston on the role list, and was: Hey - some great extra side story for BB, awesome. But i was soon to be disappointed.<br/><br/>It's filled with annoying, unimportant and frankly boring "flashbacks" from Jesse's time as a slave for the nazi's (or whatever they were) and his "fun" weekend with Todd. And while we are at it: WHY DIDN'T HE JUST BLAST HIS HEAD OFF?<br/><br/>And then that drama story about some random dudes disguised as cops that wanted in on Todd's money. Seriously, WTF? This was the HIGHLIGHT of the movie, and i was so caught up in it, my boring phone was more interesting. And for some reason, he agrees to give 1/3 of the cash to a guy he saw on TV that had his friend/partner/whatever at gunpoint just minutes ago - sure that makes sense. And then Jesse's PTSD or whatever, suddenly vanishes, and he is ready for Alaska! Hurray!<br/><br/>But he need the 1.800 (out of freakin' 250.000) but "a deal is a deal" i guess. So where to go? Let's rob the dudes who freakin' gave you 1/3 of the money instead of killing you - great idea! But they are 5, and you are 1 - what do you do - how get further in the script? VINCE to the rescue - let's say that the leader of the dudes is all into western movies, and want's to do a shoot off with Jesse? That's a brilliant idea, boss! Noone will think that is wierd!<br/><br/>Vince, you did one hell of a job with BB, but this gotta be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted 2 hours on. I was furious when yesterday's newspapers were reporting that it was a boring sleepy movie. I watched it and loved it. I wasn't bored a single moment. At no time did I expect a remake of or similar-style "Breaking Bad TV-series." This show is over. BB gem was made and is in the past now. If you have Breaking Bad withdrawal syndrome, then watch that "Better Call Saul" tv-series. But better still re-watch Season 5 of BB before El-Camino.<br/><br/>I think we live in a world where young internet-born critics don't understand what they are watching. Expect a lot. Much like PC babies from South Park. Just realise that sometimes you have to watch something someone made for you, and understand what is being conveyed. Have another watch next week, different day, different time of day. Maybe your opinion will change. Your state mind will determine your enjoyment. State of mind changes every hour. Whether you agree with this or not, Breaking Bad is known as one of the greatest, if not the greatest television series' of all time by many people. Created by Vince Gilligan, it seems the series gains more and more viewers as the years go on. Although not as talked about as it was when it was on the air, it's still remembered as one of the greats and I believe it always will be. In my opinion, it truly pushes the boundaries of storytelling in the television medium. For these reasons alone, I was excited, yet slightly worried when Vince Gilligan announced that a continuation of the Breaking Bad story was being worked on. El Camino: A Breaking Bad Story is now streaming on Netflix and has put all my worries to rest. This is a great epilogue.<br/><br/>Following the events that unfolded at the conclusion of the series, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) finds himself on the run from the law. With the help of some old friends in Badger and Skinny Pete, he's able to go further under the radar. With the help of flashbacks to moments that the series never explored, side characters and elements from the show are given a little more depth. This film is truly a send-off for this character and doesn't leave too many loose ends. There are a few things I would have liked this movie to explore, but what is given to the audience will most likely satisfy the majority.<br/><br/>The tone of this movie is much more laid back than the series itself. While the look and feel of the original series is still very much present, it also feels like it has a life of its own, which I really appreciated. Viewers who haven't seen the show can easily watch this movie as a film about a man on the run, trying to escape his past, but it will ultimately only be loved by those who will get the full experience from it. There are more than a couple of heightened scenes sprinkled throughout, but this movie is an epilogue first and foremost, which is meant to wrap things up in a quieter manner.<br/><br/>Some viewers will surely miss the absence of Walter White, played superbly in the series by Bryan Cranston, but I'll say there are more than enough nostalgic surprises to fill that void. Aaron Paul was always great as a Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad, but this time around, his character has truly evolved and I'm not sure if I've ever seen him better. He knew this was probably the final thing fans would ever see from these core characters of the show (Better Call Saul aside) and it really shows in his performance here. Award-worthy once again.<br/><br/>In the end, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is absolutely more than satisfy most fans of the series and provide them with closure in ways they didn't know they actually wanted to see. Vince Gilligan truly cares about the characters in this over-arching story and his screenplay here feels like a casual continuation of the original premise. It doesn't take as many risks as the series did, but this particular story didn't have to. The camerawork and editing style is very reminiscent to that of the series, but when you bring back the entire main crew from the series, you should come to expect that. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad, I absolutely recommend checking out El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Not that it wasn't good, but the entire series was so good that this just seemed like an episode. Unfortunately there won't be another one next week. It'd be solid as an episode of mini series with at least 5 episodes of Jesse life on the run, after BB.
But as a movie, nothing happened, literally nothing we didn't know or couldn't predict. It's like we only watched trailer.<br/><br/>I'd give it lower rate if it's not Breaking Bad sequel and Jesse is my favorite next to Hank.<br/><br/>Why, o why, Vince Gilligan, haven't you made a mini series out of this!?! This movie was about all Jessie how got his revenge and inner peace but it's very slow with a lot of useless parts which we really didn't wanna see. I wish it was more brutal like breaking bad but it was not. Breaking bad is one of the best series I have ever watched ... but I have no idea why they made this movie ... it's completely senseless.. they just used the name to get viewers to watch this movie .. this just my point of view When I watched the last episode of Breaking Bad roughly two years ago, I felt a huge amount of emptiness. First, because I finished one of the greatest TV shows of all time and I felt like I lost something at that moment that was very dear to my heart. It was hard to let it go.<br/><br/>Second, because I felt that Jesse's storyline was left unresolved and unfinished. As much as I loved the Breaking Bad finale - after all, it was cathartic, satisfying, and deeply impactful on an emotional level - in the past two years I kept wondering what happened to Jesse after his escape. I always felt that this story would be well worth telling.<br/><br/>It looks like this lingering question was in Vince Gilligan's head too the whole time since he finishied his (near) masterpiece of a series, but he only decided to answer it 6 years after the show's original run has ended. Now, after finishing El Camino, there's one question I asked from myself. Is this story really needed to be told, and if so, was this the right way to tell it?<br/><br/>Because the thing is, I thought that after I'll watch this movie, I'll get a real closure, I'll have a fullfilling, meaningful, and deep cinematic experience, I'll get a definitive end to a character's life and to a brilliant series. I thought that if we get a 2 hour continuation to Breaking Bad in the form of a movie after all these years, there's has to be a strong reason for that.<br/><br/>I thought that I'll see something in the veins of Drive (to give you an example) - a movie with a high level of tension and suspense, an artistic piece of cinematic work about a person with a troubled life who is seeking for personal redemption and ultimately, is looking for an escape from his past.<br/><br/>I expected a lot of things but I have not expected the feeling of emptiness to hit me for the third time after finishing the movie. But this is exactly what I've got. El Camino felt like a mostly pointless and lukewarm epilogue to a brilliant series, instead of something that would have elevated its brilliance to even greater heights.<br/><br/>It was a two-hour feature film, yet it felt like there's so little happened in it. It was a movie that was almost completely devoid of any real tension. It was a movie basically about nothing. The whole script can be summed up in one sentence. Basically, Jesse went to some places to grab some money and then he travelled to Alaska. Literally, that's it.<br/><br/>There are so many ways this story could have been told and/or expanded, there are so many interesting plotlines that could have been explored. Or at the very least, we could have gotten a razorsharp, tightly focused suspense thriller/drama/action movie with minimal dialog and with a high focus on building tension and atmoshpere. Kinda like a crossover between Breaking Bad and Vanishing Point (or think about any great escape movie).<br/><br/>However, what we've got instead is a movie with a lot of unnecessary padding and filler. We've got a lot of scenes that while are often good and quite tasteful, they don't really move the story forward in any meaningful way and they don't really deepen the characters any further than we've already seen them on the show. They are just there to extend the run time of the movie, in order to justify it to be a movie in the first place.<br/><br/>Expectations can be harmful, however, I'm not actually disappointed because the movie didn't went the way I thought it would. I'm disappointed because I expected a meaningful and memorable movie that will be a worthy continuation and closure to Breaking Bad. But what I've got instead is something that while good enough, at the same time, nearly pointless, and again, it left me with a huge amount of emptiness. I saw "El Camino" as soon as it came out on Netflix. Being a hardcore "Breaking Bad" fan I knew I would love it. It turns out that I thought it was just "OK", with the pacing considerably slower than ANY of the last 8 episodes of BB. "El Camino" has the pacing of an average "Better Call Saul" episode, which is typically slower than "Breaking Bad". That's not a bad thing at all, but being this a feature film I was expecting more. Or so I thought right after watching it.<br/><br/>I've just recently binged on "Breaking Bad" all over again and must confess that I enjoyed it even more than the 1st time around and a second watching of "El Camino" was due. While my original score did not change, I appreciated it WAY more this time. Rewatching BB obviously helped. Minor details, characters you might've forgotten pop up again and the movie flows better. A reason for this I think is the fact that "El Camino" kicks off right after the events of "Breaking Bad's" adrenaline fueled finale. Aaron Paul is back again as the broken Jesse Pinkman, slightly chubbier and with more beard this time around. In extended flashback scenes we see Jesse's captor, Todd (Jesse Plemons) that visibly gained way more weight than Aaron Paul, so most of his scenes are shot from afar to disguise the fact. Badger and Skinny Pete also show up.<br/><br/>While I obviously talk for myself, if you thought "El Camino" was a bit lackluster, try giving BB a rerun and put this film right after and your concept will definitely change to a positive one.<br/><br/>An epilogue for Walter White's/Jesse Pinkman's story could not have been more suitable. I'm sure other fans might've wanted to know what happened to Walt's family; what happened to Skyler, Holly and Walter Jr. Did she face trial? What happened to Marie? Out of all the possible epilogue scenarios, Pinkman's fate seemed the most reasonable one. For Saul Goodman's ending, we'll have to wait how that series ties everything up.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: I enjoyed "El Camino" much more after rewatching the entire Breaking Bad series. If you have the time to do that during this pandemic, give it a try! Well made good acting breaking bad movie jesse pinkman shooting guns money cops etc El Camino is the farewell to Jesse Pinkman.
It isn't as good as Breaking Bad, but that's just not possible.
So you shouldn't expect from the film to be better than the series.<br/><br/>It is a good film with an ending that Jesse deserved. I'm always cautious when they do things like this. Sometimes series are best left alone when they conclude. I didn't really know what to expect. I thought Jesse's ending was satisfying in the original show. He's free and it's left to the viewer to wonder what his life will be like. So I was a little reluctant to watch it. And I'm glad I did as I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I don't get the complaints that this film was slow. I thought it was well paced and built up nicely. Breaking Bad was never a thriller and had slow build ups to things.<br/><br/>It fits in really well with the series. It's hard to judge it as a film on it's own but I do think I would still enjoy it even if I hadn't watched Breaking Bad, although obviously to understand it completely you need to. So following on from my catch up of watching the Breaking Bad boxset. I thought I'd conclude it with the follow on movie. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, then you may not get the concept and story-line. So maybe do that first. If you haven't seen it then what I say below may ruin your experience.
So this is a movie that continues the story of Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul) after the last scenes of Breaking Bad. Jesse is escaping form where he had been held hostage, we see him racing from the scene in a Chevrolet "El Camino". Jesse soon notices red and blue flashing light lighting up the night sky. He pulls over to allow the Police cars to pass without him being seen (they are heading to the place where Breaking Bad had its ending). Jesse soon realises that he is at the forefront of a mass manhunt. He needs to do something? Does he leave town?
So the movie goes through his exploits and we see essential flashbacks to parts within the Breaking Bad Series, where we see cameos from Mike, Walt, Todd and a few more. While at this point i want to just state that one thing that i didn't like in the movie was, small attention to detail. Now, this maybe because i have very recently watched the series, but i noticed that Todd (played by Jesse Plemons) had gained a bit of weight. He is appearing in flashbacks, these would be during the final season, and he looks bigger. I know, small detail, but with the precision that Vince Gilligan (Director & Co Writer) had gone to all the way through the boxset, i just thought it was a bit careless and unBreaking Badlike. That said, i did enjoy the way the movie panned out and the action was good, and i think that most Breaking Bad fans will see this as a decent lid on the whole world that this has been playing out over the 5 Seasons of the boxset. While it feels more like an extended Breaking Bad episode than a standalone movie, El Camino is a satisfying conclusion to one of the best TV characters in recent years. Purely for "Breaking Bad" fans, "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" continues the action immediately after the series finale. Jesse Pinkman's is on the run; Walter "Heisenberg" White's death has captivated the media, and so has the Nationwide manhunt for his partner.<br/><br/>There really was no need for an epilogue to Gilligan's fantastic TV series, but nonetheless "El Camino" hits all the right keys and essentially feels like another episode of the show. I say in my summary that it is a satisfying conclusion to Pinkman's tale, but I do wonder if it is perhaps just another chapter, and we will be seeing him again. Either way I would not complain. I have been a huge fan of breaking bad for many years. I've watched the series at least three times in it's entirety and have a breaking bad tattoo. I, like anyone else, was so excited to see that they were finishing Jesse's story with a movie and couldn't wait to see it.<br/><br/>It was so enjoyable to go back to Vince Gilligan's directing style, and enjoy what felt like a long episode of breaking bad. I forgot how much this show meant to me and how heavily it tugs at my heartstrings. I laughed and cried, and stayed at the edge of my seat for most of the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, I can't help but feel like it was entirely unnecessary and a bit of fan bait. One of the things I really admired about breaking bad was that the end was ambiguous. You were meant to know that Heisenberg got what he deserved, and Pinkman was free. The rest was up to your interpretation. The fact that they made a spin-off and then a movie makes me worry that they don't know when to stop.<br/><br/>As much as I love the series, I feel that adding multiple spin-offs and movies years after the series wrapped is a bit degrading to the show as a whole. It's reminiscent of the way JK Rowling sold out and continues to change her series years after it's been over to appease her fans. I feel they should not ruin a good show by continually adding to it until the fans are tired of it. Mark my words, this is not the end of the series. And you bet your ass I will still watch whatever else they put out, hating myself for loving it because I'm part of the problem. Being about an adored movie-persona in the BB world, this movie was set to succeed and so it did. I enjoyed the closure it got and to remember some of the most emblematic characters. Seeing Walt was the cherry on top of the cake. Overall not my favourite movie but it deserves recognition as a good movie. After series finale, what happened with Jesse was unanswered. The movie is ending story of jesse. I don't think we needed this movie, still I was excited to watch it when the news came out. After watching it, I can say that it came out too late. It should have come out in 2014. It's me saying who finished the show some months back, imagine the people who last saw it in 2013. Still the movie is nowhere near as bad.<br/><br/>The pacing is like a Breaking Bad episode with long drawn-out flashbacks and the film drags because of it, unlike BB episodes. Also not much new happens in the movie. The story could have been crammed into a short film of 20-30 minutes. The saving grace of the movie is Aaron Paul and the cinematography. The acting by Aaron Paul is straight from his golden days. The film looks beautiful, the shots are colorfull, still, and reflective. The technical work is great, it's just the narrative that falls short. When TV show "Breaking Bad" ended, we saw one of main characters 'Jesse Pinkman' (Aaron Paul) finally getting free thanks to 'Walter White' (Bryan Cranston) and driving away in an El Camino. That was enough to let us imagine what could come next, meaning we didn't necessarily need a movie sequel to fill in those gaps. Ultimately, the "Breaking bad" sequel film is unnecessary. If you liked the show this is the must watch, otherwise skip it - it will not be much entertaining for you, as it will leave you a tad disappointed as you would have expected a bit more from it. For me, the film feels like a cash grab, and I can see next chapter of Pinkman's life being released, maybe in next 6 years, this time in Alaska.<br/><br/>Rating: 6 I am a die hard fan of Breaking Bad however, I can assure you that at no point in time since the final episode did I ever think "I wonder what happened to Jesse Pinkman after he drove off in that car?"<br/><br/>For me, the essence of breaking Bad was the evolution of Walter White and that means Bryan Cranston. The second necessary for me in the BB environment is Gus Fring... my gooodness, Giancarlo Giuseppe Alessandro Esposito also acted his life off. Aaron Paul? He was my least favourite character and actor on the show. He can undoubtedly act, but he is a single note actor in that when I watch him in other shows he seems as though he's playing the same character whereas Giancarlo Esposito and Bryan Cranston are chameleons who disappear into any character they portray.<br/><br/>Obviously those characters could not be in this movie, but in my opinion Aaron Paul is not strong enough to carry a two hour movie on his own. The cute little cutaways to show us flashbacks with other characters were wonderful but the whole thing made me miss the real series because this apertif did not do the series justice.<br/><br/>This was a decent movie but I didn't care what happened to Jesse when BB ended and I don't care now. This movie seemed self indulgent on Vince Gilligan's part as well as Aaron Paul as Paul was a producer. My hope is that any subsequent movies include a pre-BB storyline so that we can see the star of the show. Although it was nice to be engrossed in the Breaking Bad atmosphere once again I wouldn't say that I am impressed but enjoyed it anyway. Certainly doesn't feel particularly necessary to the overall breaking bad storyline, that being said, the flowing cinematography, brilliant performances and melancholic atmosphere make for a beautiful final chapter that will satisfy any fan of the show. Though it probably would have worked better as a couple extra episodes released a few months after the shows finally back in 2014 then an actual movie. Not a bad movie, but not a great movie absolutely needed. Story isn't that interesting. Jesse Plemons' weight makes it a bit hard for immersion, as it's supposed to be exactly when Breaking Bad ended, and he clearly looks way different.
The only time I really felt like I was watching some Breaking Bad was in the flashback with Walt. Slow pace killed all the fun...<br/><br/>I guess the movie should be faster paced than the series ...<br/><br/>It became difficult to stick to the movie at the snail pace the movie plot went ahead ... This movie was pretty obviously made by someone much more comfortable with the storytelling mechanics of serialized television than a feature film. It's essentially broken into three parts (one might call them acts, but they'd be a bit incorrect) that feel like individual episodes of a three part television event made almost a decade after the original television show aired.<br/><br/>Jesse Pinkman has escaped his captivity of making crystal meth for skinheads by the gracious hand of all around hero Walter White, but he's a penniless guy who's been removed from society for months and is wanted by the police. Not wanting to be captured by the police, but to live his life free, Jesse runs to his friends Badger and Skinny Pete who give him a grounding from which to operate.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is Jesse re-entering the world and finding his feet while dealing with the most immediate results of his trauma. He has trouble with enclosed spaces and showers because of memories of his prison, but those memories provide a clue as to where Jesse could find some seed money. After Badger and Skinny Pete give Jesse a head start by taking his tracked car in a different direction, Jesse is free to operate incognito in Albuquerque, setting up the second part.<br/><br/>That section largely takes place in Todd's apartment. Todd was one of the lower level skinheads who was directed with taking charge of Jesse's health and work output. One afternoon, Todd took Jesse from his prison in the desert to Todd's apartment where he had Jesse help him with the disposal of his maid's body. He had killed her after she had accidentally found his stash of cash hidden in some encyclopedias. Todd also dropped a hint that the cash was going to move, but stay in the apartment. With Todd dead and Jesse free and in possession of Todd's keys, Jesse heads to Todd's apartment and begins a search. Just as he finds the cash, two guys in Police jackets show up, forcing a wonderfully tense extended sequence that ends with Jesse splitting the hidden cash three ways.<br/><br/>The third section brings back Robert Forster's mysterious vacuum cleaner character who runs a business that gets those who want to run away far from Albuquerque. Jesse goes to him, $1,800 short of the list price for Forster's services, and Jesse needs to find some extra money. He finds the fake police officers he had split the money with, gets into a shooting match with one of them and takes a second third of the cash (in another wonderfully tense scene). With the cash in hand, Forster takes Jesse to Alaska with a new identity and a chance for a new life.<br/><br/>I think it's easy to see the issues here. The movie's not bad, but it's not really a movie. The conflict that Jesse is in is largely internal (which is fine). He's struggling to cast off the beaten dog he had become in order to reclaim some sense of who he was. He wants to be able to function in society again, even if that society is thousands of miles away from his old life. The problem is that his journey is less important in the long sequences that dominate the film than the search for money, the plot stuff, so to speak. It's the sort of storytelling you would expect from a television series, where the plot of the individual episode is what dominates that episode, but across a season you see the growth of the characters as an accumulation of small moments over a dozen or so hours. That doesn't work quite as well in the concentrated storytelling medium that is a two hour feature film.<br/><br/>And still, there are some wonderful moments here. Jesse's search of Todd's apartment and the confrontation with the two fake police officers is marvelously tense. Jesse's interactions with Robert Forster's vacuum cleaner repairman are wonderful. Badger and Skinny Pete being as gentle and caring as their characters can be towards their friend and hero Jesse Pinkman in his moment of greatest need is quite touching. The problem is structural. The movie overcomes it to a certain degree, but not quite enough.<br/><br/>I read someone else calling El Camino an epilogue to Breaking Bad and I think that's the best way to put it. Epilogues don't generally have huge story arcs. They're small in nature, and El Camino is small. It's easy to see how they were able to film this pretty much in complete secret. The cast is very small (distractingly so at some times, especially around the skinheads), and the action almost exclusively happens in small sets like Todd's apartment that dominates the middle third of the film. Watched as the final three episodes of Breaking Bad probably makes it flow a bit better, viewing it as the last three episodes of a television series, rather than as a stand alone movie. Not much to say here. If you're a fan of Breaking Bad, watch it! You'll identify Vince Gilligan's style from the series and feel like you're watching a couple of episodes you missed. El Camino is clearly inferior to 5 seasons of epicness but it has quality and is enjoyable nonetheless. Jesse rode off into the night at the end of Breaking Bad, and I assumed he disappeared. This movie pretty much ends the same way it started (with Jesse driving off in the day instead, and as I imagined, disappearing). It was a bit slow-paced, but I really enjoyed seeing the return of so many characters and some of the aftermath of the shootout in "Felina". More for the real Breaking Bad fans. It's decent enough, just seems a little long at two hours.<br/><br/>Being six years since the season finale, much of the details from show were a little foggy to remember.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's voice I now associate with Bojack Horseman's character, Todd Chavez, which a little distracting at times. It was great to be back in Breaking Bad territory and with <a href="/title/tt9243946/">El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)</a>, it's clear Gilligan hasn't lost his touch 6 years after the final episode aired. Taking place literally seconds after the show's finale, El Camino's got everything we loved about the show (Great drama, hilarious black humour, POV shots, edge-of-the-seat suspense) and is a story with larger ideas at hand addressing the themes of trauma, regret, love and friendship. Paul is fantastic and gives the performance of a lifetime; an Oscar-calibre turn without a doubt. And with several great cameos I won't mention here, we get the cherry on top; weaving the past and the present beautifully, El Camino is the breaking bad film we didn't know we wanted but are sure happy that we got. Thank you Vince for this fitting conclusion <3 What I liked about this movie was I didn't feel this was a movie, but a very long episode of Breaking Bad Finale. A perfect ending to Jesse's character, what it would have been from the very beginning,l. And at the right moment, when you wanted to see Hisenberg, you get it!!! I liked the closure. Well done. I jumped on the Breaking Bad bandwagon pretty late, considering I binged the entire series within a month of the show's finale. With that said, I always found the ending to be completely satisfying and not necessarily begging for a sequel mini-series or a follow-up movie. El Camino, while pretty dang good, is a largely unnecessary addition to the world of Breaking Bad and almost inconsequential. It provides a nice coda for Jesse Pinkman's arc but in no way did it need to get made. Aaron Paul is fantastic, as is the late-great Robert Forster, and you can tell this certain captures the same aesthetic and tone as the show. Again, I'm not sure I will ever revisit it though.<br/><br/>8.0/10 This was not exactly a movie. BUT...it was a great last episode of Breaking Bad, had more solid scenes than most movies, and absolutely delighted me as a viewer. So why would I criticize? I want Vince Gilligan to keep. It. Going. I thought this movie was great, solely because of the tie to the breaking bad roots (which is even in the name). So it's not spectacular like something completely new but it maintains the consistency that the fundamental franchise had , so doesn't damage in any way or impact what the tv series left. It adds a sense of closure on what happened so I would definitely recommend to any breaking bad fan giving this is a watch. I was so fortunate to be a late bloomers to the series, so recently I watched series 1-5 finishing just in time for El Camino where everything is fresh in my mind. A traditionally good execution of further un touched story. Even though Breaking Bad finished around six years ago, it still rates in my mind as the best TV show ever. It is perfect from start to finish, from the story, to the character development, to the cinematography, to the key moments of triumph, pain, and "holy crap I can't believe they did that".<br/><br/>That perfection led me to trepidation upon hearing that there was going to be a Breaking Bad movie. Too often Hollywood has done follow ups, reboots, and remakes that are empty and lifeless, and just come across as them playing on audience nostalgia to make a quick buck. Would the new Breaking Bad movie be the same, or would it be crafted with the same care as the TV series?<br/><br/>The teaser trailer allayed some of those fears and then the full trailer made me think that this might just be alright.<br/><br/>AND. IT. WAS.<br/><br/>El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie just got added to Netflix, and if you're a fan of the TV show, then I highly recommend that you watch it. This is one for fans - if you haven't watched the show then very little of this will makes sense. And don't worry if you've forgotten the details of the show there is a three minute recap up front that hits all the main points to set you up for what follows.<br/><br/>What follows picks up moments after the end of the TV series, and carries on with the same careful tone and well thought out development as the TV show. Aaron Paul is outstanding in it, and to see him change his entire acting style depending on whether we are in the present or a flash back was a sight to behold. In the flashbacks he really captured the young and enthusiastic misfit nature of the young Jesse Pinkman and is the stand out of the movie. All the acting is on point, with the scenes with Badger and Skinny Pete a standout.<br/><br/>What I thought was really clever about this is that while its a movie, it plays out like an extended TV episode. It lingers on certain moments longer that you would expect in a movie, and there is no movie-like three act format. And even with those lingering moments it doesn't drag, in fact it covers a lot of ground, while keeping the story moving along towards its conclusion.<br/><br/>So, in summary, if you loved the TV series, this a fitting follow up that brings with it all the stuff you loved, matches its tone and style, and is a perfect companion piece. I like so many others consider Breaking Bad one of the best, if not the best, show of all time. I came in with low expectations and got what expected. There were a few continuity errors and they could have done so much more with the story then taking 2 hours to tell you that Jesse went to Alaska. Like following up on Skyler, Walter Jr, Holly and Marie in the wake of Walt and Hank's deaths. We all know that Marie is going to blame Skyler for Hank's murder, and that shift in dynamic would have been interesting to see. Overall it wasn't bad, but I'm still a bit disappointed. This movie picks up after the events at the end of breaking bad. Jesse has just escaped and has police looking for him.
Whilst on this new journey of Jesse pinkmans we meet some familiar faces like skinny Pete and badger. The both of them in this doing some amazing acting for the short time they are in the movie.
Overall I think this movie makes for a very good time with a lot of suspence and tension in some scenes. I also found this movie extremely emotional after following Jesse pinkmans journey this far and seeing all he's been through has led him to a truly broken man. The writing is also very good by vince gilligan once again but I found the ending was rather predictable. I never found this a very bad ending though. Loved the part of Jessie Pinkman. I'm just wondering why he didn't get a full spinoff series. It would of rated a 10 had it been a full fledged series. This felt kind of like a pilot. Yet a bit to long for a pilot and too short for a film. But it had all of the noir Breaking Bad had or least showed promise of having it. I hope it's not the last we see of Jessie and his (delightful) flashbacks. They could provide material for several episodes and seasons. In fact a remake of Breaking Bad in its entirety minus Walt's wife and their endless pillow talk drudgery and I would definitely award it a 10. Good movie but..<br/><br/>I love BB and BCS but this movie.. idk it don't have the same feeling with the series and the story is not challenging at all. Beside the story everything is welldone.<br/><br/>Too late..<br/><br/>It would be fine if this movie released one year after BB finale but after 5-6 years of course people expect more than this. I personally loved the movie my girlfriend didn't but being a die hard fan of the series I probably took more from it , such as the the spider that Todd had kept all that time since killing the original owner (the boy on the bike) .
Also the method in which jesses kills Todd because it's the same method that Todd used on his cleaning lady .
There is a few plot holes but can't complain just annoyed that Walter white is now officially dead.
Was hoping for a reunion.
Leave it alone now I'm done. I loved every second of El Camino. Before watching this movie keep in mind it's not gonna beat the serie in any aspect. Though it is an awesome extension of it. Vince did a great job writing the the script of how Jesse's story continues after the great final of breaking bad. When I had finished watching Breaking Bad, my feeling was: no one won.
Although, I understood the message of the whole show was how destructive drugs are and that you never do win with drugs, however, it always felt like something was missing. It needed closure for Jesse.
This was it. This tied it up perfectly.
It took way too long for it come out, as the years pass, Breaking Bad's status as one of the greatest TV Shows of all time hardens, people expected too much from this.
This was the satisfying end that I needed for Jesse. The final scenes were so sad but I genuinely felt happy for a fictional character getting closure.
It did lack a little bit of drama and there were some unnecessary scenes.
But it was the perfect send off. Without spoiling the movie for everyone i feel like this movie lost the character of Jessie and show's a more serious guy.
Jessie is my favorite character in the movie/tv world and in this movie the character lacks all the "yeah science!" type of things.
But in all a good movie and worth watching for all Breaking Bad fans out there. Fat Todd definitely stops you getting into the BB world and his role is way extensive, so the entire movie feels more like happening on a tangent time line. The movie itself has no sharp corners so don't expect any h..ly sh..t moments. Even Skinny and Badger don't feel like familiar. I like to think BB ended with Felina and this is more like a side project with a little nostalgia. El Camino picks up immediately from the end of Breaking Bad. Jesse, after having been enslaved and tortured for six months by a group of Neo Nazis, is finally free. But there's a few more hurdles he has to get over before he can be truly free of Walt and everything that's happened. He needs the help of Ed, the Vacuum Cleaner guy, to make him disappear, but for that he needs money. Fortunately he knows exactly where to get a heap of money, but it's not as easy as it first appears. Interlaced into this simple story are a series of flashbacks with recognisable faces from the series. The biggest flashback involves a weekend away helping Todd get rid of a dead body sometime during those six months locked up. Mike, Jane, and of course Walt all make small appearances as well.<br/><br/>My biggest problem for this movie is that once the credits rolled, I didn't really see the point in its existence. The show ended with Jesse driving off into the sunset (or sunrise, technically) free of the burden of Walt once and for all. Sure he wasn't home-free, but he was out of it at last. Of course he needed to disappear, of course he needed to find a large sum of money from somewhere, of course he needed to evade the police. El Camino does not change that ending at all. It just shows us what was already assumed by Breaking Bad's ending. It felt like spoonfeeding us something we kind of already knew. There's no surprises here at all.<br/><br/>The only reason I can think of why El Camino exists is as an epilogue to the show, and it works perfectly fine as that. In truth I feel this is the only way you can watch El Camino, as it doesn't stand very well as a movie by itself. I don't feel it needed to be a whole movie, nor did it need all the flashbacks, to serve this purpose though. The appearances of dead characters in the flashbacks felt like fan-service and largely served no purpose, other than for them to remind Jesse how young he still is, and as such how lucky he is to still have his whole life ahead of him. The exception being the Todd flashbacks which explained how Jesse knew where to look for a large sum of money. But then again these flashbacks were kind of ruined by Jesse Plemons' substantial weight gain in the last six years. He didn't even look like Todd any more. Of course everyone looks older (which is also something that can be leveled at Better Call Saul), but no-one has gone through as dramatic a transformation as Jesse Plemons.<br/><br/>With all that said, like any other Breaking Bad fan, it was just nice to be back in this universe, see the fallout of Walt's attack on the Neo Nazis, see some fan-favourite characters reappear, and finally get complete and utter closure to Jesse's story, especially considering how relatively short-changed he was in the show's final moments. And it still feels like Breaking Bad. It's been six years, but everyone slips back in like it was another episode. We actually watched the last two episodes first to make sure we remembered exactly how it went down, and it fit on the end so naturally.<br/><br/>And that's why I don't feel like I should be reviewing El Camino. It just feels like one last episode of Breaking Bad. I've already had to spoil key points of the show just to be able to talk about this movie. It doesn't stand on its own at all, which is both a blessing and a curse depending on how you were expecting to approach it. As an epilogue it's fantastic, but as a movie it felt like it lacked purpose; a reason for existing. There's still great moments of tension, exquisite character work, and top-notch cinematography, but it makes no sense without the previous five seasons of Jesse's character development, nor does it provide anything new to the wider story or characters. I give El Camino an enjoyable but unnecessary 7/10. Movie was simple, entertaining and seemed like an additional episode to tell us what happened to Jesse. But until there... It was obviously done for money, there was not enormous drama or emotion scenes with Mr White from the past and nothing socking at all. It was unnecessary and its numbers are expected but only out of curiosity. Jesse was good at his role. Just let this good series in peace. This should have been made and shown back in Sept 2013 as the last episode. It was funny seeing how fat the character Todd got in the last 6 years. I guess he is no longer an actor. In Breaking Bad we had probably the greatest ever TV drama. Accepted that it may have outlived its original premise. The final series with the nazis didn't do it for me, it is too painful to watch at times and felt very contrived. The degradation of Jesse Pinkman is so painful and this continues into El Camino, via flashbacks.<br/><br/>That said it is a fitting epitaph to a wonderful series. It's not on a par with any of the Breaking Bad episodes but it is good and it's great to have Jesse, Badger and Skinny P back.<br/><br/>Ps the best episode for me was when Gustav Fring was blown up by a vengeful Hector. That would have been fitting end for me. It's good. I Had fun, had a pleasant time. I liked to see the old characters again.<br/><br/>But did we really need a movie like this? I don't know, man. By the end of the show, Jesse had an open end. We didn't know what had happened to him. After watching this movie, we found out what happened to him during that time. In the end of this movie, we came across an open ending again and we don't know what happened to him again. I am just asking, was this story really needed to be told? Yeah, story was not bad. We saw old characters again. And like I said I was happy to seeing them again. But I felt empty after watching the movie.<br/><br/>They showed us Pete and Badger in the movie but we don't know what happened to them. Why did they disappear after appearing at the beginning of the movie? And also Todd, you need to lose weight, man. I love Aaron Paul but in the flashback scenes he was bad. I don't think he is playing young Jesse well. I didn't see young Jesse cheerful and excited like I see in Breaking Bad in this movie. I think we're all really getting older like Aaron Paul. :) And also where's the prison scene we saw in the trailer? You know, Pete is talking with the cops. I was excited about that scene. Reading through the reviews on IMDB can be a minefield. 1 star reviews, 10 star reviews and very little in-between. These reviews and ratings are submitted by Breaking Bad fans who feel they need to even up the overall score a little because they either hated the film or loved it... My advice IGNORE THESE REVIEWS!!<br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!!! No Seriously if you do not want to know certain plot points do not continue reading!!<br/><br/>Let me start by stating I am an enormous advocate of breaking bad it is the only TV series I have ever invested in (apart from maybe The Wire) that had a proper well written ending that was satisfying and truly put a lump in my throat (no need to reference Game of Thrones finale here! Or even Lost both terrible let downs from a viewer's point of view). I have binged watched it over and over.<br/><br/>So, imagine my delight when I stumble upon the El Camino teaser trailer featuring Skinny Pete basically refusing to give Jesse up (not in the actual film BTW, genius idea!)<br/><br/>Next Imagine my apprehension that this was going to be another Netflix 'Cash-Grab' to force money out of unsuspecting BB fans and ruin a true Breaking Bad legacy forever (again see Game of Thrones). Roll on Friday 11th October...<br/><br/>Then after watching El Camino, imagine my relief and then sudden feeling of satisfaction & joy when El Camino turned out to be an excellent film fully deserving of its current 9\10 rating on IMDB (as I am about to submit this review the score has sunk to 8.1\10 SHAME ON YOU IMDB USERS, SHAME!!)<br/><br/>The flashbacks are written beautifully (you need to suspend disbelief a little because obviously the reprised cast have all aged and, in some cases, put on a little baggage (cough!! Todd cough! Sorry Jesse Plemons)).<br/><br/>The writing is superb all the acting also superb especially from Aaron Paul the cinematography is second to none with some very well directed camera shots.
The film has a real sense of suspense at a nice even pace which drew me in slowly punctuated by the flashback scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes have a real dark comedy e.g. when the Nazi guys are forcing Jesse to try and break the rail device, he is tethered to because they are quibbling about the workmanship of the welder... this detracted from Jesse's forced slavery a little.<br/><br/>!!HERE ARE THOSE SPOILERS I WARNED YOU ABOUT!!<br/><br/>It would have been nice to have seen Walt Junior (Flynn) and Skyler in some of the flashbacks or part of the main storyline to maybe close off their story a little but, hey we can't have everything right?<br/><br/>The ending is predictable but closes off the story clean and simple, and I am so glad that Vince didn't settle for a ...crime doesn't pay ending with Jesse either ending up in prison or being killed off (unless living in Alaska is like prison?)<br/><br/>All in all, I am thankful to Vince Gilligan for not letting me down and also thankful that Netflix have something to offer that isn't abysmal, which let's face it sums up most of their new content these days and forces me to cancel my subscription constantly. Regarding El Camino - well worth this month's subscription! Sigh! Thanks Netflix. Breaking Bad was good because was different kind of show, things seems to be more real with the series. The big finally that "El Camino" provide is something like the happy end of tragic story. We all happy for Jessy. The movie is not the best entertainment out there, but is down to earth normal and realistic, like how it could happen in the real life. This movie isn't an abomination, but it certainly isn't good. The whole film is slow and the payoff is underwhelming. I feel like the BB ending is better if you don't watch this, the cliffhanger is what kept people taking about the series and now it's gone. The story of Jesse Pinkman after he escapes from the meth lab/welding plant, takes revenge, and finds redemption.<br/><br/>I'd expect that writer/director Vince Gilligan would want El Camino to stand alone, without reference to the seminal series that it is the last word on. And it does stand alone as a movie, just not as a blockbuster. For some reason I kept thinking of Spielberg's 'Duel', which is similar in that it's a small-scale, small-cast, one-track suspense story - and not a bad film.<br/><br/>In Breaking Bad there were many story threads to keep track of; in EC there's just one, unless you count the questions of how Todd has put on 40 pounds, and Jesse, despite being in a concrete hole for months, has filled out a bit. And in fact, that's the only humor in this movie, which doesn't spoil it, but surely accounts for its two-dimensionality. Ex-BB producer/writer Peter Gould's taken the humor in BB spinoff Better Call Saul to much higher levels.<br/><br/>Very much what it is: the worthy epilog to a magnificent TV show. Don't let the fact that you miss Breaking Bad make you forget that Vince Gilligan has kept faith with the fans.<br/><br/>PS Is it me - and this is just an observation - or is EC somewhat Latino-lite? It is a perfect breaking bad movie.
And perfect ending for beloved character jesse.
But at some points this movie is not touching my expectations, but it is very good. breaking bad is a masterpiece,no one can beat it, not even a breaking bad movie.
The first half of the movie is great,we can see how jesse manages everything & how broken he is because of nazis.
There is no action in the first half of the movie only you can find is jesse trying to get away with it. At some point the first half become slightly slow.
In the second half there is a little bit of action.
The flashbacks are amazing. Every flashback is amazing, it fits every time. Not a single time i felt that this flashback is unnecessarily added.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead;)<br/><br/>When the flashback of walt came up on screen i bacame high dude. Seeing walt and Jesse after all of this years is my dream.
My suggestion: i want and they could add some more action scenes in the movie but how jesse is treated by nazis and how broker he is by all of this events, i think vince want to keep the story dark & clean.
Also some more meth related talk or flashbacks are required in the movie,because we all want that, because it is one of the main part of breaking bad & it is a breaking bad movie.<br/><br/>At 2-3 point this movie is taking my attention
First is fat todd mannn... What is this?
That guy doesn't fit in the El Camino at all.
all the todd scenes are nice but we can't imagine fat todd in breaking bad world, you already shown us the normal todd so,why?
And also they can use cgi for this problem.<br/><br/>And second is,
When the movie starts the beard of the jesse is so much grown as compared to felina. Although it was unnoticeable part i think.<br/><br/>When jesse is in the todd's apartment, that scene is too much longer,we know he is looking for money you don't need to show us every goddamn part where he is searching for it.
Apart from all this is the great movie with great direction, Aaron paul is completely in his character like jesse is still alive in his body.
All other breaking bad characters' acting is also best.
All breaking bad fan should watch it,but don't expect breaking bad level from this movie. Here's my review of El Camino . So Breaking Bad ended on a cliffhanger note , especially when it came to Jesse's arc. The dude was broken after the countless bad that happened to him throughout the show . And this movie picks up right where the show left off , Jesse driving into the night in a car ( An El Camino) , the rest of the story deals with Jesse covering up the little loose ends , making peace with himself and getting a new life elsewhere. First of all , this movie is shot very well , it looks amazing . It's written and directed by Vince Gilligan , the Creator and showrunner of the show and you can notice his touch on it , it's nailbiting at times , with intense convos and a little bit of black comedy , just like the best epsiodes in the show , which were written and directed by Gilligan . Some of the recurring characters are Badger , Skinny Pete , Jesse's parents , The " get you a new identity guy " and Todd ( god , I hate that guy ! ) , With little flashback cameos from Walt , Jesse , and Mike. Now this movie , despite being rated R is 100% pg 13 , they probably went for it , cause they knew how most kids watched the show and also since it's simultaneously being screened in theatres alongside Netflix . The only gripes I had were that Todd was a little fat in this movie , so seeing him in flashbacks wasn't very convincing , Also I wanted to see how Walt's family were dealing with things , even though it's clearly Jesse's movie . Except for that I thought this movie was amazing ! In the end , it has strong acting , great convos , nailbiting standoffs and the perfect epilogue to breaking bad and a happy ending for Jesse Pinkman. Okay , so maybe the " happy ending " was a spoiler ,but come on, you saw it coming biatch ! Maybe it's been too long ago since I saw Breaking Bad, Talking years now. I loved it then and always will. 10/10<br/><br/>But this movie as much as I wanted to like it I couldn't gel with it. Possibly due to the lack of Walter White content? Who knows... But it brings back memories. Maybe this needs to be watched after re-watching the Breaking Bad series for it to fit into place.<br/><br/>I'll give it another chance for sure one day when I re-watch the series. I had such high expectations as a fan of original series. After 2 hours watching the movie, I can only say- what a pity. Movie, which had a great potential revealed to a boring 2 hours, which could've be spent better. The film explains why some series should be left untouched after last episode, because additional spin-offs or movies could turn up to be hurting the overall image. This is what happened here. In a nutshell- boring, totally lacked Breaking bad feeling, longer than needed to be. As I'm sure most Breaking Bad fans were, I was extremely excited when El Camino was announced a few weeks ago, but seeing it last night was a massive let down. It was sure nice to see some of the old gang again, and the cinematography is fantastic as always, but the plot was very thin and the script was not up to the usual standard.<br/><br/>As an extension of the original story it doesn't really add anything, and as a stand-alone film it would be pretty meaningless.<br/><br/>The way the original series ended Jesse's story was great and left you imagining all sorts of possibilities. I don't want to spoil the ending of El Camino, but it's more of a conclusion and I actually think that's a bit of a shame.<br/><br/>Yesterday I was really hoping this would be the first of many spin-off movies, today I'm really hoping that they can just put the whole thing to bed now. I am lost for words to describe how boring and tedious this film is. No new plot. No good twist. Basically just a film for vince gillian et al to congratulate each other. I found it slow, with bad editing. So that you at times had no idea whether pinkman is dreaming it or not. Definitely a waste of 130mins. Thankfully i paid zero to watch it. Wait until it is in the bargain bin to buy it! Much better than I had hoped for.
Feels like there is truly closure to the story now. 2 hours of my life going worthless only to watch some mummery of actor's binge much older than before with changes of their body's then seeing jessy moving to Alaska.. looooool I'm disappointed and heartbroken. Yes, less is more like in the episode 'Fly', but I found El Camino simply so so so boring - just dragging on and on with pointless scenes and mostly pointless and uninteresting characters. And to be honest it was totally lacking the originality and magic from the series. I just didn't care what happened. And it literally made me cry for how much I miss and love the series. Breaking Bad has always been to me the story of Walt and Jesse, But now the scene with Walt seemed more mandatory than necessary. . Breaking Bad would have deserved something else. I gave 2 stars: one for Aaron and one for Bryan's cameo. But for God's sake why Vince WHY????? Slow, pointless and choppy. Very little makes sense. Lots if flashback fragments that don't add up to much of anything, don't tie up to any of the original material in a significant way. Acted about as lethargically as it gets. Was this the momentum of the original? Hard to tell. Maybe it's just that the new streaming stuff on Netflix & Amazon has so much more zap & dynamism. On top of everything else Aaron Paul/Jesse Pinkman looks 20-30 pounds heavier & healthy yet he's supposed to have been living in a concrete hole. Walter shows up & looks about 20 years older...as I said Just Plain BAD. After such a great inheritence, how come such a 'thing' comes up? Seriously just a timeloss for us, energy loss for rest... We, BB fans, are truly sad... So, this was extremely pointless. Todd's fat. Jesse looks like a dad who is stressed and overweight from eating too much and sitting around, which takes away from the fact that this is supposed to have taken place around the same time as the end of Breaking Bad, where he was a scrawny, underfed, malnourished prisoner; this is only supposed to be a day later... Not only that, Aaron's performance was lacklustre; I watched the last season of Breaking Bad, again this week, and it was EXCEPTIONAL! The whole thing is a solid 10 -- it gets no better. Even Aaron Paul, when he warmed in to it; at the beginning his acting was trash, but he developed.
Now, with Breaking Bad being a hard 10, there's absolutely no freaking way that this even comes close; it was average, at best. Come on, people, actually think!! An absolute waste of time. Could of been so much better. Those marking 10 down to 8 are delusional11 Okay, so the end of breaking bad to me was breathing taking, pure tv magic so when they announced this I was excited because I was such a massive fan, but slightly nervous as to where they were gonna take a story which was wrapped up perfectly. Unfortunately I was right to be nervous. This didn't offer anything new, we knew what awful things Jessie had been subjected to, although I didn't find they really explored his PTSD. Some people had questions when BB ended like is Walter really dead, did they find Hank? Would we see Marie packing up his rock collection (they're minerals Becka!) what happened to Skylar? Was Walter Jr (sorry Flynn's) favourite meal still Breakfast? I'm here to tell you nothing new was brought to the table. All this movie served as was pure nostalgia of seeing a lot of very familiar faces for no real reason or to add anything to the story other than them literally just being there. It felt like a filler episode of Breaking bad, no stand out moments for me. It was nice to see Jessie again but it wasn't an amazing performance by Aaron Paul, the script wasn't strong enough in my opinion, the whole thing just felt phoned in. The entire movie was unbelievable from beginning to end. Aaron Paul is definitely not strong enough to carry an entire movie. I read that there would be no more Breaking Bad. That's not a bad idea. Vince's weaknesses as a writer and director stick out like a sore thumb. Only person not harmed by this turkey was Bryan Cranston and that's because he had the good sense to steer clear of it except for a few minutes. He was excellent. If I was him I'd turn and run the other way if I saw any of the characters approaching me. An excellent way of wrapping up Jesse's story arc but the constant flashbacks could have been integrated into the story better. The flashback of Walt was done well, yet the ones containing Mike and Todd were not as effective as their real life aging took away from their characters. However, this film in no way undermined Felina, which was a major worry to many fans: 8/10 It's a mystery why the producer didn't tell Paul to lose some weight before the shooting started. After a year in a cage the pinkman-caracter should have lost some weight but Paul didn't put any effort at all and the result is an actor with a head twice the size where it should be half the size. El Camino was a treat for us Breaking Bad fans with many call backs and surprise Cameos. First things first, the opening scene with Mike was beautiful. It shows how much of an important figure Mike was to Jesse and it tells you the direction the film is going, which I absolutely loved. Another thing I absolutely loved was Jesse's phone call to his parents. One thing about BB is I always wondered what happened to them after season 3. El Camino perfectly wrapped their story with Jesse in i think what was the best way possible. The acting was amazing as expected, Aaron Paul's (possible) final performance as Jesse was a great way to end his story. However, There were some minor issues I had with this film. In the beginning Jesse's beard was way bigger than the BB finale and this took place right after. Another thing, which I'm sure everyone has issues with was how noticeable it was that Bryan Cranston was wearing a bald cap. I understand why he had to wear it as it would have spoiled his return and that the movie (which at the time was top secret) was being filmed. I also felt some flashbacks were a bit drawn out. All things said El Camino was a great treat and I'm happy we got full closure with Jesse's story. This didn't feel like Breaking Bad at all. Most of the actors were going through a fat phase and then there's Todd(*_*)
Aaron Paul as Jesse rocked his role in every imaginable way. But truly I was expecting a more Tarantino like effect.. I was expecting a bit violence.. a bit more story.. a bit more darkness. But the movie gave me a wholesome feeling. Yeah.. this was wholesome.. and it's different from what you feel when you watch an episode of breaking bad. Breaking Bad is fu**ing amazing.. el camino is wholesome.. more like Breaking GOOD or something. I can totally understand that since Jesse was the good guy in the series. This is a long and drawn out film, that really should have been an hour and 10 mins at most, instead we get far too much, most of the film being shots of the sky.<br/><br/>Do. Not. Watch Totally weist of time. This film it's a shadow of Breaking Bad. I can't understand all the good credits the people made Perfect way to make you realize the what the "team of writers" did on Breaking Bad compared to what Vince G can do when left alone without his foot soldiers to write a script. El Camino is so derivative, so boring and so overlong without coming to any satisfying conclusion, you are forced to think, "This guy wrote Breaking Bad??". This is a movie devoid of any new ideas and pretty much stretches your incredulity in executing sequences which have no basis in logic or reality. This is by-the-numbers plot plodding and so disappointing. Giving it a 6/10 just for the sake of breaking bad. It wasn't so important as breaking bad ended as a masterpiece. fat Todd really Vince As someone who loved the tv show a lot I am extremely disappointed in this "movie". I have been reading the comments that other users have put forward and honestly, who cares about how and where Jesse ends up if the story told of how he gets there is stale and boring and less exciting than watching a snail move across the ground in front of me. People are giving this a 10 star rating because they were got closure. Getting close does not mean something is good and entertaining and it's too simple of a view to have.<br/><br/>It hurts me to write this considering how much I love the show, but I feel that this was created as a marketing ploy and it did not work As many of you ... I am huge mega fan of BB.. watched it many many times ..... watching this movie was a massive disappointment.... I can put it on one single work ... BORING! Till the end I was thinking, something will happen but it left us clueless.<br/><br/>I can tell the story of this movie in a short para: Man escaped, cried, found money, went for a identity change, still less money because deal is deal, killed two man, found money, The vacuum cleaner filtered him.<br/><br/>The season was far more better than this, at least they never failed at surprising with unexpected things. So I fail to see what the point of the whole film was. I watched all of breaking bad and mostly enjoyed it, it was obvious what happened to Jessie I don't see why this film was ever needed. I wasn't expecting much and didn't get much. The runtime could've easily been cut shorter. Nothing special came out of this movie, other than seeing some of the best characters in television again. All in all, a decent addition to this franchise and a welcoming epilogue. I was just can't stop thinking of watching this after trailer, and the movie wasn't the total disappointment.. It was not much like what I expected, but it shows the future of Jesse. From the start of this season, he is intentionally good. But can never stays, as he is like an immature child (optimistically innocent) who can't think the world in bad way, but the universe takes him to this side.<br/><br/>I expected this movie like somewhat the aftermath of Walter's doings as it was the main character of the season and his thinking, behaviorial changes and philosophy were too much perfect, but the movie was totally on an innocent child (a good human) conflicting with his brain on money and humanity. I think his character was not as much good as Walter's (and the director disagreed here).<br/><br/>In the movie his character was like a quite mature man but still after bearing too much cruelity his philosophy of being good still not changed . Maybe he's afraid of that cruelity (as shown), and that's why he's didn't become a psychopath like Joker. Ithink this is the best end im really exited and loved this end Really enjoyed the movie it was satisfying to see Jesse's story Yesterday we watched it on Netflix, after looking forward to it for over a year. It's a dissapointment. How Jesse's story continues seems more like a 'deleted scenes' summary. His story could have been told within 10 minutes.<br/><br/>We're tremendous 'Breaking Bad'-fans, but characters we love so much barely share screentime. Bryan Cranston's appearance as Walt is the most disappointing as he's obviously wearing a bald-cap.<br/><br/>The movie was over before I knew it. I still was expecting something big to happen, and then the movie was already over.<br/><br/>It's a letdown. Much worse than the series. At first glance, it looks like it has been shot if not in the same way, then maybe in a similar fashion. However what stood out in Breaking Bad was even the most meaningless details and scenes were shot as masterpieces.<br/><br/>Here the dialogues are boring. The scenes seem unfinished. The characters - somehow mute, shallow and boring.<br/><br/>All in all, good ending to the story, but much worse than the series. It was contrived and unnecessary. They just used nostalgia to remind us of characters and stories but overall a stinker. The trailer makes the movie look so dramatic and full of tension when it just wasn't. Vince really dropped the bomb. Was he in need of money or just bored? I'm an ardent breaking bad fan and i love all the characters almost equally, but as they say it's better to leave some things as it is. After the strange end to Breaking Bad we all expected something more and then came better call saul which was a huge disappointment in itself, and now comes El Camino.
The problems with this particular movie are the following:<br/><br/>It is atleast 4 years late , had it been released during around 2015-2016 then the connect and the memories in viewers minds would still have been afresh but while watching it i personally felt very little to no connect or reminisce which was extremely disappointing as a fan & viewer<br/><br/>It felt extremely unnecessary and wasteful<br/><br/>It felt unnecessarily stretched and to be brutally honest while viewing it you feel that the writer was out of work for sometime so he decided to pass time by writing something which felt unnecessary<br/><br/>The acting is not top notch,<br/><br/>All in all you wouldn't feel blessed to have watched this movie as you felt after watching breaking bad<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan is no more a genius, first disappointed with better call saul and now El Camino I love how Vince did this movie in style of Breaking Bad but also with drama elements of Better Call Saul. I always wondered what happened to Jesse and now we got solid closure. Scene with one character stole the show for me because it was hillarious and also sad. I remebered how I loved the show when I first watched it and how much fun it was. Hollywood needs to find more roles for Aaron Paul !!! I was SO excited for this movie and I finally got to watch it two days after it came out and when I did I was fighting sleep to stay awake and watch it. It was UNBELIEVABLY boring. It was a series of Jesses's PTSD moments and flashbacks him trying to disappear from Albuquerque. It was very disappointing and not exciting at all and unless something else comes out of it, I won't rewatch it. It was awful. I have absolutely no idea why this movie was made or why they felt they needed to add to the series, At no point did I feel like breaking bad needed an explanation where Jesse ended up. It just feels like a two hour bonus episode at the end of the series where nothing really happens just a forced explanation. Ah the ending for Jessie Pinkman and oh what an ending. Vince Gilligan does it again This is just a terrible follow up and a very disappointing end to a brilliant franchise. So much hype. Such high expectations. You lost me about a minute in. I almost fell asleep. Should have just let the series die with Walter White. It's just too methodical on how they do it, really no surprises or anything along the way. Lady finds M book, for Mexico so Todd kills her bc his money has to be secret, Todd tells Jesse about all his money, says he needs to find a new hiding spot and keep it close. Kandy dude leads him right to his truck after taking the money. Jesse puts a complete ruse on undercover agents while being just around the corner. Convenient key and somehow knowing the safe password, phonebook opens to Kandy address. Wild west showdown.<br/><br/>Jesse has money now, goes to Alaska but no further clarification on why besides talking with Mike who is completely different than Jesse in almost every aspect. The very end about the universe taking you, seems to contradict the decision of going to Alaska in this regard, plus the part about having to cross 2 borders via truck to get there. Apparently he is safe now with his new ID and such to go into town, but then why did he even have to hide?<br/><br/>As for skinny Pete being found in the el camino, who knows.<br/><br/>Continuity was pretty bad. Should have at least been close to the same weight....especially the 2 main actors. If wanted to be bored for two hours I shouldn't have to pay good money for doing it. Whoever green lit this production should be fired. There are many other reviews that go into all of the reasons why this is OK, but pointless. I felt perfect closure when Jesse exploded through the gates and triumphantly drove off. Presumably to start his own story. I was complete. His triumphant joy was cathartic (to me). Instead of charting Jesse's new path this is a mundane two hours of gratuitous cameos and no character development. It's a whole lot o' nuthin'. I read people are saying that Todd got fat what about Jesse? he's been held captive and tortured for months and he's put on weight. In the scene when he gets the gun I would have instantly shot Todd and I don't have a record. When the two guys interrupt his search I would have at least coshed the first one and took a shot at the second. Why all the cameo performance's they didn't add anything relevant to the story. This could have all been wrapped up in a 50 minute episode rathet than a film so they padded it out - but for most of the time Jesse simply didn't behave like a character who had nothing to lose. At first I was wondering why Brock wasn't in it than an I realized he wasn't important to this story and found a profound ending to Jessie's story and now he can finally be happy Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Nothing too major, though because nothing particularly major happens in the 2 hour runtime.<br/><br/>This is worth watching if you are looking for lots of cameos from across the series of BB which don't really add a great deal to the story.<br/><br/>>Todd's character gets fleshed out (both in body and wonderfully psychotic personality) and is probably the highlight of the movie. Even though his flashback scenes are, for the most part, totally unnecessary to the plot.<br/><br/>>Jessie completely recovers from what appears to be severe PTSD in about 36 hours.<br/><br/>>Walt gets one of the most irrelevant shoehorned flashback cameos I have ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>>Skinny Pete and Badger just disappear in the first act. (As does the car after which the movie is actually named..) No sign of the police closing in on Jessie or any of the interrogations shown in the trailer. If youre looking for the tense manhunt that was implied by the trailer you're in for a bit of a letdown.
MEGASPOILER: Skinny Pete's hair is like a Loreal advert. Yes. He takes off that beanie.<br/><br/>Honestly, it's a bit like getting a wendy from Wendy - You enjoy it at the time, but immediately afterwards you realise it was all actually quite a bad idea... could've been worse though.<br/><br/>Why couldn't they just crack on with the next series of Saul instead!? Perfect closure to Pinkman's Story without harming the legacy of the show which sequels/spin-offs usually do. A must watch for every Breaking Bad fan.
In the end, it simply leaves you wanting for more. It was a cool ending for Jesse, but aside from nostalgia and fan service I didn't feel like this movie has something else to offer. If you are expecting a Breaking Bad level of storytelling, villains and action, you will be disappointed. If you miss Breaking Bad and want to relive some of its characters then you will be pleased. El Camino gave fans of the breaking bad universe a final epilogue to the story. In particular, the final story of Jessie Pinkman. We got to see what really happened to him after he escaped from the compound. It was always a mystery left to the viewers own imagine as to what happened moments after he smashed through those gates. Now we get long awaited closure.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this little conclusion of Jessie. I got to relive the epic campaign of breaking bad just a tiny bit more. It showed only relevant detail to what was missed at the end of BB. It didn't attempt to dramatically spike a twist or reinvent anything which I appreciated.<br/><br/>Fans and critics would have had the bar set high for this movie. It did well to add the series's without tainting it's great image. It was honestly just a good respectful way to end everything that was untold from the main series. Maybe I'm criticizing this more because Breaking Bad was the best or one of the best shows ever made. This seemed like a mostly uneventful episode stretched out to slightly over 2 hours. Todd was significantly heavier than he was at the end of BB. The Walter White scene was exciting to start but seemed almost like he didn't know what to say. Would have loved to see WW more. And the way Breaking Bad ended...Machine gun, millions of dollars changing hands, the death of the lead character...I couldn't imagine how exciting the end of this movie would be. But it ended with him driving a beat up car in a turtle neck in Alaska?! The ending credits lasted longer than the exciting moments of this movie. Don't get me wrong it's not a horrible movie. But when you put Breaking Bad in the title, expectations go through the roof and this movie just didn't meet them From the trailers it was obvious that this was gonna be a character-driven film. And like the show, it's a slow-burn. If you thought there was gonna be alot of action and CGI explosions or whatever then that's a YOU problem, it's not the movie's problem. Nothing ever gave the impression that this was going to be any thing more than what it ended up being, an epilogue of Breaking Bad. Whether you think it's neccesary is irrelevant. Vince thought it was, which is the only thing that matters.<br/><br/>Don't let the angry GOT fans, still mad their finale was awful, give you the wrong impression. This is an absolutely solid and must-watch film. Honestly, I loved it! After all these years seeing Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman was great. Anyone who watched breaking bad would also appreciate it. Yeah, it's not as thrilling as Breaking Bad, but it is natural. That was the story of transformation, this is the story of moving on. Still kudos, perfect!!! This a prove that anything without Bryan is just a subordinary piece. Bryan is the man of breaking bad , not anyone else ! What can I really say? Aaron Paul's acting is greater than ever. Flashbacks are a great nostalgic letter sent by Vince Gilligan and the cameos which also add something to the story are unbelievable. If you loved Breaking Bad, then you won't be disappointed after this film which is really hard after a great season finale. The callbacks are really present. It may be slow paced but not boring at all. Todd's scenes were gold, and the acting of all the cast is awesome. Great movie directly to the oscars This just reminded me how annoying pinkmen could be at times, the ending to the show was perfect this is just fanboy material. Continuing right after the events of Breaking Bad Season 5, El Camino follows the sole survivor and one of the main characters from the hit series, Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Jessie is now wounded (mentally and physically) after being tortured and a captive. Now on the run, he will try to reconnect with his friends in order to escape the city and run from his past.<br/><br/>El Camino's style feels more like an additional TV episode of Breaking Bad. If you're expecting a big budget film with lots of actors you're going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed seeing the return of Aaron Paul's performance and it's obvious the actor is passionate about this character as he attempts to provide closure to fans. El Camino is also to be praised in regards to filming as I feel the style is very consistent in lining up with previous series.<br/><br/>Thoughout the film's duration we are also given extra plot details about Jessie's past and addition scenes we never saw within the original series. This is a creative way for the writers to bring back the characters we once loved along with attempting to give fans additional story and depth to Jessie as a leading man.<br/><br/>While seeing returning characters from the series is exciting, sadly the film's overall basic plot does drag on and gives very little to fans. Going back to the past at times also provides little story and interest for the audience. In the end, this film didn't serve any major purpose and personally I would still have been happy had I never seen this.<br/><br/>Overall, while it sounds exciting to witness the 1st Breaking Bad film, it's actually left me feeling dissatisfied. The film's plot is really a story which could have told been told in a 5 minute montage. That being said, the film does continue the story faithfully along with going down memory lane and adding some additional basic plot points. Fun for some and dull for a selected crew.<br/><br/>5.0/10
Walkden Entertainment Complete waste of time, nothing happens from start to finish except a lot of time jumps back to the series. Loved Breaking Bad but this film is just bad It's almost impossible for a sequel to achieve the same quality as the original. Of course the good thing is that the producers know they will make money because they have a built in audience. This sequel is almost worthless, in almost every respect. The direction stands out - so many times I fast forwarded through what I anticipated were worthless time-fillers. The editing was questionable, and the acting was disappointing, to say the least. So, I spent the last 2 weeks re-watching my beloved and top-favorite show, Breaking Bad, to get ready for this long-waited movie.<br/><br/>I'm more than disappointed, and I really can't understand how it got such high ratings and reviews. Its story is so lame and weak, it's nothing close to the brilliance of the show, where every episode would left you wowing of the smart ideas and intense dialogues, which this movie got non of.
Even the happy moment of Jesse & Walt reunion was taken away from me by that stupid dialogue ðŸ˜•<br/><br/>Sadly, Netflix is more about the fuss than the content. I wish I didn't see it! I liked it better not knowing exactly what happened to Jessie. Knowing less is better sometime. If you're gonna show us, at least make it amazing. Not asking for a fairytale ending but I just didn't see much of the point of this film. By the time it ended, I was like "that's it???" Oh well...At least it wasn't horrible. I was a fan of BB, but still can't bring myself ro give this any more than 6. As someone wrote it's like 2 more average episodes. Thare is nothing wrong with that, but I was expecting Vince will bring something more to the table after a few years since the last episode. This way I feel it was just quick cash cow. I thought maybe this movie would show us what happened with Jessie - in the future. We all pretty much already figured out he probably made it away, considering the ending of season 5. This just felt like a movie made for fans to munch brainlessly on, with cameos just for you to go "oh ey, cool, it's Walt!" even though it's absolutely not memorable. What I loved about BB was that every time a character opened their mouths, something relevant came out, something memorable or something to push the plot. Here there was nothing. Badger and Pete weren't even funny. Moments seemed as dragged out as is the tendency of Better Call Saul (especially the first episode). Jessie and Todd were fat, Todd distractingly so. This would have been fine had he been a survivor and this was taking place in the future, but now you want me to believe he gained weight, then radically lost it before getting shot? Seriously. It made it feel like these actors didn't take reappearing in this movie seriously at all. How can the actor for Todd (whatever his name) drag himself into a long awaited movie looking like he aged twenty years knowing he's supposed to look like not a day went by?? I mean c'mon, make a little effort, dude. It's embarrassing. If I'd been the director, I'd have fired him for it and said it wouldn't work for continuity purposes. The hell were they thinking. He could at least have tried to suck in his tummy, elongate his neck, you know, all the things us women do all the time being constantly made more aware of our weight and how angles affect it. Had he been a woman he'd probably been fired if not had his career ended, I swear. The bar is certainly high for men. So yeah, I agree, this brought nothing to the table whatsoever. Bummer. /Shrug To see Todd in this shape made me happy because I am not the only one who is struggling with his weight ;-) The movie is good enough to stand on its own, but ultimately it is uneventful and unnecessary. Paul should lose some weight for his iconic role, during watching the show, I can not concentrate on the story because his chubby face . Wow overlong and kinda boring with only sparks of the old breaking bad days, could of had more action in it, great acted though by who was present.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to get confirmation of something, because I feel they could of left it open - so from that point early on in the movie, I was watching for the sake of it, hoping something good would happen, but apart from (one important flashback) that was it.<br/><br/>Where can the franchise go from here - nowhere.<br/><br/>Better call saul - we had better see that show ramping up because that is the only way this franchise will continue in some shape or form.<br/><br/>Was expecting a lot more from the movie, heartbroken and unfulfilled - but this is not for the great acting, would of been a lot worse. Before anyone moans about me being a fat shamer or anything like that, I'm not. However, Jessie is much fatter in the face in this film and wasn't anywhere near that size in BB.<br/><br/>Surely he would have been underfed in the cage and therefore the story should have dictated he be thinner. They should have made Aaron Paul and Jesse Plemens both lose weight for this film. They're size totally distracted from how they should have looked.<br/><br/>Shame really. This could have been a great film. It wasn't. Plays as a slow burn addition to the final episode. Nothing too impressive here, especially if you weren't a big fan of the original series. I wouldn't recommend it as a stand alone movie.<br/><br/>Slow but well done. Id have a hard time recommending the movie to anyone who didn't watch the TV show from A to Z At this moment, I find the movie to have a 7.8 rating, which is cool, as I literally gave it a 7.5 in my mind upon viewing yesterday.<br/><br/>I was excited to see what kind of new stuff they had in store, but was already wondering how much more excitement there could be-- given the resolution of most issues in the Breaking Bad finale. So, naturally, they fill some of the 2 hr. run time with flashbacks, and weird scenes from Jesse's past. All of them are pretty decent, though, dredging up some cameos from some favorites, including Walter himself. I was disappointed about not seeing Lawyer Saul or the Chicken Man or some of my other personal faves, but no big deal.<br/><br/>I won't give too much away, but I did enjoy the "Wild West" shootout, in which Jesse pulls a classic Clint Eastwood move by faking the guys out with one pistol, while blasting from his pocket with another. There are some good and tense moments, but I was hoping for a little more action, and some of the flashbacks leave you like, "WTF???" Like, why would Todd ever risk bringing Jesse everywhere alone, and why would Jesse not take multiple opportunities to escape? Stockholm syndrome, or total fear of Uncle Jack's Biker Brigade?? Perhaps, but I thought the whole disposal of a cleaning lady with these two was absurd, given the circumstances. Fun, but absurd.<br/><br/>I must have missed something about the guys posing as cops. I don't really remember precisely why they were involved, but I need to go back and rewatch the series I guess. Maybe they worked for the Pest Company? I can't recall, but that was still a tense standoff.<br/><br/>Overall, this is fun romp down memory lane, but also feels a bit unnecessary. It doesn't hurt any credibility of the stars or story, so I guess they pulled off a basic success. It definitely entertained me as a fan of the show and spin-offs; I just would have added a couple other elements or scenes to spice it up. Enjoy... Really great way to end Jesse's story with this sequel movie that is beautifully shot and has great tension throughout. I just think the Todd scenes lasted too long and they could have been replaced with some more screen time for Badger and Skinny Pete. Jesse having the "Wild West" stand-off with the main villain of the movie felt very Breaking Bad to me. Overall it's a fulfilling and happy ending to Jesse's long and difficult journey through the 2 years that Breaking Bad takes place. El Camino : A Breaking Bad Movie serves as an excellent conclusion to Jesse Pinkman's story, and doesn't ruin the untouchable finale of Breaking Bad : Felina. The emotions of a man suffering with PTSD and many mental scars is fantastically portrayed by a career-best performance from Aaron Paul. Every actor's performance in this movie shines, and brings to life a compelling story created by the excellent Vince Gilligan. The movie shares DNA with Breaking Bad, and is an excellent follow on to give a conclusion as to where Jesse Pinkman has headed. I loved breaking bad and the only thing that made the finale less than perfect was that Jesse's fate was left unknown. This movie solves that. I liked it, it was good. I only have a couple of nitpicks that aren't even worth mentioning. This movie is a Breaking Bad movie, nothing more, nothing less. Aaron Paul is still amazing in the role of Jesse Pinkman and so are the newcomers as well. There's a few surprises along the way and I enjoyed it very much. Go freaking watch it. Yes! Yes! Yes! Thanks Vince Gilligan.
This is what we needed, about time too.<br/><br/>Overall, not as good as BB but a great effort. Glad to see that the Breaking Bad recipe for tense drama still works. I've felt that Better Call Saul divested itself of drugs, guns, money, and the constant specter of violence in favor of tensions between scheming lawyers, and it lost what made Breaking Bad must see TV. El Camino kept me on the edge of my couch wondering what would happen next to Jesse and his surviving friends and family, just like in the good old days when he and Mr. White were usually just one step away from being caught or murdered. I'd have given it a perfect rating, but it did lack a couple of things. There was very little comic relief, which Breaking Bad could often introduce with a strange camera angle or over the top characters like Tuco, his tio, or the twins. El Camino made me worry, but it didn't make me laugh. Secondly, there were almost no women anywhere. It may be that drug dealing and the violence that goes with organized crime are mostly the domain of men, but not exclusively so. A story without a major female character is always missing something. Lydia gave it that in BB, along with Skyler and her sister. There is no one like that here. I have to say first and foremost Aaron Paul is one hell of an actor. He can make you feel exactly what the actor in the scene feels at each moment.
This extended preview on Jesse Pinkman's life and how it plays out is pretty perfect if you ask me. I very much loved the story and it truly felt like you were watching a new season of the show. Sadly it was over to quickly even though it was a 2hr movie. I also enjoyed that Netflix had full rights to this movie and you didn't have to go to theaters even though I am sure it would've hit top ranks on the box office.
I don't enjoy spoilers in reviews so I will not go on to say anything that happens but it was truly an incredible movie!!!
It was also so nice to see Brian Cranston (Walter) make an apperance/cameo in a flashback....if it was in theaters I truly could hear in my head everyone shouting and screaming the moment his face hit the screen. As a big fan og the tv show, this was very welcomed, and I enjoyed every bit of it. It seems like its the untold ending for Pinkmans role, that we never really got from the original show.<br/><br/>With that said, I kind of expected more from a 2 hour movie. It felt to much like a long tv episode.
Never the less i would welcome more from that universe. As a huge breaking bad fan I couldn't wait to see El Camino. I was hoping that the director will surprise me an Walter White would somehow survived the shooting in the last episode and would have an appearance in El Camino. Unfortunately he didn't. What is not true since there is a short scene but only a flashback. Which actually is the highlight of the movie.
The story is ok. As a Breaking Bad fan you need to watch it. But if you honest to yourself as fan and if you wouldn't see Breaking Bad before the feedback would be somehow disappointing. I was expecting more and it was somehow lame. Walter was the maine character and without him this whole thing don't work. If The producers would make a movie with Walter White I am pretty convinced that it would have much more power to satisfy the audience.
Final comment is: not bad - but not a must see Netflix knows it is about to be contested by formidable competitive streaming sites. From an executive business level, this was a good and desperate attempt at one final cash grab before it goes the way of Blockbuster video. Gilligan, being loyal (and NF did play a huge part in BB's success to be fair), agreed to bust out a movie to help them out, and he did a fine job in it being a decent and not bad movie, but it's just one where you can see Netflix's trademark soullessness playing a hand in it.<br/><br/>Netflix movies are 99% of the time like movies that are basically "genre paint by numbers" movies. Like, if you want a thriller, it will be a generic thriller with nothing special or standing out. If you want a romance, you'll get a cookie-cut romance. If you want a drama, it will be the most cliched plot that you can imagine with banal acting and storytelling. Hey, I mean, there is definitely a market out there for people who think mediocrity is good and don't have a problem being insulted and exposed to underachieving work.<br/><br/>That being said, El Camino is actually a decent film that is worth a viewing, especially for Breaking Bad fans. This is because Gilligan does his best to meet Netflix's "formula" while still keeping it quirky in the Breaking Bad dark humor that satisfied many fans, in addition to some formidable acting from Jesse Plemons, Aaron Paul, and Robert Forster.<br/><br/>I wanted to rave about this movie and love it, but the more I think about it, the more disappointing it seems, and I was finally able to put my finger on it when it was confirmed how big of a role Netflix played in its production. This is taking nothing away from the director and performances, but the way the story is dumbed down makes El Camino nothing in the way of being "a Breaking Bad movie" they tried to advertise it as, with the exception that many familiar faces and characters make an appearance. Why is this film so utterly boring and slow? Did anyone find themselves wanting to sleep because I sure did. I love the breaking bad series but I found nothing new not exciting to make it worth opening my eyes for. Good to see old faces but that's it! Just because netflix popularized the show it doesnt mean it would be fit to produce a movie of the same caliber. I don't blame any of the actors or Vince, I just think they trusted the wrong, amateur people to do the project. I mean, look at their productions at all.<br/><br/>Giving 7 stars for the nostalgia sake. Well... this was a crushing disappointment.<br/><br/>I loved Breaking Bad back in the day; I know that's not a controversial opinion at all. I particularly loved how it ended, so much so that I was sceptical when it was announced that Vince Gilligan apparently had more Breaking Bad to give us.<br/><br/>Long story short: this movie also ends with Jesse Pinkman driving off in a car; similar to how his story ended on Breaking Bad. Oh sure, he's evaded the cops, got some cash, sent a letter to Brock and set up a new life for himself, but... isn't that what we assumed he was going to do anyway? Did we really need to see it?<br/><br/>There were no more antagonists left in this story, given that Gus and his associates and all the nazis were dead, so the haphazardly introduced criminals here to cause conflict were a bit of a joke (and don't get me started on that out of nowhere duel scene- what was that all about?)<br/><br/>The flashbacks felt like deleted scenes from the original series, the kind you'd expect to watch on a DVD or Bluray boxset, and in hindsight often failed to add much to the story (was I excited in the moment to get a "new" Walt + Jesse scene? Yes. Does it feel satisfying now, after sitting with the movie for a while and realising how little it added to either character? No, not really).<br/><br/>Mind you, Aaron Paul's great, and gives this movie much more than its half-baked, anticlimactic screenplay deserves (although it is handsomely shot, I'll give it that- the Breaking Bad team's ability to shoot a desert in spectacular fashion is second only to Sergio Leone).<br/><br/>If you loved this, honestly I'm jealous. I wanted to, despite my scepticism, and while I didn't actively dislike the experience of watching it, nor did I find it too boring (for the most part), thinking about it now makes me feel tired and empty. This is a real nothing movie; an all but useless epilogue that I honestly don't think needed to exist. No purpose at all. Wasted 2h of my life.
For those who asked themselves were did Jesse go. And not really...<br/><br/>Nothing to do with the TV show.
Different vibe, tempo.<br/><br/>Could have done something much more interesting using flash backs, forward. Detailing any relevant stuff with Heisenberg or even Saul doing something.<br/><br/>Movie has potential, but it doesnt deliver. The super fan that I am I've waited this movie to happen for almost a year. I followed every source I could find to get the tidbits about that super secret project. Although I knew that it would be some sort of disappointment since Walt wouldn't obviously have a significant role in it I still chose to give it a benefit of a doubt. You know, Vince Gilligan's genius and integrity etc. I was even going to upgrade my internet connection to secure perfect viewing! And as soon the movie hit the Netflix on Friday I was ready!<br/><br/>But! About 10 minutes into it I felt literally painful to watch it, it was just dragging on and on but out of respect of the series I wanted to finish it anyway. I probably dozed off at some point, hard to say really. It doesn't even deserve any deeper analysis, the movie was awful in every way and as a fan I feel INSULTED! It has nothing that made Breaking Bad the legend that it is. For me Breaking Bad ends with Baby Blue. A sequel, of sorts, to Breaking Bad following Jesse Pinkman after the events captured in the finale of Breaking Bad. Jesse is now on the run, as a massive police manhunt for him is in operation. He has a plan to get out of Albuquerque, but he'll need heaps of cash to do it. Luckily, he knows where some may be stashed.<br/><br/>An interesting and entertaining spin-off of Breaking Bad, written and directed by Vince Gilligan (the creator of Breaking Bad). Not an essential spin-off, I might add: the series ended superbly in a wonderfully poetic manner. I never felt I needed to know what happened to Jesse after he escaped the events of the final scene. Still, I don't mind the idea of us following Jesse's story post-Walter White.<br/><br/>An interesting story it is, filled with tension, action, tricky situations, twists and a few good comedic moments. Very engaging for all of the 2 or so hours of the movie. Nice ending.<br/><br/>Not brilliant though. While Gilligan largely manages to capture the atmosphere of Breaking Bad, this being a movie he doesn't have the same amount of time to construct the storyline that made Breaking Bad such compelling viewing. The movie never rises above being more than entertaining. There's no great profundity or payoff, it's simply a good drama. Now we know what happens to Jesse. Its no longer an ambiguous conclusion to his character. With satisfying nods to the Breaking Bad series, El Camino not only succeeds in pleasing fans of the show, but also works as a stand-alone manhunt film. Aaron Paul gives a great performance as Pinkman, as well. Hopefully we see him get more roles in the near future. Vince Gilligan is a master of story-telling and I cannot wait to see what else he has up his sleeve. Truly a great extension to the Breaking Bad universe...never felt like a tacked-on part of the story. I'm sure all the fanboys will say its the best thing since sliced bread but it wasn't great, wasn't bad either just an alright movie in the familiar style of BB with a wrap up of Jesse' story. Was it required? Probably not but reasonably entertaining nonetheless. This definitely was the right way for a post breaking bad movie. With Jessie on the run from the DEA,Cops,FBI literally everyone he still gets into some trouble while trying to get money and the scenes with Walt and Jesse just to see Walt was the best and it sets up for what could happen at the end of better call saul The plot of the movie isn't something unexpected. I wouldn't say that it is boring or bad, but it isn't something that you definitely need to watch. The movie didn't give that Breaking bad feeling at all.
In my opinion Breaking bad ended perfectly and nothing else needed to be added in the story, but as a big fun of the series I was curious to watch the movie. I watched this twice. The second time was even more satisfying. This is a tense, beautifully executed, even thoughtful, fulfillment of Jesse's story. The narrative moves the story logically, with flashbacks that tell us more about who Jesse is and make even more sense of his journey. Not only that, but Gilligan's dark humor ignites a few bombs as well. And Aaron Paul's skills are even greater than they were in BrBa. Loved it. I gave this movie 6 stars out of love, okay. Love for BrBa and the actors and for Vince Gilligan before he lost his mind. I mean, the man cannot be right and believe that this mindbogglingly flat and soulless movie was good. Even the "big" cameo flashback was a big WTF? You gotta see it to believe it, how disconnected it was from the narrative, just shoe-horned in with no regard for the scene before or after or what was going on with Jesse in the present. God bless Paul, he was giving it his all. He would have killed it with a good script. It could have been more to this movie. I'm a big Breaking Bad fan so i expected more. That ginger guy is also fat so that ruined the experience for me The ending to Breaking Bad is largely considered the best ending of a TV Series to date. The only question people had was, "well what happened to Jesse"?<br/><br/>This movie feels like a slow burn double episode of the original series, which gives the satisfying ending the fans always wanted for Jesse.<br/><br/>There are some notable cameos and flashbacks, some with more impact than other. They are however always relevant to the story, and aren't there to just pay homage to it's predecessor.<br/><br/>Essential viewing for fans of the show. Since this is the continuation of the story of where Breaking Bad left off, it would be unrealistic to not look at this as a new episode in the series. Is it a bad episode? No. Is it a memorable one? Not really. It lacks the flair and intelligence of the series but carries on the style and overall feel.<br/><br/>Jesse is on the run. Amazing.., wow, the director creates in this movie, the story started right after the series ended.
In breaking bad we saw the end story's of all characters like the most popular character Walter white and maik hank skayler and her son, but jessy we don't know what happened to him, so the movie is talking to what happened to Jessy pinkman after he escaped. I saw this movie while my expectation bar was set very high, and it really paid off. A fair farewell to Jesse. Breaking Bad is my favorite TV show of all time, so I was leery when I heard a sequel movie was being made. Once I heard Vince Gilligan was writing and directing though, my fears were alleviated. If anyone could properly expand on such a masterpiece, it's Gilligan. I can confidently say that El Camino provides a fitting epilogue to the story of Breaking Bad. It's more so two extra episodes of the show versus a full-length film, which is fine by me. It's slower paced and character focused, just like the show. Aaron Paul is tremendous and Gilligan's signature shots fill up the screen, as do tons of Easter eggs for hardcore fans.<br/><br/>While I don't think a conclusion to Jesse's story was necessary, now that's it here, I'm glad we got it. El Camino was like an epilogue after you the story has ended in a book. The epilogue will be satisfying and good if the book was good. The epilogue for one of the best series ever created will be also good and El Camino has done justice to the series. It was sentimental, thrilling and giving us deja vu as much as they can. Aaron Paul gave a performance which was on par with his terrific performance in Breaking Bad. The direction and cinematography was also decent. Breaking Bad gave a perfect ending for Walter White and Jesse Pinkman got his in El Camino. I say it right away. Breaking Bad is my favorite series. I am in love with all the characters in this series, especially Walter White and the protagonist of El Camino, Jesse Pinkman. This Jesse, tortured by the neo-Nazis, has just been saved by his former partner and will try to flee the police who is obviously looking for him. The film is the direct result of the series and .. Do not serve much. That we agree, the film is not bad at all, we follow it with pleasure, it is well paced and it's great to find these characters who have changed for the most part, yes I look at you Tod and your extra 20 kilos .. But without spoiler, Jesse has no evolution in this movie, he does not change at all, he is just as ingenious and daring as at the end of the last season. The last shot of Jesse in the show was certainly not a closed end for the character but it was so beautiful. He was happy, out of this rotten world, finally free. The message was clear, as a spectator, I was thrilled with this end, I did not need to see what was going to happen to him. In any case there were only two possible outcomes that I had imagined, and the film takes one of these, without surprises. All I want to say is that Breaking Bad and especially Jesse Pinkman did not need this movie. The last new images of this cult character are much less striking than those of the season 5 and it is rather a pity. But again, El Camino does not shame Breaking Bad at all, and recalls why it's one of the best shows of all time. Brilliant acting, cinematography and writing made BB the best TV show of all times.<br/><br/>El Camino is 2 out of 3. Vince Gilligan wrote the movie on his own and I feel like he could have used some input from the other writers.
Every episode of BB was carefully crafted, always inspired and full of surprises. And they never underestimated their audience. You had to pay attention.<br/><br/>El Camino builds on Felina's premise that Jesse has to escape and find the money to start a new life in Alaska.
And that's pretty much what we get.<br/><br/>In the beginning we still feel the excitement of Felina. He's a man on the run, struggling with his past.
But then the movie doesn't follow through. Jesse seems to overcome his trauma rather quickly.
The new villain isn't a real threat and the urgency of the first act is gone.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are entertaining but they don't really work in context of the overall story of BB. Especially the final shootout seems out of character for Jesse.<br/><br/>Todd's weight is hard to overlook. Same with the age difference of most of the other actors. The necessary CGI probably would have blown up the budget.<br/><br/>El Camino is good and it's hard to live up to BB's legacy.
Aaron Paul's acting and Vince Gilligan's directing are fantastic as always but as a die-hard fanboi this movie left me a little disappointed. A sequel can be enjoyed even if you haven't seen the first part like terminator 2 (just an example). This is not like that. If you haven't seen BrBa then I would suggest you watch it because it is the most glorious way to conclude some left over threads of a supremely knitted story. Fantastic. For people asking whether or not they should watch the entirety of "Breaking Bad" before seeing this film, the answer, in short, is yes. There is much in "El Camino" to captivate the interest of those who haven't embraced the famous, five-season methamphetamine epic, but you may still be somewhat lost. The entire film focuses on Jesse Pinkman's consternation (and, eventually, deliverance), and without knowing him as fully as "Breaking Bad" has illustrated, you will at times just be following a PTSD-ridden adult with scars on his face.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone piece, "El Camino" suffers from this. The film is tied directly to its predecessor, and while it cannot exist without the TV show, the reverse does not apply. At the end of the day, this is a crowd-pleaser - one that is completely unnecessary, but that satisfies anyways, as long as you're a fan. Luckily, the filmmakers understood this. It received a Netflix release instead of theater distribution, it features a narrow-scoped story, and the words "A Breaking Bad Movie" are literally in the title. This self-awareness liberates the film from having to be some revelatory character study that can be shown to the masses. It is an add-on; a brief dessert if you so love Vince Gilligan's style.<br/><br/>To be sure, "El Camino" is still a well-made film. Gilligan wrote and directed it, with his deft understanding of all the characters involved and keen eye for a good shot. It is also a great personal joy to revisit the scenic vista of the great Southwest, and the cinematography that has come to be associated with the Breaking Bad universe always aims to enchant - or, in some more suspenseful cases, intimidate. I felt palpable dread on multiple occasions as Jesse traversed his new hyperattentive world, one which is out to get him at every turn. At other times, I could sigh at the rustic, cantaloupe-colored deserts we've learned to distrust so much, deserts which make bold reappearances here. I would also venture to say that every appearance of a known character was pulled off with tact and grace; even with the cameo of a particularly special person, there were no groans to be had.<br/><br/>Now, the man himself, our Captain Cook - Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman. He's a star with serious ability, and graduating from supporting character to lead role suits him well. He will play curiously with an insect, even after all the torture and loss he's experienced, reflecting Jesse's soft internal nature. He will also kill, with extreme reluctance, in order to survive. It doesn't come across as the smoothest character examination in recent history, but it's believable, and, perhaps more importantly, consistent with the meth cook we've come to root so hard for. The film does not, however, try to build on new storylines. Instead, it closes ties, and feels like a 120-minute addition to the original "Breaking Bad" finale. Because of this, I predict nobody will talk about "El Camino" years from now, or even in the next few months. It just wasn't a groundbreaking film in any sense of the word. Given this, would I say that Vince Gilligan achieved the maximum potential for the film he WAS creating? Maybe. I guess we'll never know. There is no bad taste in my mouth, but no lasting impression either. It was just... Decent.<br/><br/>6.5/10 for the enjoyable vasectomy of Jesse Pinkman's story. Let me just first say a word about Breaking Bad. Although undoubtedly a highlight in TV history, a very over hyped show for what it is. Often hailed as the best TV show of all time, a statement which I don't necessarily agree with. I feel like it's something people just say without really having a grasp on the history of great TV shows or the art form. Although a great series, I wouldn't put it on such a high pedestal.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why this movie was made to be honest. It's kind of just a giant fan favour in and of itself. Maybe it was just made as a money grabber or maybe it's something Gilligan personally wanted to do to complete the story of Jesse Pinkman. We may never know, but I don't see the need for this movie nor the purpose it's supposed to fill. Don't get me wrong - it's a well made movie and a decent watch, but it falls short as something just floating around for someone to watch in their boredom.<br/><br/>I don't think there's much more to add to the story of Breaking Bad and that's a reason why this movie falls flat. There simply isn't much to do with Pinkman's character at this point and the whole movie is something I imagine most people would think of as the fate of the character. It gives a satisfying ending to Jesse but that's pretty much everything there's to take home from it.<br/><br/>We get to see many of the beloved and the not so beloved characters: Badger, Skinny Pete, Todd, Mike, Jane, the vacuum salesman and of course Walter White. Some of whom you could cynically say are thrown in there just to serve to purpose of "Hey I've seen that character before, therefore I'm excited", although in fairness some of them are worked in to have some meaning in the story. Jesse Plemons by the way, as in the original series, is absolutely great here playing the chill inducing Todd, one of the best elements of the movie and the series.<br/><br/>So, is it worth a watch? For the Breaking Bad fans, sure, why not. It's a well made movie and a decent watch. With all the hype, don't raise you're expectations too high though. "What happened to Jesse" is the big cliffhanger from the end of the series. It is right up there with the Tony Soprano question and what is in the Pulp Fiction briefcase. To some extent leaving Jesse's fate unknown has been great to think about, because there were so many possibilities. This movie resolves it, and in a very satisfying way.<br/><br/>It is true that it is about as good as an average Breaking Bad episode, but worth watching.<br/><br/>One has to get over the fact that all of the actors are older, and it shows, but let's face it, the only people that are really interested in this movie are true Breaking Bad fans (and there are certainly a lot) so I don't think that any of us really mind that. We get it. It has been a few years.<br/><br/>Do not watch unless you have already seen the series. Basically this works as a last episode. Breaking bad now finale done and finished!!
one of the best short movies ever What you get from this film will depend on your expectations.<br/><br/>For me, it was an OK film and worth watching, and it explains what happens to Jesse - which really isn't that interesting. Not a movie, just a representation/display of what was left to the imagination in Felina.
Absolutely unnecessary and also kills the iconic exit of Jesse Pinkman from the world of Heisenberg in the last seconds of Felina. I tested this on my girlfriend, who has not seen Breaking Bad. I simply did not tell her that the movie we were about to see had anything to do with BB :)<br/><br/>She hated it.<br/><br/>Myself, on the other hand, liked it. But I have seen and love BB. While the acting, as always, is phenomenal... the plot is so severely lacking that I had trouble even identifying what it was. My best guess: Jesse has memories of what happened to him, he thinks he's going to be killed or go to jail, he decides to start over with a new life and new identity. So he does.<br/><br/>Not really much of a plot. There are no major twists- I can only think of one twist off the top of my head and it was hardly exciting or surprising. There's a lot of "hurry up and wait." And then the viewer just... waits. And waits... and plays around on their phone until something happens.<br/><br/>The flashback scenes can be a little confusing because it's hard to remember every single little thing that happened to Jesse when he was captured. There's a flashback scene with Walter- which was arguably the most exciting part of the entire movie... mostly because I actually thought it was present day and that Walter and Jesse had somehow both managed to pull off this crazy thing where Walter's death was faked and they had both gotten away and we're starting over. But no, just another flashback that basically meant nothing.<br/><br/>The one thing I got out of this is that it pretty much confirmed my suspicion Gene from Cinnabon aka Jimmy McGill aka Saul Goodman is the doing of Mr. Vacuum Repairman.<br/><br/>Speaking of... time spent working on this movie would have been MUCH better spent on the production of Better Call Saul. They can be better!! It must be a second movie. We want Walter White!! I am a type of fan who watches Breaking Bad fan-made videos almost every week to refresh the unforgettable experience this brilliant Tv series gave me. You can only imagine how excited I was for this BB movie. I thought that the genius of Vince Gilligan would once again shock the audience.<br/><br/>However, although it's the last thing I would want to admit, the movie left me disappointed. Not that I expected or wanted Walter White to rise from the grave, I just wished to see what could possibly happen to Jesse beyond our imagination (I mean, I am a true Breaking Bad fan, I have imagined millions of ways how things could have gone for Jesse Pinkman). This was one of the most ordinary and unimpressive endings for Jesse that Gilligan could give us.<br/><br/>With all my due respect to Aaron Paul, I think he got a little too old for Jesse Pinkman's character. His emotions seemed a little too forced to me. However, those several minutes of Bryan Cranstone's appearance really made this movie for me personally. His acting was nothing short of fascinating. After all these years, he managed to stay in Walt's element. He was so convincing, so natural, so professional.<br/><br/>Anyways, Vince Gilligan, I will forever be grateful for the greatest TV show ever- Breaking Bad. Unfortunately this movie is yet another proof that no one, not even you, can create a show higher that that. But we did gain fascinating insight into Todd's musical tastes. Many folks who are giving it a 9 or 10 are saying that we shouldn't expect it to be better or equal to BB. I wasn't and I don't think many of us did either. However the movie lacks resolution in many parts and the stories are not well connected. These two things are what annoyed me most. Though there is one underlying story, there are side stories that don't seem to be resolved and stories that don't clearly show a connection I thought at first that nobody needs this movie, the original ending was perfect. Then again, I thought nobody needed the prequel series either, and that turned out brilliant. El Camino is an entertaining, very well made epilogue. It brought me joy and closure. Unnecessary, perhaps, but much appreciated. When I first saw the trailer I thought the movie will be set on 2019 after the events of Breaking Bad but the movie took place the second breaking bad ended to show how Jesse escapes. Guess what we already SPECULATED Jesse's escape and what really was important was what he did after he got away , the character's age difference was let's say noticable and the Jesse we knew was gone afterall Jesse Pinkman was a beloved character and El Camino was the farewell he deserved. Nothing special, but not bad either. 7 or 8 would be appropriate. Vince Gilligan had an idea of the branding his iconic characters long before MCU did. Cheers to his effort and story telling process. He gave a perfect farewell party for Jesse Pinkman. It's been really a long journey, and it's time to leave the old place to go to a new place to have something new, have a good life. If I'm being absolutely truthful, when Breaking Bad concluded six years ago, I never really had much thought of what was going to happen to Jesse. He rode off in the El Camino, and that was that. I figured he'd probably find a way to get out of New Mexico and maybe try and live some semblance of a less active and violent life. So when I first heard about a Breaking Bad movie about Jesse, minus Walt, I was a bit skeptical. However, knowing that I've pretty much loved everything that Vince Gilligan has done, I was hopeful. Well I watched El Camino tonight and I loved it. Aaron Paul gives as brilliant of a performance as he ever gave in Breaking Bad. And all of the characters that you'd want to see again, make an appearance (including Walt in a flashback). And there was one appearance that I wasn't expecting to see so much of. Jesse Plemons returns to play Todd, and unlike most of the other actors who return for what were basically cameos, Plemons' Todd makes more than just a cameo. In fact, he plays a pretty big role in some flashback scenes and we get to know him better. To me, Plemons was the pleasant surprise of the whole film. I knew I was going to be interested in Jesse's story. But I didn't expect to come to like Todd as much as I did. His role in this film is, sort of a microcosm example of the genius of Gilligan. Todd is disturbed. There is no doubt about that. But he also has some pretty tender moments (and yes, I can't believe I just wrote that) between he and Jesse. Todd is the only one who seems to want to interact with Jesse in more than just a kidnapper/abductee way. He's a sociopath. That's for sure. But Gilligan makes him a sympathetic sociopath. And yes, I know that that's a contradiction in terms. But Gilligan makes it work. And because he does, that seemingly contradiction actually paves the way for one of the most powerful scenes in the movie when Jesse makes a decision that would lead most abductors to go ballistic. Todd calmly deals with the situation, talks Jesse out of making what would have been a really bad decision, and even gives Jesse a pat on the shoulder when he needed it the most. Plemons' Todd also provides most of the comic relief in the film and he's subtly hilarious (the scene where he is driving had me busting a gut). There are also plenty of brutal scenes as well, as expected in an epilogue to one of the best, and also one of the most violent shows in the history of television. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I was glad to see that when it's all said and done, Jesse just might have a chance to start a new life (literally and figuratively). I highly recommend it to fans of BB, but also to others as well. My suggestion to someone who wants to watch it, but hasn't seen BB, is to watch BB. However, if you don't have time for that, then at least watch a few videos on youtube that summarize the most important aspects of Jesse's role in the series. There are several to choose from, and I promise you won't be disappointed. Compared to Breaking Bad, a 2. On it's own, a 7. So hard to rate.<br/><br/>As a fan of Breaking Bad who has binged that series in total at least 10 times over the years, I was severely disappointed in the movie but that's because you can't have Breaking Bad without Walter White. He was the character who "broke bad" after all, the show's namesake, and Jesse, the mere (but perfect) foil and sidekick. Together, magic.<br/><br/>Removing Walter from the mix is like trying to make chocolate cake without chocolate... and still calling it chocolate cake Imho it was a mistake to call this "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" - it should have been called, "El Camino: A Jesse Pinkman Movie." That would have set more accurate expectations as people would not have been expecting "Breaking Bad."<br/><br/>Because it wasn't just Walter missing. Breaking Bad had humor in nearly every scene, cleverly embedded by either something as simple as how ridiculous they looked in hazmat suits and gas masks, or Walter dealing with some screw-up of Jesse's, or family matters complicating things at just the wrong time. We could relate to the frustrations of the characters and that was funny to watch despite the heavy context. In El Camino there is no such humor. So the flavor of the show is completely unlike Breaking Bad, and anyone who hoped to recapture the feeling of BB will not find it in this movie.<br/><br/>This point was intensified because Jesse was severely traumatized by his ordeal, so he wasn't the same character (by necessity) as we had in BB. We don't laugh at his hair brained antics in the movie. Because that's not him anymore. So again... not the feeling or "hit" fans were expecting to get from "a Breaking Bad movie." And again why I think it was misnamed to its detriment.<br/><br/>Without Bryan Cranston (Walter White) there *is* no "Breaking Bad." There's only Jesse, half the magic, and not the strongest half. (Not referring to Aaron's acting but Walter White is the more compelling, intense character.) I do think "Jesse" could carry a series or subsequent movies, but let Jesse be his own spinoff of Pinkman movies or a series. Let "Breaking Bad" rest in peaceful perfection.<br/><br/>There is nothing like the duo that was Walter and Jesse, but no actor can create that alone. It ain't chocolate cake anymore. So call it what it is... and we will happily watch without comparing it to chocolate cake. I don't see what all the complaining is about. Vince Gilligan did a great job ending Jesse's story. No it's not visually action packed, but mentally it hits home. Jesse conquers some of his demons and does it his way. As a BB superfan I can say this is the movie I never knew I wanted. The series ended so perfectly and as a whole sets a precedent for how a series should be structured. It is amazing to be welcomed back into the world of these characters. I want so badly to rate this a 10 out of ten but realistically I feel as if adding Todd, so much Todd, was lazy filler. We could have been given so many more flashbacks with Jesse, why focus so much on Todd? Why not have Jesse visit Walt Jr for breakfast or show some talk with Hank? And No Gus Fring really took away from the experience especially since of all the characters he is the one I want them to dive into. Regardless, and I wont mention the actor playing Todd aging because we all do so let it go, the film is st fantastically written, acted, and the cinematography is pure art as always. Vince knocked it out of the park again, just wish Todd was the ball leaving the stadium. El Camino delivers exactly what I would want from it, it wraps up the loose ends that were left at the end of Breaking Bad particularly with Jesse's character, and provides a nice conclusion to his story while keeping Vince Gilligan's excellent style of directing and cinematography. I feel that some are disappointed because they expected a crazy movie full of twists and turns, but it's unreasonable to expect that as that would likely just ruin the ending to such a great series. El Camino provides a satisfying epilogue to Breaking with great acting from many of the characters we know and love. You've to keep in mind this is not another season of BB. It's just a closure for jesse pinkman. Don't expect all those twists and events of BB. They wanted to show what happened to pinkman and they did. A nice walk down the memory lane. It's a great movie for all BB fans, no questions about that. Didn't think it was too slow-paced as a lot of viewers complain. That they brought back lots of memories and actors from BB (and BCS) was a fitting and charming tribute to the whole BB series universe.<br/><br/>The actors were fabulous though I have to admit I was a little shocked too to see big Todd. This was the only thing disturbing to me that didn't fit, although some already mentioned, that in the timeframe it would have been possible for Todd to be that big during these shots. Otherwise just excellent, and definitely worth to watch. Also the western shootout wasn't too constructed if you think how this guy on coke felt towards his comrades, how he wanted to be seen by them after they heard that Jessie got 1/3 of the money - and now with no witnesses around and Jesses money in the car. It all makes sense how we know VG from BB.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film if you know BB. Don't know if there is a person on earth who hasn't seen BB, so it doesn't matter if El Camino works on its own - I'm not sure about that as it has so many easter eggs and flashbacks.<br/><br/>This is the end of the series - except maybe for Sauls way of going on after Felina in BCS, who knows? El Camino gives much needed closure to Jesse Pinkman, Walter White's partner who was originally slated to be killed by the end of the first season. However, the writers loved the dynamic relationship between the duo so much, that Jesse remained throughout all seasons.<br/><br/>So, how does Jesse fare in a movie he leads all by himself? Phenomenally. Given Jesse's volatile highs and lows throughout Breaking Bad, one would think the two hour movie would be a winding thriller. In contrast, El Camino features a Jesse defined by gravitas. Flashbacks of the past make appearances throughout the movie, and his more recent imprisonment by the Neo Nazis in the concrete well explains the serious, almost dark tone Jesse maintains throughout El Camino. Yet that doesn't mean Jesse loses semblance of his past self. Perhaps his most defining feature remains: moral conflict between right and wrong. Jesse Pinkman is still Jesse Pinkman but with a battle hardened character which makes him more apt to survive independently.<br/><br/>Some may wonder why Pinkman wasn't given his own series like Saul in Better Call Saul. However, Vince Gilligan did well in making the format of El Camino into a movie because it gives proper honor and homage to the character who likely suffered the most. Through cinema format, Vince Gilligan is better able to capture the intensity of Jesse and each scene is tactfully shot with meticulous attention to detail. The sagacious use of cinematography and lighting is something not found in Breaking Bad which gives a much appreciated rendition of Jesse Pinkman.<br/><br/>All in all, El Camino is a must see film worthy of viewing multiple times. It does not disappoint, and fans of Breaking Bad will be especially pleased with this important closure of Jesse Pinkman. Although it is about the same team (a part of it), the subject's approach is different. Those who still want Breaking Bad will risk being slightly disappointed. Otherwise, it's a movie to watch. If the question about Jesse's fate keeps you awake at night, this movie will give you closure.
Even though the series' ending is perfect on its own, the movie doesn't disappoint.
Calling it a masterpiece is a stretch, but it is definitely a brilliantly written, directed and acted movie. El Camino is ravishing, captivating in its every breath. A follow-up tale that keeps you strung on every beat as Jesse seeks freedom from the excess of his hell. I wouldn't say it's the movie you expect, lingering on flashbacks made simply to emphasize his pursuit, we get a main story that carries little weight to fulfill a full length feature film.<br/><br/>But they give us lots to chew up in between, and to me would've been more effective had Jesse orchestrated a setup in the climax, to not just attain his money, but make the police believe he is dead and the audience as well. (involving Badger and Skinny Peet more) As they search the El Camino for evidence, Jesse drives away in all his glory.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, the movie is still as highly engaging, nostalgic & rewatchable as it needs to be, the way only Vince Gilligan knows how to craft. Even though he could've made it so much more than it was, as a stand-alone movie, it's the type of experience i like & the kind of movie we don't see enough. Typical vince gilligan narration nothing extravagant but still it doesn't disappoint you. Apart from some unwanted flash backs and avoidable scenes it's a worthy watch if you are a Breaking Bad fan and want to find out what happened to jesse pinkman. It's not a blockbuster movie, but it works great as a final two part episode to cap off Jesse's story. Fat Todd was really off putting. Every other returning character was pretty well executed. I still can't believe they relied so much on fat Todd to move the story, but at the same time, what else could they have done? The full circle ending was underwhelming but overall pretty good. Fat Todd. Not give it too much expectation and you ' ll enjoy a well packed double episode Pinkman related. Fun. It was good to see some of the central protagonists of the Breaking Bad series including the infamous 'Walter White'. But overall it reminded me like a baseball 'old timer's day'. You know, the stars from the glory days get out on the field and play a bit to remind the fans of the glory days. However, with all due respect to all the players who knocked it out of the park and over the bleacher seats in the original series, the story here never gets out of the infield. The plot is built on overly-long flashbacks and additions to the original story. Worse, several flashbacks are long, boring and pointless.<br/><br/>A possible reason Breaking Bad spin-offs never have the same impact as the original might be because the original was so over-the-top superbly written and so exceptionally well performed from the very first moments of the pilot right down to the very last minutes of last episode.<br/><br/>As a fan who just had to watch the series more than once, and found it just as exciting the second time as seeing it for the first time, it pains me to say that "El Camino" strikes out. I don't see why people are starting to turn on this movie I thought was almost perfect with only some parts that dragged on like when Todd and Pinkman go get that body at his house and stuff I thought that could've Ben 20 minutes taken out of the movie and we diddint need it it diddint further the story and I just did not like it<br/><br/>Now in to the good stuff El Camino was not overhyped to me I thought is was going to be bad I had really low expectations of what this movie was going to be and diddint know what the story was gonna be but now that I've seen it I'm happy it was a part thriller part action and a bit of western movie it gives you a better ending for jessie after all we diddint really get a whole lot of him in season 5 of Breaking Bad so I feel him getting a fresh start in Alaska was pretty good and the movie makes you feel way worse for him he was not only in a cage they tortured him brutally and it makes Todd's death at the end of Felina way better and I don't get it Todd isn't that fat he is really not that different so stop bullying him Great film with a good ending for Jessy.
Enjoyed every second of the film. I'll be honest when I say, that I just recently finished watching Breaking bad. But give me a break, I'm seventeen and never had those channels on t.v. So I had to watch it on Netflix. But This doesn't change the fact the "Breaking bad" is in competition between my favorite t.v. Show of all time. My favorite drama thriller series. I was making predictions about them making a breaking bad movie years ago before I even watched the show, which is weird but I was always interested in the show. When I heard that El Camino was going to be released later this year I was excited. I wasn't really hooked on the name of it but I got a good vibe. I just finished watching this movie and man o man. This was fun to watch. Bringing back original characters and remembering the past. The overall story of the movie was awesome but I had some complaints. I think it could have been more of a "Breaking bad" episode made into a movie. With just so much suspense, and what the moments. Tho there is one in this movie. And no shame to Vince Gilligan, he is a master and will always be known for one of the greatest shows written to date. His visionary mind for making such film is outstanding. The one thing I think could have been a little different was Jesses fate. And like many other people, I'm sure we all didn't want him to die. And good thing because he doesn't. But I thought this could have been way more of a revenge story, maybe got talking more about Brock and the Neo Nazis. Instead the whole last act of the film was Jesse wasting 2 people and taking there money so he can have a new life. Just like the events of Walter white. Except... he died. So maybe Jesse did die but is left for you to think...??? Overall this movie was awesome and very fun to watch. Would not recommended for people that haven't watched the show yet. Actually, there is no ugly here. El Camino is perfectly fine and a nice send-off for Jessie Pinkman. The first hour of this film is pretty great. It feels like a natural progression of BB seeing Jessie on the run and his reunion with Badger and Skinny Pete. But once we get to the phony cops, things start to go south. The problem here is that all of the antagonists from BB are dead. New ones have to be created in order for the movie to have conflict beyond Jessie not getting caught by the law. It feels shoehorned in and not very honest.The showdown between Jessie and Kandy Welding is entertaining enough, but it feels like an excuse to bring some action to an otherwise straightforward story of getting the hell out of Dodge. Still, I enjoyed the film overall. It was nice to see old characters back in action and Jessie get a fresh start. Really disappointing if you have breaking bad as a reference... Even better call Saul have most epic scenes than El Camino... Yeah, we have an «ending» for Jessie, but that's all... They tried to give us a really flat fan service... And a really simple and predictible plot; Not a bad movie, but it definitely deserved more love... OK I know I will one of a few which does not like the ElCamino movie. AAron Paul did a great job, but the story and the storytelling were really boring. The two hours were a torture of hope that the movie will get better. Sorry Vince Gilligan you did better stories. Although it's, on the face of it, a better film than either, this makes me think of Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. Why does it exist, other than the obvious commercial reasons? We're in an era of the storytelling 'universe', where everything that can be known about a character or story must be known. Hence those Alien movies - utterly unnecessary, and compromising the essential 'inexplicable terror' of the original films.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul is good in this because Aaron Paul us a good actor; but it's odd to return to immediately where the show left off when he's aged so much since. And it shows, however good the performance.<br/><br/>You see, a lot of time has passed since this was a fresh show - and though it's original brilliance is undimmed, there's some things that we can't allow now. We can't allow 30 minutes of a film to pass before a female character is seen or heard (and then she's a dead body); there's scarcely a female voice heard all film. There's no good narrative reason for that. In 2019, film-makers have to do better than that.<br/><br/>The plot is aimless, but that was always part of the show's attraction, a kind of tone of surrealist solemnity, punctured by comedy and violence. It's not a bad film; it's just an unnecessary one. Little disappointed to be honest, but nice to know what happened to Jesse after Breaking bad. Breaking Bad fans will enjoy this but it's not life changing Was it necessary to make this film? No. Was it worth making? Absolutely!
It was great to see the Breaking Bad cast on screen again; giving us an insight to what happened after Jesse escaped from Uncle Jack.
If you're a fan of Breaking Bad you'll love it, although, it's probably wasted on the people that have never watched the series.
I was skeptical going into the film as I heard many people saying bad things, however, after seeing it, I can't think why?
Probably just reviews from people that had never watched the series and were expecting something that this film wasn't trying to deliver.
It's simply an addition to the series; a lengthy, belated, extra episode if you will.
I thoroughly enjoyed it. Kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole time.
If you loved the series, I'd say its a must watch to give you some closure for Aaron Paul's character: Jesse Pinkman. Breaking bad was an amazing series from beginning to end, and one of the things that made it amazing was how perfect the ending was. It had a magnificent feeling of finality. After which you felt there was just nothing more to say.<br/><br/>So of course they made a sequel.<br/><br/>This movie answers the question I haven't thought about since the series ended; what happened to Jesse. It's an episodic story in which Jesse crosses paths with old friends and new enemies as he struggles to find an exit to his messed-up life.<br/><br/>Some of it's pretty interesting, particularly the Jesse Plemons flashback scenes and those surrounding them. Still, much of it feels random, particularly the shoehorned-in cameos of BB regulars that are pure fan service.<br/><br/>It's well made. It's well acted. Most of the individual scenes are pretty good. It's also somewhat disjointed and completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Now that I've described it I'm wondering why I give it a 7 instead of a 6. Perhaps emotional attachment to the series? I won't recommend watching it, but I won't recommend not watching it. Just don't expect something as good as BB or the Better Call Saul sequel. It's not even close. It seems to me is what they were trying to do here was almost a redemption arc for Jesse and I did enjoy much of the film. However ultimately it's a film that makes no real difference in the grand scheme of things and while I would watch through Breaking Bad again in a heartbeat, I can't see me taking the effort to deliberately watch this again A rather lackluster end to the story of Jesse Pinkman. Of course it was never going to have as climactic events as the series but there was hardly any suspense. Extra scenes with Walter and Jane didn't really have any purpose other than to create a nostalgic scene with the characters. It would have been great to see them cook one last time. It felt like it was too easy for Jesse to get away. A police chase scene would have been good and every person seemed to not recognise him even though it's been all over the news. Either way, this is a nice end for Jesse. However, it was dragged out way too long over 2 hours when nothing really happened. It was interesting seeing Jesse's story wrapped up, but seems rather pointless and too little too late. Aaron Paul is visibly much older, so the flashback scenes to the times of Breaking Bad are kind of amusing, especially with Walter. I don't remember Jesse Plemons being that big. What I'm saying is that we've all moved on, and dragging these actors back into storylines that are over and done with is kind of like putting on clothes from ten years ago: you're only going to be disappointed. The only bright spots are seeing Bryan Cranston and Robert Forster again, bringing a much-needed grounding to their scenes. I think the main problem with this film is that they're compressing dramatic scenes that you would normally see over the course of a season into two hours and it doesn't work, it seems, well, squished. In the show, we got to know these characters over the span of years, but to see them in untethered snippets is kind of like eating a candy bar for dinner. God,Todd is so fat.After I watched the movie,what remind me most is that,Todd is so fat.Why he didn't lose some weight before the movie filming. Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows ever made. Perhaps it is a bit boring in some episodes, but overall it is fantastic. Sadly, El Camino is not as fantastic as it could be. In my opinion, you can call it a nice addition to the show. The film seemed a little bit empty. Be aware, you will not experience a great written story as in BB, but it is not bad or average either. It is a good movie, but not a great one! The acting auf Aaron Paul is authentic and the best thing about this movie. It is what really gives you the Breaking Bad vibe.. I recommend the film for people who enjoyed the series and want to watch some more footage of the Breaking Bad Universe, but you definitely do not have to! Having Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and El Camino in mind, I would rate them from best to worse as listed. I enjoyed watching it. It is a direct sequel to the end of the Breaking bad serie, but exclusively from Pinkman's perspective. It isn't a brilliant movie, but it is the best as it could be, and maybe can be best watched as two extra episodes from the original serie.<br/><br/>Everything is decent: there are the same characters, pacing, photography, soundtrack, dialogues, etc. The flashback scenes were very well made and looks like exactly like the serie eras. Also, if you watch it with attention you can get a bunch of easter eggs.<br/><br/>It is a good closure to Jesse's story. Breaking bad was no doubt a MASTERPIECE, I mean no doubt one of the best series to ever be made in TV HISTORY. I was expecting a little more from El Camino since very little info has ever been giving about the movie which kept everyone even more excited for this. I just didn't understand this to much, I mean the whole memory lane thing with Todd and how they were together and Jesse didn't kill him? I mean if you seen the show and everything Jessie went through he would of no question asked killed Todd soon as an opportunity presented it self I mean just look at the season finale!
Guess I was just expecting little more. A very average movie, but in the scheme of BB it's a disappointment. I know other reviewers said some of were expecting too much. I was expecting at least some tension, some Breaking Bad character action. It was fine, glad I watched it...but meh. Not much there. It was a great disappointment when Breaking Bad (the series) ended so a movie about what happened after that was a good idea. To know what became of Jesse Pinkman is something all Breaking Bad fans are keen to know but the movie is just not as good as the series. Still good acting from Aaron Paul and all the others but that special suspense from the series was just not present in El Camino. That aside it's still worth a watch, a nice closure to one of the best series from the last years. It just wasn't needed. I gave it a 6 purely out if my respect for Breaking Bad. It was great seeing the characters interact with each other again but the storyline was meh. I liked Jesse in BB but not that much to watch him try and find some money to get a new identity. I honestly thought there'd be more to it. Unfortunate. Loved the show.. although different from GOT I thought it was a better show from start to finish.<br/><br/>The movie however is a bit of a let down.. although the world here is very true to the show, the vast difference in character appearance since season 5 is really hard to ignore.<br/><br/>6 years is a long time, but not that long... everybody's gotten fat and really old and takes away a lot of the credibility factor.. it's hard to look at Todd and pretend that was a flashback.<br/><br/>All in all the movie didn't add much and I was satisfied with Jessie's ending had in breaking bad, And this ending was more or the same.. it felt however more like a bonus episode with the now older cast trying to fit into their old roles that it takes away from the masterpiece that the show is. We all wanted to know what happened to Jesse now we know
you can not expect it to as good as breaking bad when almost the whole
cast was killed off.
I am happy to know were Jesse is -good finish to the show Movie was alright, i was waiting for more action. But i guess the story was good I think the major problem with this movie is the fact that they waited so long after the ending of BB. It's nice to see the outcome of Jesse's story, but it really shows in the actor's ages / faces and it doesn't fit the actual timeline. I sort of went into this not expecting a full on BB episode, but I wasn't let down either. There are some good action scenes, and of course, we all got to see skinny pete and Badger back again. It's too bad that they don't spin off a series with just those three. I must admit I've been chomping at the bit for the next season of "Better Call Saul" so that I can continue my delightful foray into Vince Gilligan's great writing, colorful characters and imaginative yet relatable world. El Camino seemed like an apt appetizer to stave off that hunger which I must admit has been panging now for the better part of two years (news flash: no ones getting any younger). Instead of the satisfaction I was longing for I found myself stumbling through the dilapidated ruins of a once great show, with a crudely overweight Todd, who now appears with a swollen, puffy face and a hard to miss beer belly that peers out from his jacket. Sure his disconnected almost naive brutality always served as a convenient antagonist of the show but in this particular closing peace feels stale and almost forced. Of course we are graced with a peppering of some of the old characters we have loved from the original show, some more familiar than others however their ultimate contribution falls flat as insignificant and inconsequential. The movie doesn't really leave you with a sense of closure, it feels like merely an drawn out extension of the show with some glaring plot issues that seem to fester over the course of the movie. And although we get to sit shotgun as Jesse attempts to escape the chaotic mess Walt left behind, the stakes never really reach the level Breaking Bad did. If you enjoyed BB it's gonna be hard not to wanna watch this but as a stand-alone piece it feels like a bit of a nostalgic after thought. Don't get me wrong, the performances aren't bad and they support the movie as best they can, I just found that by the end I didn't care much about how we got there or that it was in fact the end of a great show, I suppose it made me feel like it was all just a little unnecessary, would have preferred another season of BCS over this minor detour. A huge fan of Breaking Bad and got on the band wagon way later. So being able to see El Camino close to me actually finishing the series just made me think they just added like 2 more episodes to series. I think everyone wanted to see what happened to Pinkman and this sums it up. I don't mind having extra episode like this. Actually it might be interesting to get a standalone movie about every support character and create some sort of miniseries<br/><br/>El Camino went with combination of flashbacks and additional story line "how Jesse got out", but I think it didn't brought anything new to the series. And actually I liked the BB ending very much, Jesse riding to the sunset (in a night). It was a little bit too straight forward. From a movie, I expect more. In series, i get that we get first part to initiate the story and the grand finale with bunch of fillers inbetween and we judge the quality of the series how impactfull the fillers are. BB had a good run. El Camino went with the skip of fillers, glued the beginning and end together and released it as a movie. I'm glad they made a movie after the ending of the series left you short, it was a good cook and sound performance from Aaron Paul.<br/><br/>RIP robert forster that passed away the other day and this being his last film. The highly anticipated and somewhat unexpected follow up to TV phenomenon Breaking Bad is upon us. I say unexpected because I honestly thought the idea of making a Breaking Bad movie was a joke. It seemed unnecessary, especially since Breaking Bad had a decent and strong finale. Personally I felt the show ended a bit too conveniently, but it's better than most finales on TV. Not to mention the excellent prequel series Better Call Saul, which I believe is superior to Breaking Bad in every way. So the Breaking Bad universe is alive and strong, but this film for me was, again, totally unnecessary. The plot of the film is basically the conclusion to Jesse's arc for those that can't use their imagination. I'm not sure how fans of the series feel about this movie, I'm sure many will love it. I will say that I'm definitely in the minority when I say that Jesse wasn't the reason I was fully invested in Breaking Bad. His character was a great counter balance to Walter White, he was a solid supporting character, but not much else in my opinion. I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, hell I didn't even know this film was a sure thing until the trailer dropped a couple days ago. My negatives with the film is the pacing and the way the film is structured. I expected flashbacks, but goddamn, this movie has too many, and it really halts the pacing. Why dedicate a majority of the runtime to Jesse hanging out with fat Todd, not to mention a tact on and cheesy cameo from Bryan Cranston wearing a bald cap. That's another problem that contributes to the flashbacks, many of the actors don't look as well as they did six years ago, and I understand that these characters are integral to Jesse's storyline, but I found some of them to be highly distracting and it took me out of the movie. The scenes with Todd are supposed to be intense since he's a morally ambiguous character, but I couldn't take him seriously at all. My main criticism is that this film doesn't stand on its own two feet. What makes Better Call Saul brilliant is that it's able to stand in its own and not rely on Breaking Bad to tell a compelling narrative. You can watch Better Call Saul without watching Breaking Bad and still enjoy it. This film is the opposite, and it feels like a cash grab. I will say that the performances, specifically from Aaron Paul and Robert Forster are terrific. The cinematography is fantastic, the movie looks great, and there is a highlight in the movie involving a fridge full of money that was actually tense. Beyond that, this feels like a fan-made film, and it's a shame they would postpone Better Call Saul for this. Either way, if you want to see the 2 hour epilogue for Breaking Bad, this is it, but for me, it didnt work and it felt unnecessary. If I ever find myself watching Breaking Bad again, I won't be watching this film. This is definitely worth watching if you're a Breaking Bad fan (like you weren't going to watch it anyway) but it feels like more of an extended episode than anything else.<br/><br/>This story could really have done with being drawn out a bit more, perhaps as a mini series, rather than a one-off movie. What's there is good and I was entertained the whole way through, but there was potential to expand on this story and the various characters introduced throughout. I believe this would have made the pay off more impactful.<br/><br/>That being said, El Camino was a solid evening's entertainment, and it was nice to see Jesse's story get some closure. El Camino is a great addition to the Breaking Bad saga. It feels just like another BB episode which is big compliment in itself. Direction and acting is top notch in this one. Cameos by the series actors are very well placed and makes you smile. Overall a must watch for the series fans. I mostly enjoyed the movie and it's worth the watch for Breaking Bad fans. It's nostalgic. The movie is mostly just flashbacks and popular character cameos. It probably could've just been two bonus episodes of BB. I will say I expected more from it and I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters.<br/><br/>During the scene with Walt and Jesse at the diner, I was disappointed when I saw there was only 13 minutes left in the movie. That told me that nothing else exciting was going to happen. And that pretty much rang true. It felt like the entire movie was one long slow burn. There wasn't really a climax.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece and it wasn't essential. But I enjoyed it. It didn't ruin anything about the original series and they didn't have Jesse go be a lumber jack in the Pacific Northwest so those are both wins in of themselves. Sick of reading "wheres the twists" . " theres no action "
The director has not sold this movie on nothing else but an ending to jesses story. Breaking bad provided us with the twists already this was wrapping up questions and i think it done it rather well! It was intense, witty and the film actually captured the feel of breaking bad which could have easily been lost and could have felt like a detached film.<br/><br/>Only reason i given 8/10 was that nothing can beat the series I feel Vince's aim of El Camino was never to surpass the superiority of the Breaking Bad series, but to provide a deserved ending for Jesse Pinkman.<br/><br/>If you sit down to watch El Camino expecting a fantastic film with constant action and thrill, then you will be disappointed. The film is exactly like BrBa; slow, tension building with superb cinematography. It's not great, but it does provide the BrBa fans and community with a proper ending for Jesse Pinkman, one that he has deserved over the full series.<br/><br/>I'm never going to rewatch the movie, I've certainly seen better things over two hours, but I have to admit it's a movie I needed. If you feel like you needed to see an ending to Jesse Pinkman and you needed a reminder of the superiority of the Breaking Bad series (especially as Better Call Saul has been pushed back to 2020), then you will enjoy El Camino.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie isn't one of the greats, but for the two hours watching it I did enjoy it. And, if I'm honest, I think you will do too. BREAKING BAD is my favourite show of all time, and BETTER CALL SAUL is the greatest spinoff known to mankind, so hearing a movie being made about Jesse did make me excited, but still cautious. And now that I have seen it, I can wholeheartedly say, EL CAMINO: A BREAKING BAD MOVIE is a thrilling event from start to finish. Vince Gilligan once again knocks it out of the park, with a gripping story, entertaining characters and unexpected twists and turns that are truly satisfying, as is the conclusion to Jesse's story. After rewatching the entire show two times and then seeing this movie, I found myself so moved, so heartbroken yet feeling optimistic about Jesse and his future, who's a man that has gone through a lot, from losing his house and lovers, to later being kept prisoner, forced to cook meth.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul does an incredible job as Jesse as he did years ago. This time around Jesse isn't the energetic, talkative character we've come to know, but now he's a mature, broken down man who is doing everything in his power to find peace in life, but life just keeps beating him down.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie, however, are the flashbacks scenes. Throughout EL CAMINO we get large chunks of scenes during the events of BREAKING BAD never seen before, and the actors try portraying these characters they played so many years ago and try to look young as they did in the show, but they have clearly aged and the makeup job (if even any) don't help. But it is a mistake that is bound to happen and you cannot really do much about it, so I can look past that.<br/><br/>Overall, EL CAMINO is an excellent conclusion to Jesse Pinkman's story that touches the heartstrings and enthrals us. And in the end, we hope Jesse truly lives the rest of his life happily. I did really enjoy it, but just didn't think it was necessary. The series ended in a way that left Jesse's demise up to the imagination of the viewer, and this movie just wasn't needed. In saying that, it was executed to perfection. This film is for the Breaking Bad fan that has been going through withdrawal since the series ended and needed just one more quick hit. It delivered with action and suspense. It placed Jesse in a few predicaments so we could cheer for him to succeed. It gave us a few glimpses of some of our favorite characters from the show. We got to see how Jesse's character has grown and evolved through his entire ordeal. Most of all we get some closure for his character. Through his conversations with Mike, Walt and Jane, we can get a clue to his direction in life even after this film. It was a very satisfying 2 hours. Unfortunately with El Camino the expectations were too high. Instead of taking it to another level Gilligan decide to take it down a notch.<br/><br/>The twists and turns of BB were not in this storyline. Not even close and you probably can't expect that from a movie versus episodic narratives. But the flashback waste of screen time is what has made people feel the effort is not worth the watch.<br/><br/>Flashbacks only work if they move story forward. In some cases it did, but as the screen time progressed you begin to wonder where this is all going. Really, the task is to simply get enough money to change his identity?<br/><br/>Nobody wanted to see Jesse cook again. What they wanted was to see him find the family he always wanted. In the end you are left empty and wondering what was it all for. That was really why people have spoken negatively about this movie. It's pretty much a pointless story when the opportunity for Jesse to find what he really wanted was ripe for the taking, but they decided to be more sublime. By the end of Breaking Bad I HATED Walter. Of course this wasn't always the case but poisoning Brock really put my positive feelings for the character into question and then season 5... hiring Todd, Killing Mike, getting Jesse captured and ultimately being responsible for Hank's death. I could no longer support him. He was a villain. And not in the 'you're bad but I understand why you did this' way. He was straight up evil. So my crutch to lean on as I began to fall out of love was Jesse, an always loveable and ever growing character and I found his ending in the last few episodes of BB disappointing honestly. I love those last few episodes as we get to see Walt try and right the wrongs of his past and meet his comeuppance but my crutch, Jesse, just drove off into the night, and of course some people may see this as a happy ending to the character, him getting his freedom after months of imprisonment, but I knew that it wasn't as cut and dry as that. The PTSD, the federal government, Jesse's struggles were far from over and this in my mind was the ending I wanted. This movie could of so easily been a gratuitously action packed Breaking Bad nostalgia fest and it wasn't. We get a story that is more than worth telling with flashbacks which help add depth to the character and the show as a whole while also working in tandem with the present day scenes. The cinematography was incredible, best in Breaking Bad's long history and that's no small feat... music was just classic Gilligan which is by no means a bad thing and the character work here is wonderful. We see the most damaged version of Jesse yet, he's got something to live for now in his freedom but he doesn't quite realise that and that makes him a dangerous man. Skinny Pete was given some very touching scenes in the first third that really help give his character more depth. Also I need to bring up one of my favourite scenes in recent years and that's the Mexican standoff at the end. This scene was so well built up and so satisfying and the fact that it's the only isolated act of real violence in the whole film makes it even more so. Honestly I don't have much to complain about here. Seeing Jesse drive calmly off into the vastness of Alaska like he had imagined since season 5, at peace with his past and cutting all ties to that life, good or bad, was everything I wanted for the character and I have been left feeling a little more whole than I was before watching this. I'm gonna give El Camino a 9.7 as an episode of Breaking Bad and an 8.5 as it's own movie bringing it roughly to an average of 8.9/10. This is MY ending to Breaking Bad. Thank you for reading and have a lovely day, night and life. MINOR Spoilers: I understand the amount of 10/10s this movie is getting - the adoration and following for Breaking Bad is almost unparalleled, and I count myself among one of its biggest fans. However, I think that love for the parent show has caused many viewers to see this movie through rose tinted glasses. It was... fine. It was nice to return to ABQ and the Gilliganverse, and fun seeing some old characters. However, anybody with any common sense would always know how Jesse's story was going to end. Unfortunately, that means creating a whole two hour movie to manoeuvre us to that end game, and, honestly, there's very little in the way of plot here. As fan service and as a love letter to BB diehards, the movie is quite lovely, and the final scene undoubtedly offers a sense of closure. But as a movie in its own right, it struggles to justify itself enormously. I would estimate that 40 - 50% of the movie is made up of flashbacks, which are a perfectly fine (if - a little tacky?) way to revisit long lost characters. But the need to invest such a large portion of the movie in the past suggests that there just isn't enough story to tell. The scenes that do take place in the present are better, and (as always) beautifully shot, directed, and acted. But each scene seems to linger on for just a little bit too long, giving the impression of stalling until we see the inevitable conclusion. The creation of a brand new set of never-before-seen antagonists from Jesse's past to create some semblance of conflict (including the film's first, last and VERY polarising action scene) seems only to exist to pad out the film's midsection, which begs the question of why the movie is so long at all if there is not enough original content to fill it. I realise I'm focusing entirely on the negatives here, and that is largely because Breaking Bad has doctored me to expect nothing but the best from anything Vince Gilligan touches. This, unfortunately, is his first real mis-step. I'm glad I watched it, and can appreciate all that was good about it. But I doubt I will have any desire to watch it again. *WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS TO THE ORIGINAL BREAKING BAD SERIES!*<br/><br/>Like almost every other "Breaking Bad" fan out there, I was very worried when I heard that they were making a film about what happened after the original series, which, as you already know, is fantastic. I was of course more assured when I found out that it was going to be directed by the same mastermind, Vince Gilligan, who made the original series, and that it would be starring it's previous actors, such as Aaron Paul, Charles Baker, Jesse Plemons and Matt Jones. But still, I was nervous, since "Breaking Bad" has what a lot of people, including me, consider to be a perfect ending. And after watching "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie", I feel...somewhat unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that this movie is a lot longer than it could've been. A lot of scenes feel rather slow and some of them even feel a bit pointless. There are a lot of flashbacks to what happened when Jesse was held hostage by Jack's gang, and honestly I really don't care about that that much, I wanted to see more of what happened to Jesse after Walt's death and I didn't get enough of that. And that's a reason why I only feel "somewhat satisfied" with this movie after watching it. But the climax (the last 30 minutes or so) was awesome and full of tension, and it is what prevents me from giving this movie a lower rating.<br/><br/>Also, this might sound weird, but this movie didn't really feel like "A Breaking Bad Movie". There was something off about it, maybe it was the cinematography, since it's not the same director of cinematography who...directed the cinematography. Or maybe it's the characters, Skinny Pete and Badger don't really feel like the same people to me in this movie anymore. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something that made me feel a tad uneasy while watching the movie.<br/><br/>This movie did wrap up well, but was the whole thing really necessary? My answer is no, not really. But I'm not unhappy that it was made, I just wish some things were done differently. And if you're wondering, no this movie does not ruin the original "Breaking Bad" series for you, not at all. Film was pretty good overall and a nice sendoff for Jesse. But oh my god, could they not CGI Todd to look like he used to?<br/><br/>The fact that Todd was twice the size and five times the age he used to be completely ruined the illusion of this being set right after Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Apart from this pretty major fault, the movie was, as I said, pretty good. Not up to Breaking Bad standards in my opinion though. It was a nice complementary film. They've covered Jesse's gap well in the show with flashbacks. The escape theme was also quite successful. You feel the seriousness of this. I just found Todd in the movie, old and overweight. Todd wasn't on the show. It is a sequel that must be followed by those who love the series.<br/><br/>⭐ 100/74 Nostalgic and some parts are good but most of the parts are really bad. Not even close to the Breaking Bad. I wasn't expected too long story but the storyline has so logicless things. Okey all I can say it is watchable. I expected a fast paced manhunt but instead got a slow paced and very satifying end of Jesse's story. Sure he killed a couple of people in this movie, but they sure had it coming. This in sharp contrast to Todd, who kills his cleaning lady because she asked questions about his money. Nice to see some familiar faces to round things up. The expectations for this movie were skyhigh and it totally lives up to it. So you see B&W, there are ways to round up a great series! They made a great show but they should have left it at that. Slow moving without a purpose or reason for making it Well, it's Breaking Bad. So we knew this was going to be great. If you want to remember feeling of watching BB series you must watch this film, Vince did it again. I am a fan of Breaking Bad. This "piece of art" is pure nonsense, with the story "sucked out of a thumb". It adds nothing to the original story, and is completely artificial. Wild West thing at the showdown between Jesse and some crooks? Come on, no imagination here, completely unbelievable. The makers must be ashamed of themselves - there is no compassion for anyone in this flick, it is as boring as a B-movie can be. Are we supposed to care for any characters here? Well, I did not. Hardly finished watching. Shame.... Waste of time! No plot...dumb and dumber dialogue...some parts didn't make sense...Fat Tod, Old Walt again...bunch of Netflix desperation...but I loved the original BB series. It just didn't cut it for me...Sorry fans.. I only recently watched breaking bad, and when i heard they were making a movie, i was all for it. El camino is a perfect sequel to breaking bad, it wraps up the story for jesse, and in my opinion, doesn't need a part 2, its perfect, and must stay that way. Ok so it's about Jesse but they didn't explain ALOT and we didn't see much so im not sure what the point of this was just drag along the story for more money ???? Because the Breaking Bad & Better Call Saul franchise is booming ? A slow story about a shi!bird. I loved breaking bad but couldn't finish this. All this rebooted stuff is usually lame. Producers just trying to squeeze a buck outta something that was originally awesome Mixed feelings about this one. I'm a great fan of the original series so I appreciate the great acting as usual (Jesse is amazing), also filming style and good to see the old Breaking Bad characters one more time.
On the other hand the movie is extremely slow, boring and closer to Better Call Saul style than Breaking Bad. I think here is the big handicap, the pace is not adequate.
Last, It does not add anything relevant about the characters or story. So, why to make a Breaking Bad movie?
Overall, a missed opportunity to complete a masterpiece series called Breaking Bad. I'll be honest up front: Im not the biggest breaking bad fan in the world. The final series was incredible, hut the rest could have been wrapped up into two seasons before it.<br/><br/>El camino is pointless. Its need to be created feeds into the spoon-fed culture that is now becoming of the western world.<br/><br/>Lets go back years, to the wnd of the Soprano's, and open ending that allowed us as viewers to think, be creative and add conjecture to the future of the family. The greatest ending to a series ever written.<br/><br/>Fast forward however many years its been. Breaking Bad appears and is ok as a series. Not great, its slow and boring for the majority of it, but then explodes into the unforgettable, almighty moments. It ends with us, the viewers, knowing Jesse is on the run, wishing he had left this life with the many opportunities he had.<br/><br/>We also know thats his jext plan - lets face it, we know.<br/><br/>What does el camino bring to that?<br/><br/>The exact same thing we knew without being bored and questioning why we ever liked Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman in the first place.<br/><br/>Pointless, it brings nothing to a decent franchise.<br/><br/>Also, they could have done better work with Jesse Plemons, the flashbacks showed him as a very different character to what we saw in the series.<br/><br/>Disappointing, a waste of time. Let me start saying that i did like to see Jesse and all of the characters that made BB what it was. The acting was nice, nothing spectacular though.
I feel that this was more like an ending to Jesse story rather than a Breaking Bad closure as a whole.
I'm used to slow-paced stories, and don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, but it was extremely slow and stretched to the point of wanting it to end already.<br/><br/>To sum it all up:<br/><br/><ul><li>Good slow-paced story about Jesse trying to scape from his past.</li><li>A couple of good suspenseful scenes.</li><li>Not Breaking Bad at all, besides some of the original characters trying to make it feel like it was.</li></ul> If the orginal breaking bad series ended with a conclusion to Walter White's story, this movie ends Jessie Pinkman's story. The movie plays out like a 2 hour long episode, not losing any of the charm that made the original series so good. Aaron Paul (expectedly) gives a thrilling performance that makes you glued to the screen with you feeling everything his character is doing at the moment. If you watched the original series, you can not say you finished it until you watch this movie. El Camino is a very entertaining ending to the Breaking Bad story that a lot of people have been wondering about for years. What happened to Pinkman?<br/><br/>The acting and writing in this movie is brilliant, it feels and looks just like a Breaking Bad episode. Aaron Paul again shows us how much of a brilliant actor that he is. I also loved the flashback parts of the movie, bringing us back to the moments when Breaking Bad was spoken about by everyone, and I felt like I was watching the show once again. I do have some issues with the movie, and these are really bad issues, since the movie doesn't have any problems. I thought it was a little slow, mainly in the first hour or so. After that it picked up, and we got some very intense scenes. The cinematography, the soundtrack are both perfect, and they really add to some edge-of-the-seat moments. There are also very emotional parts to the story here, showing us brief snippets of Jesse's torment. These scenes really brought out the horror that we rarely got to seee during season 5.<br/><br/>El Camino is a great movie, that ends the show perfectly. It would have been a 6 for me, because of how slow it was. But I give it a 8.4/10, mainly because of that scene towards the end.....If you have seen it, you know what scene I mean. Smiled from ear to ear. It was a nice close to the Jesse story. It was good to see what I pictured in my mind all these years, but some things didn't make sense. 1. The police were tracking Todd's stolen El Camino, but how did they know it was gone? There was nothing or no one telling them that the car was ever even there. Plus, it was pretty convenient that they started tracking it RIGHT when Joe was checking for trackers. 2. Never in a million years would Todd say
the words, "Don't make me feel worse than I already do." 3. The wild west "draw" scene was just plain stupid. Jesse didn't know that Neil had the .45 until he showed him. Neil could've said, "Fine, $1,800...not a penny more" then pulled his gun when he got close to Jesse. Draw and winner takes all?...just dumb. It just didn't feel like Breaking Bad caliber writing. I would still recommend it, it just let me down a little. Do you know what fans do? They rewatch, research, analyze, theorize, study characters,cinematography, direction, script, soundtrack... you get the picture. So believe me when I as a fan say that this movie is not Breaking Bad, it lacks everything that made the series. That it sucks. This is not hate, this is an honest opinion. A single episode story stretched to 2 hours. It's not bad and not boring but really adds nothing new and serves more as a vehicle to show some of the series' old characters, some of them for single scenes. If you're a big "Breaking Bad" fan, I guess you'll like it. And the legend of BB continues. Unabated. Jesse is <3. God I waited for this movie! Breaking Bad has affected me like no other show (OR film for that matter) and made me an obsessive fan of the show and most of all of it's male leads. And I honestly think it is Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's collaboration that made the show the legend and icon that it is. So we have this sequel with Aaron Paul giving his most intensive performance as Jesse, but without Cranston's Walt to balance him it's just daunting to watch. The movie itself felt pointless and boring and time to time didn't even make sense. Reading all these raving reviews about this 'master piece' just baffles me. Am I missing something? A lovely perfect end for the best Character that is ever created in the history of the TV Shows.
Some nostalgic scenes and dialogues will surely be loved by the fans.
Vince Gilligan's love letter to Pinkman.
This is So Satisfying
Breaking Bad did it again Stop with the 1/10 reviews Jesus. Literally if you didn't like it a 4/10 or 5/10 is understandable. But a 1??? No, Vince Gilligan wrote the HECK out of this script, he delivered everything a movie is supposed to and more. A plot, interesting characters and a script to work with. I feel like EVERYONE is mad because it's just solid and they want 99% crystal pure season 5 style show since the ending was so good they expected the film to be as good. It's not going to happen man. I'd actually agree with you and say compared to season 5 this movie is barely even a 6/10 but if you JUDGE the film for what a film is it's not bad. It's a 7/10 at best to be honest. Jessie holds this film high with his performance, the tension is beautifully written by Vince and it's overall a great film, stop the crap reviews and 1/10 spams it's not a bad film. I loved Breaking Bad and it was also slow paced. However El Camino reminded me of Better Call Saul. It was like watching paint dry. Complete waste of time.
During the first 60 minutes I was waiting and waiting for the actual point of the movie. For something to happen. A plot twist or a bigger scheme..... I'm still waiting.
The movie was also full of strange moves.
One example, for a measily 1.800 dollar, Jesse decides to do a Western standoff. He could also just asked his parent, instead of Breaking into their home for straling 2 pistols. Breaking Bad was a great show. It took its time with episodes, but got there in the end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie is everything bad about Breaking Bad, in a movie length format. Full of unconvincing and, in most cases, unnecessary flashbacks (where many characters are suddenly much fatter than they used to be), with zero attention to pacing, and virtually nothing new revealed or attained.<br/><br/>Its beyond slow. While long shots of people eating at diners while talking are fine in a series, where they are providing plot exposition, when its really just a recap, and we've already sat through these diner sequences already, it really drags a lot.<br/><br/>Make up your own mind, but certainly don't believe all the fanboys (who probably would upvote anything). This is about as good as a very weak BB episode at best. Sorry Vince but for me this was just lazy & frankly rather pointless! I wanted to see Jesse's next chapter NOT watch a ridiculously ballooned up Todd's past treatment of Pinkman for most of the film! After Jesse fleas to Pete & Badger it should of gone straight to his escape and journey to his new venture into Alaska!
I'm pretty sure most true fans would agree!
Forget the past for any future films and move on to the next chapter. I've watch all of BB 7+ times but will not watch El Camino again. Sorry I had great expectations, as all Breaking Bad fans, and I'm very disappointed.
There's no attention at all for important details. The flashback with a 20 kg oversized Todd, for example, is simply ridiculous: Netflix could have put him on a diet a couple of weeks before starting the production.
Honestly, I could live also without it. This whole film could have been some much better. A basic round up of what happened to Jessie. Would have been better leaving this alone 10/10 because<br/><br/>... this is addressed at people having watched BB and mostly BCS<br/><br/>... for these, this movie is gold. It collects lose ends and makes them meet in a very peaceful but not too forgiving way<br/><br/>Its purpose is finding a satisfactory end to this character as it was for White/Heisenberg. It explains a lot. It makes peace. It's a very satisfactory experience.<br/><br/>Thank you to all involved!<br/><br/>PS: Haven't watched either show? Not your movie. Incredible movie, my only (very minor) complaint was that they accidently hired Fat Damon instead of Meth Damon. The beloved Jesse Pinkman, once again beautifully played by Aaron Paul. The character is different, clearly suffering from PTSD and Aaron does it in a Oscar worthy way. Vince Gilligan as the director fits perfectly as it's his baby and his script, the mastermind is back with a sequel to Breaking Bad and he doesn't let down in the visual story telling, writing and dialogue. It's a worthy sequel to the ultimate masterpiece of Breaking Bad. I really like how they are using the same exact editing and montage, it's a great way of story telling which Vince shows here that it works in movies as well and not just TV shows. There were a lot of characters from the show in this movie and they were all there for good reasons and not to just put them there, each one of them served a purpose even the ones that are dead that came back through flashbacks.<br/><br/>This was actually a really great movie outside of me being a huge Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fan, it still holds up as a fantastic movie and a spectacular cinematic experience. There were too many flashbacks but if you think about it in a different way, they were needed as they show us what really happened with Jesse at Jack's Compound and the other flashbacks was perfect. The overall story was as expected, following Jesse the minute he got out of the compound to the end of his journey, but in a way opens up new possibilities but it's probably his ending and it was beautiful. Glad to know how Jesse's escape took place. Got some extra "could use" information but it was by no means "need to know" information. The movie was a tad too slow, and by slow I mean time filler and fluff. The whole thing could have been shortened and not skipped a beat. Or they could have added in some more valuable content and keep the longer running time.<br/><br/>Did I enjoy it? Yeah it was a decent flick. Did I need it? Nah could have lived without it. But it didn't ruin anything either. This should have been a few episodes that came out a year or 2 after breaking bad "ended". Seriously though, don't take a chaotic perspective while watching this as you did for Breaking Bad, this is Jesse's fate, our beloved character, do a "man who seeks for freedom & peace" perspective, if you are a true Breaking Bad fan, you'll love this! Very disappointed. No way does this feels like a movie to me First of all, this movie is a love letter for the original series , that's why it doesn't have alot of action and events. Still a great screenplay . It's more like an epilogue to the series . I loved seeing Jesse again i always wondered what happened to him. This movie is about him and giving him the ending he deserves. Not a new meth adventure or something like that. So enjoy it for what it really is , because Vince did a fantastic job and Aaron gave the performance of his life. I'm going to miss those characters so much. Currently sitting at 10/10?! Come on breaking bad fans we know the show was good but don't force this to be something it's not. The film is basic and was not needed at all, very slow and quite disappointing tbh. If this stays near the 10 mark on here then god help us all Honestly, I'm a huge Breaking Bad fan, but this movie is just ok, I gave it a seven because of sentimental reasons but would I watch it again? Probably not. Enjoyable and worth watching only for fans of the show. It failed on every level.. the writing, the directing, the acting.. this movie was absurd.
They could have wrapped it up in two scenes to tell us how things ended up with Jesse.. It was a shock that it went on and on for more than two hours without anything really happening..!! But I guess it is not a farewell for Jesse's character anyway.. it is a commercial movie, it is out there for the money.
I cannot even say that I now know what happens with Jesse.. I am simply unable to relate between such a movie and the best TV series ever made..!
To me, that last scene when Jesse was crazily crying, laughing, and shouting was the last thing I saw of Breaking Bad.. This movie was terrible. Huge disappointment. It's slow with no story to follow. This movie isn't even on par with the weakest Breaking Bad episodes. The whole concept of creating a closure for Jesse might've been tempting, but creators evidently lacked ideas and it shows - it's a 2-hour long piece that could've easily fit into 20-30 minutes of a longer, final BB episode. Total waste of time.. Disappointing. A two hour film that milks a 'plot' with little substance. While the cinematography was great, the content surely falls short. Would have expected a more clever story from Vince. What a boring followup into Jesse's life. Absolute disservice to the franchise. This film has only tainted a great series , BORING is an understatement Film was boring and pointless. The film couldve been something great but absolutely nothing happens. Half of its in flashbacks and could have easily been added as the end of the TV series. If more had happened it would have been great Great movie
Love this movie realy l'm love him thx netflix Movie of the year
Vince you did it again you mad man you did it again I'm a Breaking Bad fan! I love this tv show is my favorite ever! But this movie is a garbage. I want back my 2 hours that I spent watching this garbage. Great way to destroy what was absolutely a great ending to a great series... This was the final goodbye we have all waited for as Breaking Bad fans, but it's not really the correct story that should have taken place. Attempting to be a neo-western it falls flat to stereotypical desert tropes and melodramatic gestures. The typical shoot-out scene we see in El Camino is cheesy at best.<br/><br/>The production must have paid for the all the favorable reviews, because this movie is just plain average to me. It seems to flirt with themes found in Better Call Saul rather than Breaking Bad. El Camino would have been better if it was more an isolated creation rather than a Breaking Bad product. Just imagine if this was done by someone -anyone - else but mr Gilligan how would these ratings then look? This is just slow dragging piece of garbage that trashes the most riveting TV shows legacy. I'm saddened to say the least. Well it's great ,nothing i says will become Enough I was very sad to see bb actors have accepted to take role in this 2-hour black hole. Especially bryan cranston! You are supposed to watch this just to see how pinkman gets away. No action, no meth, no exciting stories, no impressive dialogues, absolutely nothing not to mention some meaningless scenes. Ie: pinkman's duello with the man from whom he wants 1800 usd. I think all good things must stay as they are. As a fan of BB, I can't say I needed this. Definitely left me with the "what was the purpose?" I loved and have seen all episodes of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. It is hard to believe El Camino was created by the same people. To say it is confusing is the understatement of the year. Don't waste your time with this. Plain dumb, no nostalgia, no nothing, plain screenplay. Pinkman deserved a happy ending but it was too flat. If Jesse and the FBI knew where the aliens would attack and also the location of Blenbaar's spaceship, why did they murder all those prostitutes? Also the 3 way between Jesse, Badger and Skinny Pete, whilst beautifully shot, did nothing to further the plot and was unnecessarily gratuitous. I just don't understand why someone would give this film a low rating...
We all wondered what could've happened to Jesse Pinkman after Breaking Bad's finale.
Vincent Gilligan gave us HIS answer... and it is beautiful!<br/><br/>If you didn't like it, well, maybe you weren't a fan of the series after all.<br/><br/>-Now... Shut up, and enjoy this film, B#*ch"! I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting, nothing. It just dragged on and on. Don't waste your time. Loved Breaking Bad. I tend not to leave bad reviews but this movie was so slow and empty ! This didn't add any value to whatsoever.
Completely deflated. I feel sorry for myself , I just waisted two hours watching this .<br/><br/>The expectation was too high . Unfortunately , at the end of this movie you will end up with disappointment. This film fulfilled every expectation and just put that last piece needed to complete the epic series Honestly, this is exactly what a Breaking Bad afterstory should be, they really did a good jop on it. Direction/Cinemetography: Amazing. Vince Gilligan made this a visual masterpiece. Every shot is beautifully crafted and is extremely appealing to watch.<br/><br/>Writing: In comparison to Breaking Bad the pacing is a lot slower, though this allows Jesse's story to be very detailed, showing every emotion. The mix of flashbacks and the present story were carefully crafted to tell the story in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Acting: Great overall. Phenomonal performance by Aaron Paul.<br/><br/>Story/Plot: Started off somewhat slow, but the last hour was truly amazing. We get to see how mature Jesse has become after everything he's been through, and how much he's grown since Breaking Bad. We get to see him evolve into a Jesse Pinkman who is finally in control of the wheel, contrary to the naive and easily manipulated Jesse from the show. This is the perfect end to his character arc, as we finally get to see him being invulnerable, strong, and most importantly, happy.<br/><br/>Thank you Vince Gilligan. No wild surprises like how Breaking Bad was every episode. Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows of all time.
I was hoping that this would be a good movie to bring back all of the good memories from the Breaking Bad series.
I was completely wrong.
This movie was a big waste of time.
Nothing happened in the movie, so I was not drawn into the movie.
There wasn't any suspense or extreme fear.
The movie was completely boring.
I hope this review will help prevent other fans from watching this lame movie. The previews made this movie look like it would be just as good as or even better than Breaking Bad. Unfortunately that's not the case at all.<br/><br/>I thought this movie would have had the same intensity as Breaking Bad did. However, just as Better Call Saul as been falling flat this movie did as well.<br/><br/>Having Todd in this film made no sense. Plus the guy looks nothing like he did 6 years ago. Make him diet if he's gonna have that prominent of a role. Otherwise it takes you out of the world of Breaking Bad.
The preview with skinny Pete had no follow up in the film. Would have liked to seen SP and Badger in the film more as they did help Jesse escape. Like what happens to them after they assist Jesse and authorities know that his car was at his home?
Too many flashbacks. Way too many. Walt scene was just to throw fans a bone.
Seemed sloppy and predictable. Not what BB fans were used to.
Was actually hoping that they would tie the movie to season 5 of Better Call Saul somehow and follow Saul/Gene in Nebraska and link Jesse to him. Could have included Jesse as a regular cast member on the final season of BCS. But what do I know?<br/><br/>Was hoping for something way better. In the end I could have done without. Love these guys and just hate to say how boring this movie was. Well obviously millions will watch this film as it piggy backs on the Breaking Bad band wagon , BB and BCS are amongst the top TV shows ever made imo , but this was just a complete waste of time, the entire plot could have been dealt with in a half hour show and I think I'm being generous to it . Gillian and everyone else involved should be thoroughly ashamed It was cool to see how things turned out for Jesse but this wasn't needed. The flashbacks were cool but Fat Todd killed it for me. Best part was getting to see Jesse and Walt on screen together again. This movie is suppose to be right after the end of Breaking Bad. But Jesse's vibe was that of someone who had aged 10 years. Overall it was ok, but that's only because of the throwbacks. Fat Todd really hurt things. After Breaking Bad I had already imagined that Jesse escaped and made his way to a life happily-ever-after in Alaska.<br/><br/>Pretty much what was delivered here.<br/><br/>It was okay (a bit boring) but just an excuse to deliver something to Netflix that they knew would get a billion eyeballs.<br/><br/>Was nice to see some of the old characters again. Not as expected, movie had no story what so ever or too much time has passed since breaking bad and it couldn't connect that well Epic Fail no matter how many Easter Eggs hidden in each shot. The story was slow and literally had nowhere to go! Poor Jesse crying his eyes out in silly situations that he somehow seems to slither out of due to dramatic licence.
Slow moving and uneventful. Like Aaron Paul's movie career it fell short, way short.<br/><br/>A story that was as predictable as you could get, certainly not Breaking Bad style.<br/><br/>Todd looking like he spent 6 years feasting at Los Pollos Hermanos.<br/><br/>6 years Vince had and I respect he's involved in Better call Saul but this movie felt like it was written in 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Too many issues to go into. I mean they added a moment where we're almost supposed to remember the welding guy, I was racking my brain who is this guy, turns out it was just done filler story unrelated really to BB.<br/><br/>The vacumm guy Turing down nearly 250k payday for 1800 bucks. Sure... Then calling the cops. Just filler to slop on the el Camino to add 45mins to the movie.<br/><br/>Jesse has the opportunity to escape, save Brick and kill Todd. Instead he cries like a baby and gives Todd the gun back.<br/><br/>Some random welding arc added to the story.<br/><br/>Unnecessary explosion just because its a movie right.<br/><br/>A wild west shootout.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston in a bald cap.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul aged the best by far. As a stand-alone movie I would rate this a 7. However given how perfect Breaking Bad was as a series this film had a lot to live up to and I think it was executed near perfectly. What would would have made it a 10 would have been a few more characters from the series included. And I feel the outcome of the film was predictable. I wanted to see more wow moments, twists and turns that would add more quality to the series. I have only watched this once but I'm really hoping for people to find Easter eggs which will open up new theories. Would love to see more content from the breaking bad universe. I mean, it was a good movie, for the conclusion of Jesse.
It was nice to see the flashbacks with Walter and Jane and the ending with Jesse starting a new life was the right thing to do. It is the proper end to Jesse's journey. I liked it, Aaron Paul is one of the best actors in Hollywood in my opinion. The only thing that ruins this film for me is the fact that Todd looks way different than it looked in the serie. It is hard to believe that this events really happened when Todd is obviously more aged, I couldn't stop thinking about while watching it. Eversince I heard about El Camino I swear I knew that Aaron Paul did it just for taking advantage of Breaking Bad and trying to steal thunder as usual, no offense to Aron but this is what I feel during the interviews.
There is nothing new in the movie we already knew his life ended up good when we saw him in the show making woodenboxes, so he makes wooden boxes or studying business according to Walt?!
And where was Skinny Pete scene when he was at the police station?!
I rate it 1 of 10 just because Vince Gilligan is an outstand writer I mean if it was another writer the movie would fail .. I'm kinda feeling he was shy to refuse Aaron Paul's request to create a movie just for him.
The other reason of rating the one star is that Bryan Cranston's is there .. I think Walter and Mike's existance was the only good thing for the movie and again the fact that it was written by Vince Gilligan.
I'm never seeing it again and never recommend it to anyone and I'll rewatch breaking bad to clean my mind from this useless movie!
It's wrong to relate such movie to a great show like Breaking Bad.
even the movie's title is arbitrary! How was the car related to all of this?!
And Jesse was fat for such a hard life 🙄
Sophia coughed while being rapped in the carpet
A lot of unnecessary stories 😂
I expected a little bit of Walt's family but it was obvious it's all about Jesse who's fate was already spoiled in the show!
Breaking bad was so deep and it had a lot of sympolism, foreshadowing and lots of literary criticism, I remember how I spent months just analysing and watching videos about the show! It was the greatest show why would we be worried of Jesse's fate and what happened to him we were already happy for his good life we know he had -_- the show was fun while watching and after watching .. if it was really Aaron Paul or anyone else behind the movie but sorry the whole year I spent on breaking bad was amazing and now I feel I wasted 02:02 hours from my life because of the movie!!!
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 Slow and boring. Painful to watch. Going nowhere.
Just watch the tv series. Its much better. A cheap take on Breaking Bad with a broken and bad cinematography that doesn't even come close to the competence level of the TV series production. An unneeded and apathetic episode that only serves to remind us that some things are best left dead. I finished Breaking Bad a while ago, and obviously, I loved it.. I watched Better Call Saul, and I loved that as well.. So when I heard that a continuation to Breaking Bad was coming out, I was skeptical..<br/><br/>I thought there's no way that Vince Gilligan is able to make the third BrBa based project work.. But he did.<br/><br/>The movie takes place right after the events of BrBa, and it focuses on Jesse Pinkman. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the movie is full of references and Easter eggs, and I found myself smiling many times throughout the movie. It's gorgeously directed, and the cinematography is excellent. And Aaron Paul is just as perfect as we all remember.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the movie is not perfect. After the credits start rolling you feel like you want to see more, cause something is missing. Also some parts of the movie feel kinda useless.<br/><br/>Is this a good continuation to BrBa? Yeah.<br/><br/>It didn't harm the ending of the show, and it gave a better ending to Jesse's story.
We're lucky to even have these kind of movies coming out.<br/><br/>Yeah science! There were no pointless moments in this movie: every moment mattered. with details, hidden meanings, and the very original way in which the director creates the mood, this groundbreaking way in which he tells the story does not cease to amaze me.
The viewer has certain expectations of what the film contains, and of course Gilligan knows it, and he doesn't offer what we might expect: no, he offers something bigger, something we can't expect, something that surprises, something that is unpredictable, and that, my friends, is what makes this film very good. I do not say this is a Materpiece (like BB or BCS), but it is very close: very few movie give me such a chills and goosebumbs like this. I had to pause movie couple tuimes and think what i just saw, before i continued.
These are the movies that have the kind of re-watch value that really opens up when you watch the movie second time: because then you get the most out of it by looking at it differently and paying attention to things that are likely to be overlooked at first time.
Movie could be longer than this, but still, it's perfect the way it it is. I really looking forward to Better call saul closure, and and do the stories of the two series intersect. I really hope they do. Gilligan has done flawless job: he is the mastermind behind BB, BCS and now this.
Couple spoilers and thoughts. First of all, i hate that people say Jesse is stupid. For instace that famous "wire"scene. He is youn, meth addict and under the pressure. Seriously, how many people would respond correctly in such a situation, with Walter waving at the copper wire in front of Jesse? When you vere 18-22, vere you intelligent and wise? What becomes character development into pilot to El camino, that is...unprecedented but still completely credible, amazing job. If Aaron doesn't get nominated and rewarded this amazing, captivating, mesmerizing act, i don't watch any movie ever.
Badger and skinny proved true lojalty and friendship, and it was enjoyable to watch.
That scene with Mike from the beginning was beautiful. it also shows that Mike respects Jesse for of his qualities. And as we all know, Mike's repect is hard to deserve. And truly, Jesse is - like Saul goodman says to Walter in Breking bad that "he is'nt so stupid as you think" - determined, and cunning if necessary.
New side of Jesse was realistic: because he was tortured in captivity, so he has become a tough man when needed, it was perfectly credible, that he was able to brutally shoot the men who challenged him. The scene was really thrilling and I watched it twice
Scene with walter: no words, I'm speechless.
Ending scene with Jane broke my heart.
If this movie doesnt wind up in "top 250" movies list, theres something really wrong. Thank you gilligan, and crew, wonderful unforgettable job once again. Looked phenomenal on big screen, definitely recommend checking out in theaters. Sound is 10/10 I am so grateful that this movie delivered what I expected it to. Very nice to see Walter White again. Well Jesse will go wherever the universe takes him. I loved the series of Breaking Bad. This film was a total nonsensical mishmash, with pot holes galore. Numerous flahsbacks which told you nothing, no story, no action. We gave up three quarters of the way through. I cannot understand the high reviews. It is total garbage. Not just an amazing sequel but an outstanding move. Fat Todd!
Ancient Walt!
Yet follows on in timeline directly after end of BB
Dreadful story
C class acting
Poor script
No worthy of being connected to Breaking Bad This is not even close to the quality of an episode of breaking bad. People asking what we were expecting? We were expecting a nice tribute yo! Boring episode of break bad. Not sure how this was released as a movie. This felt tired, stretched & just didn't feel like it had the same vision as Breaking Bad did....in my opinion Breaking Bad finished with Felina not El Camino..... It is the typical OVA for fans. Completely unnecessary, it brings nothing to the plot. As a movie, it's a regular episode.
Breaking Bad: 10
BCS: 7
El Camino: 4-5 (it's hard to say) Super boring and disappointing movie! Trying to wake up the dead! I will avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>The film is styled "breaking bad" which does give a sense of belonging but overall it feels like it was either rushed or the script writing really wasn't checked thoroughly enough.<br/><br/>Some of the returning characters have developed at quite a pace!<br/><br/>Has it ruined my love of BB or BCS - not at all. But this film doesn't do enough.<br/><br/>It is middling at best. I am a huge BB fan and was so looking forward to this movie. I should know better with so much hype and such high expectations...but this was so far from what I was hoping it would be. Not only was I totally bored and didn't even care what happened, the whole thing with Ed the "disappearer guy" was illogical. First of all supposedly you only had one shot with him which Jesse uses up when he walked away the first time. It also made no sense that he still owed $125k for the first time. Ed never would have picked him up without being paid in advance. I could mention many other things but that annoyed me a LOT. Like a lot of other reviewers said, it didn't even feel like the Jesse we knew and loved. I was so happy when he escaped at
the end of BB but I had zero feelings for him throughout this movie. Oh well. Honestly I don't understand how there are so many good reviews here because I really hated this movie.
There's no point in making a Breaking Bad movie without Walter White, the lawyer, Mike, Hank and the rest of the cast. If the movie was going to be about flashbacks, all the characters should be there but instead is only Todd there, Walter shows up in one little scene only!
I've been waiting to watch a Breaking Bad movie for years after the show was over, just like every fan. Last night I did and it was extremely boring, it didn't make a lot of sense to me, I thought I was going to watch something completely different. There are too many flash backs with Todd, who is super fat and old. The movie should be about what happened with Jessie after he escaped, not when he was held captive. I spent 2 hours watching Todd's face on the screen!!!! The director gave him so much time! Its unbelievable! So, after all we still don't know what happened with Jessie's life. The whole movie is about flashbacks with Todd and Jessie stole money and moved out to Alaska. That's it!!! SAD Come on guys, the movie is great.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>Its the best jesse can get in this world and he chose it. Although there are doubts about what happened to the White family, Saul Goodman, Brock, Skinny pete, Badger.
But I trusted Vince and he did a great job on the movie.Now I have to wait for season five of Better call saul to find some answers. I believe a rating of 6 is fair, the storyline wasn't exciting at all. Both Jesse and Todd were like 20lbs over the weight they were when the show ended in 2013 and it was very noticeable in their faces. I know it's only minor but little stuff like that matters to me. They should of left everything how it was, no need for this movie. Unfortunately I fell for the hype and was disappointed. It's a good flick for a rainy day but nothing more. This movie is a logical continuation of what Jesse goes through and handles it as if we are watching more of the show and is therefore great with some tense scenes and great performances, as always. Vince Gilligan yet again delivers a great finale for a terrific character. I thought El Camino was a total anti-climax. When it was released I was so excited that I went back and binge watched BB from the beginning. I loved it just as much as when I first watched the show. El Camino felt like an attempt to shoehorn a couple more episodes of the show in after the fact. I guess it ties up a loose end or two, but really I do t think it was at all necessary... While fairly entertaining the movie didn't really have much going on. Greetings<br/><br/>Being a fan of Breaking Bad, I really anticipated something better from this film. Basically, it continues the story of Jesse, who wants to go to Alaska, with the appearance of dead characters from the TV show being prevalent. Hadn't it been for the cinematography, this would have been a total disaster. My rating is 5 for disappointing.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Julio Protopapas A strikingly superficial, careless and predictable film. Another open finale. I would not be surprised if a sequel comes out in a couple of years. But the most painful is how Gilligan destroyed the moral growth of Jesse's character. Jesse wasn't a killer by nature, but now he was. The whole story with these new poorly written villains seemed meaningless. Especially the shootout. I used to want Jesse to run away and find peace. But the way it was shown was very disappointing. Would have given a minus score if I could. Can not believe you'd have such a great material and you end up making this super boring nonsense which goes nowhere! Not sure what the point of this flick was. At very least, it is anything but timely, where some actors don't even look like characters they played in the show anymore, that's how long it's been (Todd, for one, needs to hit the treadmill hard). It had a few good moments, but in the end I felt like it did not amount to anything meaningful. I loved the original series, although after literally struggling through the longest 2 hours of my life all I want to say is... this movie sucks!!! I understand that hardcore fans wanted a definitive closure for the Breaking Bad story but... was it really necessary? The series is one of the best production that I ever watched, the plot is amazing and well developed, and characters are unforgettable.<br/><br/>"El Camino" describe what happens to Pinkman after that famous night, in which Heisenberg died. Jesse needs still to fight to obtain his freedom, but confrontations with villains this time are completely unrealistic and definitely forced and exaggerated. Writers did not know how to develop the plot, so they put an explosion, some shootings, a few flashbacks, to hit the 2 hours length, and that's the Breaking Bad Movie. I am not sure if Vince Gilligan really wanted to write and produce this movie, and I don't think that Aaron Paul wanted to play in it as well. The Brian Cranston cameo, that should be memorable, is simply a pretty standard dialogue with Jesse about his future.<br/><br/>I understand why they did this movie, Jesse was and is still an iconic character and he deserved a special "episode" completely about him, so fans can give one last goodbye to the character. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie: the TV show set really high standards and I was expecting more or less the same quality. In my opinion they should have let things as they were. OMG!! Why were the scenes soooo damn long?!?!?
Couldn't keep myself intrigued. Those flashbacks were unnecessary.
The last 2 scenes just stretched it even more. Could've been only 90 mins long instead of 120 Had such high hopes for this movie. Plodding and slow best describes it. Could have been consolidated into a one-hour movie.<br/><br/>El Camino doesn't give a good recap of the events that occurred 6 years ago on BB, but relies on some occasional flashbacks to explain Jesse's state of mind. One is left wondering if the producer's original intent was to spin this off give Jesse his own series and just gave up on it.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul is a great actor and his talent does carry this film. Unfortunately, the writers presented a middle of the road script and didn't give him a whole lot to work with. An appetizer with no main meal.<br/><br/>Could have been so much better. Incomplete. The acting was superb, but the story line was odd and I found myself extremely unsatisfied...there just didn't seem to be one in the sense that it made the entire story seem random. I assume that most people watching this movie are fans of the TV show Breaking Bad. There is definitely a little bit of nostalgia that creeps in when you watch a movie about one of the characters in a show you liked and you see characters in flashbacks on the screen. Once you are over the nostalgia aspect though, the movie falls flat. Some of the flashbacks felt like they were just dragging on and didn't add much to the story. The whole movie is very slow moving and you could sum up the entire plot in a sentence or two without losing anything. At least we got an ending for Jesse Pinkman. Here's both the strength and weakness of this film, the origin. Technically speaking, this film is perfect. The montage sequences and fresh and inovative ,the camera angles and transitions are unique, acting is superb, set, lighting, placement, form, editing, all perfect. Even the script is excellently laid out. The issue here lies in the focus of the title: A Breaking Bad Movie. This movie relies heavily on the origin of the hit television show. Although it is exciting to see all the favourite characters again, and it keeps the same intended charm and feel the original show had, it falls some what flat on the plots limitations. There is no compelling emotions for the main character here or sense of danger for him as we all assumed prior that our antihero would either escape or be punished for his lifelong spree of wrong doings. Without spoiling anything, the plot is sadly very shallow and predictable, at times dull and stale. This movie sadly does not quite move along the plot of this very successful television universe, but it does the up loose ends which fans assumed was the conclusion from the original series finale.
This movie, from a mise en scene stand point is perfect and inspirational on all technical levels, however the restrictions of the plot gives this film a lower score in general. Wow, what a way to spoil one of the best TV shows out there. Now it was clear from the start that there is zero point in making this movie apart from its creators making more money, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.<br/><br/>Basically, the entire film is dedicated to pathetic humiliation of Pinkman, both in past and present. For example, in the past, it is shown that he is so worthless that he couldn't make his escape when literally handed a gun. In the present, he's so lowly he steals from his poor parents. I never liked Pinkman's character in the original show, but the El Camino version reached new heights in making him unlikable. Moreover, he is different from his BB show version. I mean, once given the chance, he straggles Todd in the final episode with no remorse, but in this insult of a movie, he breaks down in tears and says he likes Pepperoni pizza when given an opportunity to shoot him with no witnesses around. Really painful to watch.<br/><br/>There's a bunch of fan service with various cameos, but a lot of references didn't even work for me, as the show ended what, 6 years ago, and I don't remember all the plot details.<br/><br/>Season 5 of Breaking Bad was a largely unnecessary epilogue, as season 4 wrapped things up nicely, but it ended up having some of the best episodes of the entire show. This, however, is a shameless spit in the face of the audience. If you hold any good memories of Breaking Bad, do yourself a favor and skip this. On its own, El Camino stands as another 4/10 movie, struggling to find its focus and strange due to the characters' extreme aging since 2013.<br/><br/>For a non Breaking Bad fan, this is extremely passable and SHOULD NOT be an introduction to the series, to which it does not pay the deserved homage.<br/><br/>All in all, I give it a 6/10 for the memories and some small details in character development. El Camino is a beautifully shot, thoughtful ending for Jesse Pinkman I thought I'm going to watch something special but it was a disappointment for me i rather watch the series over and over again it's better than the movie and better call sual This movie is like two long Breaking Bad episodes. This is classic BB, atmospheric, suspenseful and smart. Any fan of the show should be delighted with El Camino.<br/><br/>You just have to keep your expectations in check, because this cannot be another Hollywood blockbuster. This isn't a three-hour affair like Endgame where every character has to make a grand and meaningful entrance into the final battle. Unlike Endgame, this is a movie that focuses on continuing the plot of something much bigger than itself and it stays true to that. This is Breaking Bad through and through, and the movie doesn't attempt to bite off more than it can chew.<br/><br/>We have the continuation of Jesse's narrative, and it's executed perfectly. There are some scenes where old characters appear, and these scenes seem forced to some people, because they don't influence the plot. What I think people are missing, though, is the fact BB was a very important and powerful show, one that merits seeing remarkable characters on the screen together for the last time. It's an hommage to Breaking Bad and it should be there. Not fan service, but an hommage. The difference being precisely that the scenes didn't influence the plot, in the sense that they weren't shoehorned into the movie because they had to be. It was just a few moments of nostalgia and I'm glad the movie delivered that at no expense to the rest of it, which was as original and intelligent as Breaking Bad usually was.<br/><br/>Well done to Vince Gilligan and the rest of the team for not forcing this to be something it's not. This was a fitting conclusion to one of the best series ever made and the movie took itself seriously enough not to go overboard with anything. Just classic attention to detail, plot twists and character lines that make you see just how inferior everything else is. I've Seen so Many Bad Reviews about "El Camino" Everyone thought
it would be better or equal to Breaking Bad; but the thing is you can't surpass perfection. Breaking Bad is undoubtedly the best TV series of all time in My Opinion. so just because it isn't better than Breaking Bad doesn't mean it sucks. for me I loved this movie, and i loved every second of it i didn't feel the time at all, and I'm so glad to have a proper send-off for on of my favorite characters of all time. Where to begin with this overrated nonsense.<br/><br/>Firstly, if you are going to make this an immediate continuation of the series then at least make the actors make an attempt to be in a similar shape to when they had the role. The worst offender was Todd (Jesse Plemons) who was overweight and looked middle aged, Badger (Matt Jones) could have done with a few workouts as well. Everyone else - aside from the ageless Brian Cranston - looked more wrinkled and had less hair.<br/><br/>Several of the actors sounded like bad impersonations of their original roles, as if they'd just been given the script and asked to do a single take. Badger especially sounded awkward delivering his 'Yo' lines as a middle aged man.<br/><br/>OK, the aging actors playing their younger selves aside, this story added nothing of note that made it a worthwhile addition to the Breaking Bad universe. The series had ended well with Jesse's riding into the proverbial sunset and all it did was add a few wrinkles (excuse the pun) to that other than, arguably, without giving away spoilers, makes his character more ruthless.<br/><br/>A lot of the scenes are drawn out and boring, and they really stretched out the content to fill the running time. This may have just about been worth making had it been done a year or two after the series had finished with the actors still young and fresh enough to reprise their roles properly, but as it is only Aaron Paul does a decent job among the returning actors and that alone is not enough to carry a film that doesn't add anything new to the story other than a few extra details to Jesse's escape. Writing this as the worlds biggest Breaking Bad fan (I know we all say that) felt completely underwhelmed by this, have to agree with other reviews and this should have just been the last episode of the series. It would have followed perfectly from 'Felina' the flashbacks were just nonsensical featuring the very bloated Todd, the whole thing just seemed like a complete waste of time, I'm just gonna forget it happened and remember Breaking Bad for the legend it was! I know some people were disappointed in this sequel to Breaking Bad, but I wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>One thing that El Camino did that a lot of shows do not do after they've been off the air for a year or longer - is show a recap. Nothing worse than sitting down to a show you've been waiting to see come back, only to realize that you can't remember anything that happened like six years ago or whenever the last episode ran.<br/><br/>The movie begins where the finale left off -- the traumatized, tortured Jesse racing away from his old meth-making life. Suffering from PTSD, he runs for help from two friends from the old show, Skinny Pete and Badger (Charles Baker and Matt Jones who turn out to be not just friends but amazing friends, feeding him letting him sleep, bathe, trading cars with him, and giving him money.<br/><br/>However, Jesse is far away from real freedom from the police and, more importantly, himself. For this, he will need serious help.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes from the past, when Jesse was held captive, are very hard to take. What I liked was the tension that was present throughout the film - you just never knew what was going to happen.<br/><br/>It was wonderful to see Jonathan Banks, but for me, seeing Robert Forster as Ed, from whom Jesse needs big help. He was from my home town, and I interviewed him at around the time he did Jackie Brown. This is his second-last credit before his death three days ago.<br/><br/>It turned out I knew his old girlfriend (and I got them back in touch) and one of his wives. Later I had some business dealings with his lovely daughter Kate. He was the real deal - a good man, a hard worker, and a fantastic actor. RIP. Part of the beauty to the end of the show was the mystery in regards to the fate of Jesse Pinkman, but I thought that they made a satisfying epilogue that made a nice addition to the show. There was a nice balance of story and cameos. Jesse Plemons stole the show in some of the flashback scenes reprising his role of Todd. Breaking Bad is without a doubt the greatest TV show in history. One of a few things I would give a full on 10/10 to. However, the last few episodes of breaking bad we're centered on Walt, and that made sense, as Walt was the main character. Felina gave us closure on the story of Walter White, and now, El Camino gives us closure on the story of Jesse Pinkman. Is it anywhere near as good as BrBa? No, and I don't think it would've even been possible to get any movie up to that level of masterful storytelling. Is it necessary? No. Is it a welcome addition to a masterpiece of a franchise? Absolutely. Solid film, great characters, great cinematography, fantastic writing, and nostalgic fun. Only downside is that it doesn't entirely feel like it's in the same universe as breaking bad and better call Saul. It feels more like a fan fiction, but a very good one at that. Watch if you want, it's not necessary if you want to just leave what happens after felina to your imagination, but if you love these characters, I would definitely recommend this movie. Breaking Bad has been more of an emotion for me than a mere TV show. The thought provoking ideas & plot twists, the intense & realistic acting, the heartbreaking moments along with a lethal mix of violence & emotions sets it apart from all the other TV shows. To understand this movie you definitely have to watch the entire series, else you won't be able to get much out of it.<br/><br/>This film is an epilogue to the TV series and shows the journey of Jesse Pinkman following his escape from the crime scene after killing Todd and where Walt dies killing all of Jack's men using his mind blowing trick of the automatic machine gun hidden in the car trunk.<br/><br/>The film has a nonlinear narrative, presenting the past & the present events interspersed together. It starts off impressively, building a lot of expectations to it but sadly disappoints the viewer with a not so convincing climax, making you feel that there should have been a bit more to it at the end. The screenplay is rather engaging throughout the length of the film.<br/><br/>The film revisits some of the characters from the show and you get to see a handful of them. There are some heart warming moments along with some thrilling ones which mainly act as the key takeaways. There is one scene which shows the meaning of true friendship which truly stands out, giving you immense satisfaction if you're indeed a true fan of the series.<br/><br/>The actors in this film recreate the magic which they previously showed in the series. Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman literally gives you goosebumps. Charles Baker as Skinny Pete gives an astounding performance in one particular scene. Jesse Plemons who plays Todd also performs well, however he disappoints due to his body weight which he has gained since the series finale. I hate to say it but he looks fat, somewhat making it difficult for the viewer to accept him as the same young vicious killer from Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a satisfying end to the greatest TV series of all time but leaves you a tad disappointed as many would have expected a bit more from it. I liked the ending of the series, but this is a nice addition too! Really enjoyed it! I like this show very much, the movie either. However, Fat Todd distract me all the time. He is the man who destroy Breaking Bad. I watched and at first and Ifelt a little disappointed because it is not an astonishing movie. But thinking about it was extremely necessary to give us an ending to Jesse Pinkman. The movie stands for itself but I think the ones who has never watched the series would not be thrilled! For those who who has, it will be a delightful and wonderful surprise! First off - Absolute fan of BB / BCS / Vince Gilligan, but this left me wondering who's storyline it really was. As much as people think it's about Jesse, I see the majority of this tale being about Todd and his mindset of how the world works (while keeping Jesse as a slave).<br/><br/>Additional I thought it a bit drawn out with the almost game-style side quest of "Get more money to pay your passage" that the story strongly hinged on.<br/><br/>Sorry folks, this is not the ending you're looking for. There is no way this movie gets a rating below 8 . People rating low are overhyped bi***es who always ruin ratings on shows . This movie was very realistic , about what happened to Pinkman. We don't need to sugar coat everything . It's not a commercial film , it's an art film for breaking bad fans . Some annoying son of b******s are rating it low just because realism is not part of their unicorn fantasies mf Breaking Bad is one of the best series. Like I said I expected too much from a film that call itself a Breaking Bad film. I wouldn't really call it that. It almost has everything an episode of Breaking Bad has. Very good acting, cinematography, directing. Everything, except a story you really care about. If this film was split in scenes you would have seen throughout the series itself it would have been great, however the pacing is rather slow and some scenes suffer from that. They just feel like they extended it to make them more tense. Though that is one of the qualities as well in this film. There's a lot of tension.<br/><br/>Jessie Pinkman was mostly interesting to me when it involved Walter and that's lacking obviously in this film. Because some actors didn't age well, like Jesse Plemons, who plays Todd, some of the scenes aren't that convincing. It looks like he went through a mid-life crisis during the series, Jesse looks a little older, though he still looks convincing enough. If you're expecting more of Saul Goodman or other main characters, except Walter, then don't hold your breath. I didn't except them really, though I had hoped to see more of Walter White, It's still a solid film, so it's worth watching, though it's certainly not in the same league as Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul. I did think it had a satisfying ending, just don't get your hopes up. This is the best end of this tv show and of the character of Jesse Pinkman BB is one of the best drama in my recollection. But it's hard to break the good work in post creation. It's totally understandable. Also, you got to watch BB tv else won't get an idea what's this movie above. The flashback didn't help and just okay. But this movie hardly convince people to watch back the TV as the TV is too brilliant. Jessie wants to find his money, get a new ID and move to Alaska, BORING, many scenes made no sense and Aaron said there would be a huge ending, when will we see it? Too confusing and slow, This movie provided a welcome, but somewhat incomplete sense of closure for those who watched Breaking Bad. A lot of precious minutes of this movie were wasted on scenes that were cinematic, but not very detailed. A lot of time spent trying to paint the picture that Todd is a psychopath on deeper levels - too much time, if you ask me. We got the point pretty early on. I think most Breaking Bad fans wanted and expected more detail in this film. I personally felt that it was also lacking in emotional profundity. I teared up very briefly at the end, but it was too fast paced, even at the end, to really feel much of anything or take it in emotionally. I really would have liked to see more "stillness" at the end, a nice long scene of Jesse finally being able to take a deep breath and reflect, and maybe just cry. My favorite thing about the series was how far down the rabbit hole you could go in regards storyline. The movie I felt was the complete opposite. Even the use of Walt was done poorly. So many ways they could have flashed him back and yet it felt like Walt was tacked on to the end just so they could say he was in it.<br/><br/>Loved skinny Pete in this, he really took looking like an meth head to the next level but at the same time showed that addicts can have souls too. Great to see them all again, just wish it would have been a better script. Once you get over how different the cast looks, the film is stunning to look at - you know straight away this wasn't a made-for-tv film.
The cinematography is superb and is on par with any A-List film released in the last decade. The locations shots of the deserts of ABQ, and the snow lined roads in Alaska were top notch. Another technique that really made an impression on me were the "lock-on" shots used during some of the driving scenes.
I'm sure this same camera technique was used in Breaking Bad and it was a nice little flourish that helped ground this movie within the BrBa universe.
In that vain, despite the score being pretty good, I was a bit disappointed there weren't more musical motifs calling back to some of the iconic musical pieces in Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I've seen a few reviewers mention that Jesse Pinkmans character had little room to grow, and I agree with this sentiment.
However, I don't think that this is a wholly bad thing - his character had completed his arc by the end of season four anyway - but it is true that there is little room and this in itself is an issue, even if Jesse's "lack of growth" is not.<br/><br/>This movie feels like it's three acts stretched over a five act time period - and while the movie never gets boring, it never takes any major risks, either.
Maybe this was a problem with having a more realistic story.
I was (foolishly) awaiting a dramatic twist - maybe Jesse would meet Saul in Omaha. Maybe he wouldn't get the money and he'd have to find a new way to Alaska.
Either way, there was no twist - just a good, old fashioned, through and through story.<br/><br/>I know this is my problem, because my expectations were high, but I also feel it's worth mentioning that I was awaiting scenes from the trailer that ultimately didn't make it into the movie - so I'm not convinced my expectations were entirely unrealistic.
Also, Jesse having the duel and blowing the welding shop to smithereens felt more than a little out of character.
In the end though, despite giving a solid conclusion, the lack of a twist (and subsequent acts that would follow) leaves me feeling a bit unsatisfied.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. It's worthy of being in the BrBa canon, but it could've been better, especially seeing as it's effectively just a second part to the final episode of a show that ended six or so years ago.
Definitely watch if you like BrBa. Continues the story of breaking really well, the acting, directing and cinematography is beautiful. It brings a satisfying end to Jesse Pink man's story with lots of tense moments along the way. After six long years, we see the continuation of the story where it left, it is really heartwarming to see the story's next venture and yet wrenchingly poignant. Aaron Paul spot on nails his character again and is probably much better than ever. The film is very aesthetically shot with a subtle but roaring soundtrack. Vince Gilligan's mastery is still sharp as he left it, a simple plot structurally sound and well executed.
It does slow down for a certain amount of time but completely forgettable. It has a very Logan feel to it and is arguably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
A definite 9/10 for me.
Thank you, Vince; Thank you, Aaron; Thank you everyone who worked on this. First, when I heard about the Breaking Bad movie I felt scared about if it will ruin the Best tv show of all times but after watching it , I wasn't dissapointed and I was happy again with the Ending.
So , thank you Vince Gilligan ..
Second, I dont know why there is a lot of people did not like the movie , its true that its not at the same level as the serie and it doesnt deserve a score more than 8 but guys you are expecting too much ..
Before the realising , Vince Gilligan said that the movie will focus just on Jesse life after the escaping so why you are expecting to see a lot of BrBa characters like Saul , Hank , Skayler ...ect
At least we are lucky to see some flashback scenes with Walter , Todd , Mike and Jane .
And also Saul has his own spin off and it contain a lot of BrBa characters and maybe the 5th season will have more . Nice to see what happens next but the only downside is I'm left wanting more Mr Gilligan. Jesse was always my favourite character he was essentially good and I'm so pleased he finally escaped.
Why there are negative reviews about El Camino I just don't understand, to me it was a seamless transition and brilliantly written, I loved it. It was a great ending to Jesse's story. We may not have gotten to see some people we would have liked to, but this was always going to be Jesse's story, and that's exactly what we got. I have not a single bad thing to say about this movie. It was everything I wanted it to be. That's enough I suppose. Oh wait I have to know the stupid who hire the guy who created the most awful sounds used in a movie. I won't say that's a bad movie, the story telling and especially directing are awesome, in the pure line of the BREAKING BAD series. But everything here is so predictable, I would say casual in the topic. The ending awful for me. So please Don't compare this with the series. This is the Jessee Epilogue we were all waiting, and it's worth every second of it. The film was such a let down after Breaking bad series Its too long for a nonsense movie , hated from the beggining to the end , as all netflix productions is empty , stupid and over rated. Shame of movie, please dont waste your time as i did. This movie could have been 30 minutes and would still have been too long for the story line. Very boring and methodical wrap up to what was next for Aaron Paul. If I hadn't watch this, I wouldn't have missed anything. Well shot but story wasn't particularly engaging. Disappointing. Slightly disappointing after BB was amazing. Not sure what i expected but it didn't really go very far I loved Breaking bad and its still my number one box set. I was really excited to watch this but ended up being one of the most disappointing movie's i have watched. This movie discredits the master piece that was the series. The movie was slow, no real story line and overall extremely boring. I loved Breaking Bad and I thought the ending was perfect. Then the trailer for El Camino came along and fanned the flames of excitement once more.<br/><br/>Pinkman is back!<br/><br/>The trailer promised action, excitement, and a conclusion to Pinkman's story. You get all that.<br/><br/>You also get 30+ minutes of padding in the form of "flashbacks", without which the movie would have been much better in terms of pacing. Too often I found myself wondering "Why are they showing this?" and I still don't have an answer.<br/><br/>I've heard people say stuff like "Normally I'd rate this a 6, but since it's Breaking Bad it deserves at least an 8." If that's a way of thinking you've adopted in the past you may enjoy El Camino and if not, just temper your expectations going in. Too much (fat) Todd. He was the worst character of breaking bad and now we have to watch an entire movie that is basically about him. It was lenghty and very boring. Nothing much happens over 2 hours, this movie could easy had been 1.5hours. He talked about soup for 10 minutes. He opened soup and cooked it. Then they had mac and cheese. The king of the boring flashback has once again proven his time is up. He must be smoking that blue stuff to have such a glaring continuity error. Plus it's just not a good movie. Gilligan is a fool. I think the reaction to this movie is suffering from overly high expectations. I also think it's unfair that everyone is giving guff that Todd looks a little more filled out. I mean in back to the future, the main girlfriend completely changed to a different actress. He is older and has other acting gigs like fargo that require a different look, you've gotta use a bit of imagination at least it's still the same actor. The movie isn't perfect, but it's really solid, good mix of nostalgia for fans, enrichment on Jessie's story in the past, and new compelling adventures for Jessie. Personally I felt a little lack of closure with Jesse's story at the end of breaking bad and this was just what I was hoping for. If you miss breaking bad, want one last taste of the breaking bad awesomeness, and want to see what happened to Jesse after Walt freed him, this movie is perfect for you. If you drop expectations and just enjoy it for what it is, and don't get hung up on visual continuity issues, I'm sure you will really enjoy the movie as much as I did. I say thanks to Vince Gilligan for giving us this. I think a lot of us breaking bad fans wanted it badly. The story that was left to be told... Jesse Pinkman and the aftermath of his imprisonment. What this movie does is to show us exactly what happens to him, and how he attempts to leave everything behind. Aaron Paul hits it with a lustrous performance, once again demonstrating his acting chops are up to par, considering he is the only major character in this film. Apart from him, the rest of the cast stand up pretty well too, including the late Robert Forster who reprised his role. Vince Gilligan as always did a magnificent job with the writing and also directing.<br/><br/>Vince wrote the most plausible ending possible for Jesse, that's why it feels so sastisfying to me. He encountered a series of obstacles in his way, including his own state of mind, that helped to raise the tension at certain moments in the film. Those moments kept the mood captivating and intriguing, specially since people who love the show are emotionally attached to Jesse as a character, so we all root for him. That is a huge factor that comes in to play while experiencing this film. I found extremely appealing the fact that Jesse had to do everything on his own, only with little assistance. That certainly speaks about the fact of how much he has grown as a character. He acted intelligently, although there are still emotional residues that can make the firmest man hesitate. This is his farewell letter.<br/><br/>El Camino serves as a remarkable epilogue to a superlative TV series; the final chapter that remained; the only principal character's arc to be closed, and I can safely say that it is like the cherry on top. A ribbon on a gift box. Incredible, stomach went numb, world around me shut off, as effective as the series, I'll have to watch the series for a 3rd time! I can't wait for the new Better Call Saul Felina was the wrapping paper, El Camino is the ribbon.
It's sad to see the amount of people disappointed in this movie. I understand this is all subjective put personally I thought the movie was incredible. It was the perfect epilogue to the series and completed Jesse's story in such a satisfying way. It's the closure we as the audience could only desire, and more than a tribute to the series. So please, realize that this was never meant to be what Endgame was for the MCU, with crazy SFX and action non-stop, but rather Gilligan's masterpiece being fully finished.<br/><br/>Felina was the wrapping paper, this is the ribbon. A perfect bonus for all the Breaking Bad fans.
Not at all disappointing. The quality of this movie is insanely great. The movie is very satisfying for a true breaking bad fan. It's very calm and everything is well thought, the only thing i would have loved, were more flashbacks of Walter White and a longer run time. All in all it's a masterpiece and not a action movie.<br/><br/>Story 9/10
Camera 10/10
Satisfaction: 9/10
All in all: 10/10<br/><br/>Perfect.
Well made Vince Gilligan and everyone who had something to do with the movie ! Brilliant ending for Jesse. I rewatched the breaking bad series before the movie and paid more attention to Jesse than Walt unlike the first time around. (As I knew the movie was coming out)
Im glad we find out what happens and was satisfied with the conclusion. Slow paced and plenty of tension, the flashbacks were good (although fat Todd was a bit annoying) El Camino is a perfect ending to the Breaking Bad saga, Whatever my expectations were, they are certainly satisfied<br/><br/><br/><br/>FAREWELL BREAKING BAD UNIVERSE. This is a must watch. Rounds of the series perfectly. I think this is best film from Netflix in this year El camino no have Breaking Bad soul 10/10 persons are fans and jesse can go alaska No need to explain anything just watch it. Suspense, gritty Making El Camino must have been one of the hardest films ever to make, with all the hype and expectations that the tv series left in peoples mind. However, this film does not disappoint, it was a very well done movie. Is it amazing, or a must-watch for breaking bad fans? No, i wouldn't say that, however it definitely was a very good movie that I would highly recommend people watch. When it comes down to it El Camino is Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul showing off, but in the best possible way.<br/><br/>This wasn't really a story that needed to be told, I for one was perfectly satisfied with the way Breaking Bad concluded, but that doesn't mean giving this one a watch won't be a worthwhile experience. I certainly found that it was. It was overall a good movie and it's nice to see that someone got the ending he deserved (tbf we all knew he was gonna end up in Alaska). The camera work and the shots were very Breaking Bad and hence fantastic, aswell as the acting.<br/><br/>Overall it was too predictable and therefore felt very slow in a lot of moments in my opinion. I also miss the conclusions to Badger and skinny Pete. The flashbacks were decent, but didn't feel necessary enough to be included or that long. Jesse Plemons looked very different compared to Breaking Bad, but I can live with that.<br/><br/>The worst scene is the Western duel. People shooting at each other from 6 feet and can't hit with a single shot. That feels way too constructed and unbelievable.<br/><br/>Still overall a good movie, but I was hoping for something that grabbed me more. Structured like theatrical cinema, not like an extended episode. Like many episodes of the show, however, it's a painfully slow-burn to an explosive (literally, in this case) final act. How they made this in secret is as mind-blowing as getting to see Jesse's story wrapped up 5 years later. What a privilege. One of if not the best movies of the year only problem is some actors look older. Basically Pinkman's story epilogue, that goes nowhere slowly. A nice book-end for Jesse's character but has no impact on the BB universe nor has any attempt to carry the blue-meth story beyond what we already knew back in 2013 Such a rubbish movie, a complete waste of time. Nothing like the level of breaking bad. No such point to movie Even after chopping a bunch of scenes the movie looks completed. Slow narration did not help in making the movie interesting rather its started boring. Anyways not dissapointed completely. This movie gave the closure that was needed for such a beloved character like Jesse Pinkman. By the sounds of it, some people expected Walt to rise from the grave and for the pair to go on a killing spree together.<br/><br/>It was realistic and not too far fetched. Jesse's friends Badger and Skinny Pete showed they were true friends and that not everyone thought Jesse was a monster. And the best line was arguably the one Walt said, "you didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special." it just reminds Jesse his life isn't over and he has the chance to start a new life which Walt never got.<br/><br/>Overall, a great story and the cinematography was definitely up a level compared to the show. I do hope they leave the series now and don't tarnish the name, it's a great ending. Adds nothing new to the Breaking Bad world. Seems like Aaron Paul did it for the cash. The story is pretty much over. The whole movie overutilized the idiot plot. Why would the white supremacists hold Jesse hostage and treat him like garbage if he's making them a fortune? You're being treated brutally like that, why not just refuse to make anything and be done with it? You're dead anyways. He did have some sort of leverage. The vacuum cleaner guy scene was dumb too. He would lose $248K because Jesse is short $2K? Really?<br/><br/>From what we saw of the movie, it seems they are setting up for more of these movies, maybe sequels. This was not a necessary addition to the franchise. It was slow paced and uninteresting. Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman suffered so much in BREAKING BAD, just working with Bryan Cranston's Walter White alone, it's easy to forget the hell he went through in the 11th hour without his mentor...<br/><br/>Spending half of this sequel movie decompressing mentally, physically and emotionally from having been locked up by the White Supremacist uncle of the mellow yet nefarious Todd, who has more screentime here than Pinkman's two living tweeker buddies, Skinny Pete and Badger: the latter with some of the most contrived, cringe-worthy dialogue ranging from quips about short buses to naming every brand of clothing and toiletry they own. It just didn't seem very natural, or like they would ever say things like SKINNY PETE: "You couldn't drive a two-button elevator." BADGER: "You couldn't drive Miss Daisy!"<br/><br/>But this isn't really part of that legendary cable series, it's a movie, supposedly, and feels more like what creator Vince Gilligan has been doing with he and Peter Gould's prequel, BETTER CALL SAUL. So EL CAMINO moves in a cautious and meticulous fashion, with particular scenes lasting much longer than necessary. Which is fine for SAUL being an intentionally pulpy, slowburn serial...<br/><br/>But here, two hours is all we get to experience Jesse's deliverance from the life of frantic crime, and while he goes back and forth in time wielding his usual angst-ridden, torturous expressions, it's all too easy somehow. The hippie junkman pulls off quick miracles while a (somewhat) new band of villains are straight out of a simplistic Western, and that's really what Gilligan has made here: A kind of HIGH NOON aftermath that also features the late Robert Forster as the "Disappearing Guy" at his Best Quality Vacuum store...<br/><br/>And Forster and Paul's scene is the best thing going, far superior to Jesse's desert days as Todd's hopeless captor, or a flashback-of-a-flashback with Bryan Cranston as the rudimentary naÃ¯ve, heavily-coughing Mr. White. Proving how classic the show was a decade ago since that finely-tuned edge just isn't there any longer.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if EL CAMINO were the pilot of a Jesse Pinkman series, it'd be just that: a beginning after an end with potential for the future. Sadly, it's the end of the end, and spends too much time circling around old beginnings to truly feel like the curtain call BREAKING BAD fans, or Jesse Pinkman himself, truly deserves. Bottom line: if EL CAMINO were the pilot of a Jesse Pinkman series, it'd be just that: a beginning after an end with potential for the future...<br/><br/>Sadly, it's the end of the end, and spends too much time circling around old beginnings to truly feel like the curtain call BREAKING BAD fans, or Jesse Pinkman himself, truly deserves - yet it's still pretty cool to see the resilient "Lonely Man" the kid's turned into. Not to just say compliments, there was a little thing which was annoying me during the movie. The thing was Todd being so much older and fatter in the flashbacks, though Walter and other guys were just fine.
To be fair, and I mean really fair, it was a 2019 Vince Gilligan masterpiece! Considering the beautiful shots and cinematography, this guy just gave me the feeling like I can easily go and watch BB once again! As a two-hour movie, he just put the right amount of excitement inside the script and though there was a lack of main characters (who mostly died or went away in the main series) he managed to bring the flashbacks right at time, with a great video and sound mixing. Not to forget the main element here, Aaron Paul can makes you believe that after five or six years, he still has a Jesse Pinkman inside (but not necessarily the good-old version!). I'm really glad Netflix did this, I think that there was weight behind doing this movie and it was a good ending to Jesse's story, I personally think that there won't be anymore story for Jesse Pinkman, but if Netflix wanna do more movies in the 'breaking bad' universe it wouldn't surprise me.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the movie was the Walter and Jesse flashback, it was a really wholesome scene between the two that had a lot of weight and meaning, which ultimately tells us that Jesse has still got his whole life ahead of him, and he'll probably get to enjoy it now.<br/><br/>Thank you to Netflix, Vince Gilligan and the creative team behind this movie, Breaking bad and Better call Saul, for giving the fans a really nice closure to this character.<br/><br/>9.5/10 That was like the last episode of breaking bad.. it blew me away. And left me feeling bittersweet. Here's the main problem with this movie (and it has lots of problems): the series had an incredible ending. There was absolutely no need to go any further. Better Call Saul has had a few moments telling the back story, but mostly it's long-winded and hugely boring. El Camino is a ginormous bore.<br/><br/>This movie didn't have enough chops to support even a single episode of the series yet it was TWO HOURS LONG! Endless shots of the desert, and a really boring scene in a restaurant.<br/><br/>I think that you can put all of the great reviews of this down to nostalgia for the series. The flash backs and the storyline is the best thing about this movie and also the breaking bad atmosphere had an amazing effect to this masterpeise by vince gilligan El Camino is really good but I can't help but feel a little disappointed. Maybe I was hoping to see more of how Jesse was going to integrate into a new life rather than tying up loose ends which didn't feel necessary.<br/><br/>The trailer also set me up for disappointment as there was so much speculation around what things meant and when they actually happened it was just pretty pointless.<br/><br/>We all know Jesse, we know what he's been through and constantly showing us what came before really takes time away from showing us what could happen next.<br/><br/>I'm at the end of the film feeling like I was at the end of Breaking Bad and the question hasn't changed. Whats next? I think the original ending was more satisfying than this , poorly written unfortunately A truly wonderful Breaking Bad fan experience. I cried at the end. Experience it yourself! For fans of the series this is a welcome return to some beloved characters and the flares of style BB is known for. Taking Jessies cliff hanger furthering that. In an unsurprising way. Really wanted to love it but it shows while Jessie was a great character ( and despite being a main and central character) BB was not his story, being more a as he was the contrast for Walt, nor could it ride on his shoulders. Personally I'd rather left it at the series end with Jessies destiny unknown driving off. I'm not all against further BB story mind you as I have enjoyed Better Call Saul. Other two fantastic episodes for this epic series. Great Aaron Paul! Great Gillian! While El Camino may not be the most ambitious film in the world, or the most ground-breaking, it fulfills it's purpose perfectly. Do not go into this film expecting it to be the glorious return of Breaking Bad, or to have some twist that changes the way you watch Breaking Bad, rather this film serves as a simple and concise epilogue to Breaking Bad. Vince Gilligan knew what this was and how to make this smaller story and conclusion to Jesse Pinkman's character. The film is solid all the way throughout and expands on Jesse's character and the events which happened to his character towards the end of Breaking Bad. There is no big twist, there is no big reveal, this is purely and simply the conclusion to one of Television's best characters. This is not the big finale to Breaking Bad some expected it to be, that was made all the way back in 2013, this rather, is a simple epilogue to Breaking Bad which should please most Breaking Bad viewers and fans. My 3 stars are based only on some cool scenes, nothing else. And I hate giving it 3 because Breaking Bad is my all time favorite show.<br/><br/>So...
Was it fun for the crew and actors to meet up again and make this movie? Yes, Im sure it was.
Was it fun to see some of the characters again? Yeah, kinda. Although it never gave me the chills. Actually it didnt give me much at all, to be honest.
Did the movie answer any questions I might have had after the show ended? Not at all.
Did the move make any sense at all? Nah, not really.
Was it a good movie? Well, if you havent watched the show it makes no sense at all watching this movie. However, it didnt make much sense to me either, so just give it a shot, and then watch the show. To answer the question, not its not a good movie either way.<br/><br/>There are some amazing shows out there, and I get it - both the fans and the creators and actors are really sad its over. But its like having the greatest party ever and then trying to redo it the next weekend. It never works. Just let it go and remember what was.<br/><br/>This movie was not needed. After watching the whole series 7 times, I was expecting something magnificent or at least on par with the series. El camino was a huge disappointment for me and my kids. Jesse without Walt is like pepper without salt; it does not work.
Todd was unrecognizable and the old characters which we love featured fleetingly.
There just seemd to be no plot, just Jessie on the run from the authorities and a pointless wild west shootout in the end.
It left me wondering what the hell did I just watch? After all the build-up this was a huge letdown. Netflix has a way of paying big money to make mediocre movies it seems.<br/><br/>For the first third of the movie I was thinking this wasn't bad scene-setting, then around halfway through it dawned on me that this was the actual plot.<br/><br/>We see a lot of Todd, who is a well drawn character, but does anyone think it's a good idea for the one and only Breaking Bad follow-up to spend a whole lot of time looking at Todd? It served to explain where Jesse was looking for money, and to set up one scene in which Jesse realizes how broken he is, but it was too drawn out and tangential.<br/><br/>Badger and Skinny Pete seemed like a parody of themselves, speaking lame lines with "" stuck on the end to remind you that these guys were funny in Breaking Bad. And why would Jesse flee right back to his former buddies? Surely that's a dumb move. Why were there no police watching their place? They'd know who he associated with. So that was all there just to shoehorn some old favorite characters into the movie it seems.<br/><br/>The main showdown with some randoms in a welding shop was contrived and implausible. Suddenly Jesse is a wild west sharpshooter who just scares half the gang away with his awesomeness. And then there was an unexplained and gratuitous explosion, just for the sake of having a shot where Jesse sits in the car with stuff exploding behind him. A pale imitation of some Breaking Bad scenes I guess.<br/><br/>And then there were flashbacks with Walter, Mike and Jane that served conspicuously little purpose except to boost up the cast list and help sell the movie. And then suddenly it's the end.<br/><br/>It actually surprised me to see that this was written and directed by Vince Gilligan. Perhaps he's not the genius he seemed to be, or perhaps he had a better team first time around, or perhaps Netflix constrained his creativity, or perhaps he has lost interest and needed cash. Who knows. It's a shame they made this.<br/><br/>That said, Better Call Saul is an excellent Breaking Bad spinoff. Way better than this lame movie. Had zero substance, scenes (such as the Walter White scene) that lasted far too long and were virtually pointless. Director of this movie did a really poor job. Absolutely gutted as I was looking forward to this movie and in truth, it's up there with the 2 worst movies I've ever watched. If you like the actors then great but if you like to actually watch a good movie I'd recommend going watching paint dry as it would be more entertaining. No story line, no direction and no substance. Really poorly written movie.... #didntdotheshowjustice Don't write many reviews these days, but decided I had to weigh in on this one.. If you've never seen the show, you will not like this movie. It's really just meant for the fans of the show. And it's really nowhere as good as the show is. I'm not sure what Gilliam decided to come back to this franchise, but then again it was certainly pretty popular, though of course, I can't really say that there were any loose ends at its conclusion. Though, of course, the series was more about Walter White than Jessie Pinkman, however, one does have to admit that he was a pretty major character. What this film proposes to do is to look at what happened to Pinkman after Walter freed him and let him run off into the night.<br/><br/>One could say that this film is a bit of a retrospective on the series, though not a huge one - I certainly wouldn't consider it to be a clip show, though of course there are some flashbacks to the series, even if it wasn't the case that we saw that scene in the series. However, true to Gilliam's style, he does leave some hints in the film to suggest where it is going (not that he goes full-on Chekov's Gun here, because there does happen to be this tarantula that doesn't play a major role, except for people looking at it).<br/><br/>Well, one thing we learn is that Pinkman discovers that this guy, one of the neo-Nazi's that were holding him prisoner had a heap of cash hidden in his house. Of course, this guy is now dead, so Pinkman decides to go on a bit of a treasure hunt. Actually, it is a little more than that, namely because he certainly is being looked for, and sort of does need to get out of town, but certainly doesn't want to leave without any money on him.<br/><br/>I guess much of it is about him trying to find, and get this money, and then only a short bit of where he leaves. He did happen to be pretty close to Walter White, despite them having a falling out at the end. Then again, one could see that Walter's attachment to Pinkman was eventually going to get him into trouble.<br/><br/>This film is quite a lot slower paced than the series, but on the other hand, the series was pretty slow-paced as well. In a way, the series had some pretty tense moments, but it also had some pretty quiet and easy-going moments as well. This is the case with this film. In fact, some have suggested that it is two more episodes of Breaking Bad, though the focus here is more on Pinkman than on anybody else.<br/><br/>A couple of new characters are introduced, but the thing is that considering most of the characters had been developed over the five seasons of the series, it was pretty hard to have all that much depth to them. Still, the film itself wasn't that bad at all, and as I suggested, it is pretty laid back and relaxed. Yeah, I liked it, and it is worth watching, though of course only if you have actually seen the series. I know everyone loves Breaking Bad and all things surrounding it, with good reason. It was a good show, for the most part. But a lot of people I know don't want to admit that there were some real stinkers when it came to episodes and even characters.
This movie makes a decent addition to the episodes but if you are thinking it's going to be some epic emotionally impactful episode (you know the ones, like when they kill of a main character or something else as equally astounding) you are going to be dissapointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong these guys know what they are doing when it comes to writing and there is a ton of characters and nods to the original show to keep you satisfied. I am not sure if I had never seen it if it would have had any more impact on me than if I hadn't. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad then you will probably enjoy it for what it is, an extension of Jesse's getaway from the end of the show. This movie is decent at best, not as good as the show, I was afraid when I heard netflix was producing it and my fears have been confirmed.. When I rated the Breaking Bad Series on IMDb, I rated it a 10 because it is one of the best drama series that has ever been on TV. I am a HUGE fan. But if you put that aside and judge this movie by its merit alone... I only score it a 6. It just was not that good. To compare apples to apples, you have to compare it to the excellent series. But this piece as just a movie? meh...<br/><br/>Some of the reasons the movie is lacking where the series didn't is the pacing and editing. In the series, each episode was very well paced and tight. The movie seemed too long. It dragged in several spots and even got boring at times. The parts that were good, were very good. However, there were several parts that could've been sped up or completely taken out and it would not have affected the movie at all. I give props for using all the characters the way they did, but some really didn't lend anything to the story. It was just filler to stick their face in there and have the audience go, "Hey! There is so-and-so!" It worked, but if you remove a few of those scenes altogether, it would not have mattered. Had it been edited down to an hour or an hour and a half and tightened up a bit, it would've been great because some scenes and sequences were very good. But there were too many parts that were just too slow for dramatic effect and it didn't work. It makes sense why they did a movie. You can't make it an hour and do just one TV episode. But two hours was not the answer either.<br/><br/>So I score it a 6 and give credit for the great acting, good story and the good "tense" scenes. But take off 4 for the slow scenes, dreadful pacing and bad editing. It's a shame because I really wanted to like it and was very excited to see it. By the end, I was rather disappointed. It seemed to have potential for so much more. It was very hard to see Jesse being mistreated, dismissed, manipulated and paying for other people's bad choices. My heart broke a little every time I saw him being kicked (literally and metaphorically) like a dog throughout the series as I always saw him as a child in a grown man's body, acting all tough when in fact he is soft and kind hearted. And he payed for that as a martyr. Seeing him getting out and taking his life in his own hands, starting new, is all I wanted to see, and that's what I got. Series ended perfectly, but now, with this, we have a REAL closure and a proper, perfect good bye. I don't know what people expected, but this is what I expected. Jesse finally becomes a criminal, what he'd try to for four seasons and disapointed during the fifth season.
I think the secound point of making this movie was to build the chance of arron's presence in bcs final season! Six years after the end of the already cult-breaking crime series "Breaking Bad", Netflix has decided to revive this story and present a film that would provide important answers to the rather ambiguous and not very clear ending of the series which shocked many fans. So this hidden project turned out to be El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.<br/><br/>The story of the full-length movie revolves around the Chevrolet El Camino vehicle which Jesse Pinkman used to runaway, where his life ended at that moment when Walter White decided to "retire" from his profitable business in an ancient and tried-and-tested way. And now Jesse has to adjust to a situation that can cost him a lot (I could have written this differently, but I don't want to "spoil" those, who haven't watched the series yet).<br/><br/>I think the most important question many people ask is - is it worth watching a movie if you haven't watched the series? My answer would be, yes, it is possible because the movie looks quite self-contained due to the way it is presented, but you can only enjoy it if you've watched the series because the heroes were close to you and the situations make you feel a bit nostalgic for the show itself.<br/><br/>Now about the movie itself. I really don't want to leave any "spoilers" because that would just wrong for the people who haven't watched the movie yet. The story is closely linked to the main show, which gives us a great deal of response to episodes that weren't fully developed in the final season. However, if we reject the television show itself, the tape provides quite serious entertainment, as the topics covered here make the actors' actions and their attitudes towards the situation understandable. Those situations can once take them to the edge of the abyss. So we also get some social topics to think about.<br/><br/>The film itself leaves a good impression after the screening, as it is not some banal narrative that has been written due to the popularity of the series, but rather a well-written story about current topics that should not leave anyone indifferent. At least in the US for sure. Only one con would be that everything is going too fast, so it would take a few more episodes or just a mini-series of 8-10 series to enjoy what the film's creators showed. But for the end... Applause while standing up.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are charismatic just like in the series, so there is no less sympathy for Jesse than for his performance in the five seasons of "Breaking Bad". There are also a few familiar heroes from the series who have been featured in the trailer to add the wholeness so that we viewers can once again find ourselves in this merciless world of drug traffickers and drug addicts.<br/><br/>Technically, the film does go down well with the series - music, makeup, hairstyles and costumes, locations, camera work, video and audio montage and scenery - it just looked so great. As there were no moments feeling like you were watching the series again.<br/><br/>As for the actors - Aaron Paul is still as cool as he was eleven years ago when the series first hit television. The film again featured the same Jesse we loved so much. His dramatic performance, in my opinion, was even better than some episodes in the series itself. Other featured actors you could see were Jonathan Banks, Robert Forster, Charles Baker, Jesse Plemons.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a great tribute to the fans of the series and a high quality movie (epilogue), that is worth watching solely for the sporting interest. "NETFLIX" is finally back again with a good and serious full-length project. Ties most things up. One of the few good additions to the dc universe Breaking Bad dealt in the drug empire business, while El Camino deals out bite-sized, re-packaged nostalgia. Re-visiting the universe more than half a decade after Walter White's final demise, there are familiar traces that immediately come to mind. There are callbacks to the same brand of humour, some gratuitous (Magnets!), and some revealing (I totally graduated high school, d**k - Walt's faux-praise deflating into condescension). And there is a brief trip into the desert that recalls the magnificent photography of the original, the dusty vistas and desolates landscapes of Albuquerque setting the tone of the neo-western, a landlocked den of crime and filth. In fact, it's a little too brief; El Camino teases glimpses of Breaking Bad at its peak, but fails to understand that what made the show great couldn't possibly be re-captured in a two hour Netflix special.<br/><br/>The original had a measured, almost glacial pace. You don't just watch one episode of Breaking Bad. Sure, they may have been self-contained, but the story unfolded gradually as a slow burn, allowing us to witness the full measure of man transforming from high school chemistry teacher to drug kingpin, the finale expending six years of nervous energy and gut punch after gut punch. Here, Jesse ambles from location to location at the same pace, but the runtime works against him. Gilligan's style is ever present, every scence punctuated with tension (see the match cut in the shower where Jesse's PTSD suddenly strikes), with the soundtrack promoting an ambient, anxious churning, but it's too little and too soon. The feature resembles two episodes clumsily squished together, with excessive screentime devoted to flashbacks that press Jesse to relive his trauma, but barely enough for him to be able to drive off into the sunset a changed man (Jesse Plemons' casual sociopathic shtick wears a little thin as it eventually did in the show, and pales in comparison to some of his work post-show, now that we recognise his talent from Fargo and Black Mirror).<br/><br/>Only one fleeting moment bursts with the original Breaking Bad DNA, a never-before-seen recollection of the aftermath of 4 Days Out, immediately following Walt and Jesse's return from the dilemma in the desert. It only takes a second for the audience to re-calibrate, and then we know exactly where the pair stand. The flashback is a great cross-section of Walter White on the precipice of Heisenberg in late season two. Cranston is pitch perfect as always, still stuck in his early teaching mannerisms, a stilted attempt at small talk and college aspirations masking his deeper desires; he is on the verge of greatness. And Jesse? He barely registers the ambition and ego brimming from the man across the faded diner booth, too busy chowing down a salad. He assures Walt that his family will get every cent that is coming to them, and we believe him.<br/><br/>Where did that Jesse Pinkman go, anyway? A true fan recognises that Walter White died well before the final season, but for Jesse it was a much bumpier ride. Where is the Jesse so consumed by his own conscience that he berates a support group willing to absolve his sins? One life taken - Gale Boetticher - was enough to torture him over multiple seasons, but the Jesse of El Camino is okay with gunning down welders because they have been set up as sleazy and complicit in his imprisonment (actually, only one of them). How could the writer who penned Walter White's rise and fall resort to this? The show would weep at this lazy moralising, as if hiring a Hummer full of strippers condemns you to murder by protagonist. The final showdown, steeped in classic western iconography, is more cool than compulsory, turning him into a veritable Man with No Name. You almost expect him to spin his duel pistols around his trigger fingers and holster them with a tip of his cowboy hat, and then drive off without so much as glancing back at the explosions (oh wait, he does do that). Breaking Bad was never 'cool'; Walter was meant to be feared, not admired, although a large portion of the fanbase never truly realised this. In El Camino, Jesse finally gets his chance of a fresh start, which was the very least he deserved, but not like this. Overall the movie seemed okay but it wasent a big wow for me, it felt empty.. After 6 years since final series I would've expected something more captivating and memorable. As a huge fan of the Breaking Bad series who holds to the statement throughout all this years that Breaking Bad is the best TV show of all time, I can say this movie has been hugely overrated by the hard core BB community. It is slow paced which was expected in sort of ways, but the problem is that it is way to slow, it makes you wanting the movie to end. The cinematography is off the charts, it is one of the most amazing pieces of directing I have ever seen in my life, but apart from that, it offers nothing else. What the hell happened with Skinny Pete anyway? How is Heisenberg's family? What are they going to do with the money? Was the Jesse's happy ending all we got? Personally, I expected way way more, can't say the movie is a flop, but certainly it is not a worthy Breaking Bad sequel. Damn shame they didn't do something interesting and mindblowing, watching this movie for 2 hours was like watching a bottle episode of breaking bad. Sorry folks but if you're expecting to see something new and exciting....... you won't. While to me "Breaking Bad" already had a truly perfect end to its story in the series finale. I felt the last shot of Jesse driving off into the night was a perfect end to his character as it left a nice satisfying mystery as to where he will go. This movie was not completely neccesary however it is definitely a satisfying watch as it has some beautiful callbacks some touching moments and some great cameos from the show and some fantastic writing that only vince gilligan could do. Watched it while cooking and cleaning. Did not care for it to begin with. The movie was good don't get me wrong, the plot was ok but I still don't get why they did it though, nothing revealing or exciting happened. People are expecting too much from this movie. this movie is a good bye to jesse pinkman and nothing else and i expected it to be the same.
but some people are expecting it to be a all suspense and action series like Breaking Bad. no it is not.. get over it moochers Aaron Paul was outstanding. Breaking bad is one of the highest rated series ever. However, I think they missed a few key characters, Skyler? Walt Jr? Marie? They should have told their after story also. I would say the audience would have preferred a short 3-4 episode series to cover everything everyone has ever wanted since the series ended. And obviously a bigger scene was needed for the big dog (Walter White). I would recommend for Breaking bad fans just to get some kind of closure. So, first things first, you definitely have to be a BB fan to enjoy and understand any of this movie. There is no way to come into this without having seen the entire series. Having said that, there was nothing necessarily wrong about it at all, nor do i think it was poorly done, I just view it as an epilogue to the entire series and not anything like a final act or anything. The story of BB was always about Walter White, so if anyone had any assumptions coming into this movie that there would be some sort of great revelation to WW's story, they are going to be disappointed. BB ended exactly how it should've of, with WW's death. Now, since Jesse was a main character but not THE main character, this was a nice sendoff for him. t was certainly interesting to see how he got away from his capture from Jack's gang and struggled with the memories of everything he went through. I didn't leave this thinking "wow" it was more like "ok that was nice."<br/><br/>My reference to Godfather 3 in the title is because Coppola has made reference that GF3 was always an epilogue to 1 and 2. You can watch the first 2 films without never having watched 3 and be totally satisfied with the story of Michael Corleone. GF3 is certainly not on the same level of the first 2, but it is a find film in its own right. I felt the same with El Camino. It was a nice ending to the Pinkman story, but didn't really add anything to BB. You can watch BB over and over again without ever having to watch El Camino and still be totally satisfied with the story. It's OK. It's not great and collapses into boredom for much of the film. The same story (really just a Jesse wrap-up) could have been conveyed in an hour or less. The long scenes are long for a reason - to fill time and make this feature-length. The best, most interesting characters and best acting come from Jesse Plemons (perfect psychopath), Charles Baker (his usual awesome Skinny Pete), and the incomparable Robert Forster. Aaron Paul stays true to the Jesse character insofar as he is in anguish most of the time, etc. to the point of sheer boredom. Worth a watch but not worth a "10" rating. If you've just recently binged Breaking Bad then this will be a good watch if you want a glimpse into what happened to Jesse at the end of the series. It is well crafted and the cinematography is first class.<br/><br/>However if (probably like most) you finished watching the epic series in 2013 then to try and get into this 'follow on / epilogue / sequel' you'll probably spend most of the time trying to remember what happened all those years a go; who's alive, what's with the cage, I thought they were dead etc..<br/><br/>Enjoyable to watch for nostalgia if nothing else, probably better to watch if you've recently binged the show and, if not, helpful to watch with Google to help fill in the blanks! There are no attempts of grandeur here, its a continuation of the final series of breaking bad. Whats impressive is how the theme and connection to the breaking bad universe remians to be a gripping and masterful lure. I felt like this was an extension of season 5 and thats all i wanted and expected.
It portrays the events after the final episode which was Walts send off and allows Jessie to have his own send off.
We learn what happened to Jessie in the time he was locked up under the protection of Todd and co. And more importantly we get to see the finishing tale to Jessies' story.
For me its Breaking bad its a prolonged episode yes but its gripping and engaging, its everything it needed to be. I'm completely 50/50 about this. It was lovely to see what happened to Jessy and see him get out but the film was crap! Boring & slow. The best thing about breaking bad was having moments of action where everything was high rate, didn't know what was going to happen. To a calmer more tense atmosphere and at that point you just listened. But this was just a long load of, is anything going to happen? Something peaked my attention about 2/3 the way through but I can't even remember what that was now. There are so many memorable moments from breaking bad I can't say this had the same effect. What drew everyone into the Breaking Bad Universe was Vince Gilligan's ability to take a slow pace, really flesh out his characters with great detail over time and know exactly when to hit those explosive moments that left you in absolute shock. El Camino, however, is a movie. And that same tonal consistency didn't work the same way for a short 2 hour three act story.<br/><br/>The greatest mistake by far was picking up where BB left off. 6 years has gone by since the last episode, which offers a great opportunity for Gilligan to set the movie in the present day and let us see the aftermath of Walter White's actions through the eyes of Jesse Pinkman. I don't think many fans were interested in the events immediately following Pinkman's escape, rather hoping to see a glimpse of the characters either moving on or permanently affected by Heisenberg.<br/><br/>All in all it was mediocre and dragged it's feet while only having a 2 hour timeframe as opposed to an entire season to allow for a slow burn.<br/><br/>All is not lost though, as there is more Better Call Saul to come, which has proven to be a surprising masterpiece of a spinoff. We can put this movie behind us as a small failure and look forward to the future. When I watched this movie I was amazed by how detailed everything was. Many people say it's a slow movie and that's one of the things that make it bad. Atleast it keeps it's speed throughout the movie instead of jumping around as other movies do. The movie itself is not supposed to add anything special to the story, it's just supposed to give us something nice to watch. What I would have wanted to see more of is Pete and Badger. I would also have wanted them to fix Todd as he was fat. Started off well and felt like it was building to something exciting in that breaking bad way, but then just went nowhere. It was like a 2 hour slow burning episode of BB, not a movie. Nice to know what happened to Jesse, but it could have been told in 5 minutes. Loved seeing Jesse ( Aaron Paul ) continue his journey..... it was no surprise to find him in a lot of trouble. Would like to know how he escaped his captors. The tension was full on and in parts I thought I was watching a David Lynch production when Jesse's minder was cranking mad......weird stuff.
So, Walter is definitely gone and Jesse is now in Alaska....... don't let's finish here.
"Bring it on" there is a whole new series waiting in the wings...... let's call it BLUE ICE ??? A largely unnecessary wrap on the Jesse Pinkman story. I found it a bit boring and, at times, silly. As a fan of the show I was disappointed. That said, it's still worth a watch. This was exactly the right tone , right level , a great addition to the cannon. Not a cash grab not ott fan service , just very enjoyable It's nice to see some of the BB characters and some of the nostalgia again. However, this movie isn't as spectacular as the old series was. It's more of a round up to provide a good ending for Jesse's storyline. It's not bad, but it feels a bit dragged out. The only thing bothering me about this movie is the ending. Jesse is going to survive the rest of his life on 250k? Seems a bit off to me. Walt did it a lot better with his barrel of 10 million. Why would you ruin the best series ever created with this disappointing sequel film?!<br/><br/>2 hours of boring and pointless scenes had me clock checking many times.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's masterclass in acting is the only saving grace in all of this. He made it watchable to the end, but I did have to stop and take a break a few times. I was hoping it would get better but sadly, it never did. And okay, fine, the cinematography was also good.. but there was just no plot. There was no real story behind the movie, just Jesse dragging his feet along the whole 2 hour stretch.<br/><br/>Stop creating sequels and spinoffs for no good reason!! A huge disappointment. What else can you say about V. Gilligan and cast. This movie was made for fans of the show but its still a stand alone film even if youve never seen the show. This film was a 10/10 and needs to be watched and taught in film schools. Breaking Bad is Vince Gilligan. Vince Gilligan is Breaking Bad. There's just no other way to put it. And anyone who knows George Vincent Gilligan Jr. also knows that he'll produce pure brilliance regarding anything and everything to which he sets his brilliant mind.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad the television show is often mentioned as being one of the greatest series of all time. Breaking Bad the movie should now be discussed in terms of being one of the greatest television-to-movie continuations of all time.<br/><br/>Nobody should be surprised. Gilligan wrote, directed, and produced 'El Camino.' Throughout the film's masterful puppetry of drama, humor, and violence, we know it's Gilligan who is lording over it all, deftly manipulating the marionette strings.
He's the reason why the show-and now the movie-exists as a tragicomedy that pirouettes at both ends of the tragedy-comedy spectrum. The same goes for David Chase's 'The Sopranos,' a show that similarly has its place on the Mount Rushmore of television. Perhaps Gilligan learned from Chase that humor makes the violence palatable and violence makes the humor essential.<br/><br/>Regardless, Gilligan put his legacy on the line by endeavoring to make 'El Camino.' In doing so, Gilligan doubled down, wagering everything on himself. The result? Gilligan won. Again. For as much as one could argue the lack of necessity in this films existence, it was a nice way to fully "close" the series and the best way I've heard it put as being an epilogue.<br/><br/>So, the closing chapter, as you might expect given its infinitely shorter run time than the series there's little in the way of action and offers more of an introspective dive into the character of Jesse, who frankly possesses the most depth on the shows entire roster. Bringing back into play a few old faces as well as tying off some loose ends Jesse's struggle to regain the person he once was is extremely interesting to see unfold with his physical state changing as he slowly re-emerges from his largely shaken state following his escape from the compound. With the goal of leaving town his final target, it was nice to be along for the journey as he finishes business before getting that clean slate to start afresh, eventually driving off to the Alaskan 'sunset' if you will leaving the past behind him.<br/><br/>Told largely in flashbacks to give a little context for actions in the present, it was nice to see the relationships in slightly more intimate levels between Jesse and Walter as well as his captor Todd as he frees his prisoners to help him for a weekend, at the ground level it really helps you understand the films events as much like 'Joker' which has recently released you get very little in terms of exposition or typical features which feed you information, as such relying on prior knowledge of the shows events to get the best experience from this. Boasting excellent production value and really nearly jumping through time to great emotional effect I'd say it's probably one of the years best even if it does contain a slightly camp and I'll fitting action sequence (you'll know it when you see it) but in all, totally worth a watch When we last saw Jesse Pinkman, he was driving off into the night, ravaged but free, his future unknown. Our final view of Jesse is of him once more driving off into an unknown future, though a more promising one. Have we learned much from what El Camino filled in between these two cinematic book-ends? In a plodding style we're given some additional context and motivation, but little of real substance. A great deal of time is spent on scenes that could have been much shorter and still made their point. We try not to be too distracted by the obvious ageing of the characters. Jesse Plemons seems to have put on 40lbs in a very short time, and Mr Pinkman looks plumper than a man kept in a concrete hole has any right to be. Walter makes the inevitable appearance, to so little effect that we might suspect it was a clip picked up from the Breaking Bad cutting room floor. The movie had its highlights and some suspense, the cinematography sharp and edgy and a good script. It seemed like a longer version of one of the few B- Breaking Bad episodes. Better than most, but not the riveting maelstrom that made Breaking Bad the Gold Standard of modern series. 9.5/10
Throughout the masterpiece "breaking bad" , we saw how and what Jesse (Aaron Paul ) went through , he really suffered and made us show sympathy to his character. After the astonishing , satisfying ending of breaking bad we thought it is the end , though we wanted Jesse to has his happy ending , and "elcamino" is the best thing can be done by the genius Vince , he gave us one of the best movies in 2019 . Why people saying they are disappointed? Some say we didn't see the ending with DEA or Skyler or Mike's granddaughter . This movie was just about Jesse we knew this we didn't expect to see more characters stories . Walter , mike , Gus died . Saul got his tv show . So it was perfectly done to concentrate on Jesse and how will it end with him .
I was over the moon when I saw Walter again one of the greatest characters in tv history , if not the best I wanted to see more of him . I did expect DEA chasing Jesse also I didn't think the trailer should have been that mystery.<br/><br/>All in all , the movie was dramatically great . MASTERPIECE You really have to appreciate the intricacies and details of the show to get into this. The sheer fact that Vince Gilligan and company got so many players in the tale of Jesse Pinkman to come back for this... And yes, Aaron Paul and Jesse Plemons are middle-aged and not spring chickens like their characters ought to be. This follow up is not a "popcorn" movie. It is slow. It is detail-oriented. It is the type of thing that is going to have to be re-watched a few times before it is truly recognized and appreciated. And it is very appropriate for Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman. The show may have started focused on Walter White. But, Aaron Paul turned it from a solo into a duet. The character, and fans of the character, deserved this resolution. This is a farewell to Jesse and not much. You wouldn't be able to show this to someone who hasn't seen Breaking Bad and expect them to 'get the film' or enjoy it. I like BB and I didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted to. It's probably because I expected too much and thought this would be a good standalone movie. Instead what we got is a gloried farewell to our beloved junkie.<br/><br/>I think it is shot better than a TV show but not quite as good as the top movies of today. The acting is good and consistent. The thing I don't get though is how fast Jessie got over his supposedly being traumatized.<br/><br/>Anyways, if you love Breaking bad and want to scratch that itch go and watch it. I really don't know where to start from, I wish I could watch this movie on the big screen. Anyway, the movie takes you back to the memory lanes of Breaking Bad, one of the best television shows ever made. The movie starts exactly where the show ended and the rollercoaster starts again.<br/><br/>It does not add anything more to the show but it just ends the show again without disappointing the fans. The filmmaking was pretty impressive and the cast did a very good job as always. It's for the fans of Breaking Bad so if you haven't watched the show, you just wouldn't enjoy it. Nothing amazing like we expected. For a movie that carried on from the final epsiosde of BB, it would've been nice to see a flashback of that final scene.<br/><br/>Jesse is on the run from the police yet we don't really see the police 'looking' for him except in one of the earlier scenes where police cars are going to Skinny Pete's home.<br/><br/>The best thing that did it for me is finally finding out that Walt actually died and that Jesse got the new start. I can't help but think the whole thing was more about Jesse getting money rather than him being on the run. Very fulfilling in the sense of recieving closure with Jesse. Had the same pace of the series. As a fan who's enjoyed viewing the series numerous time, seeing Walt one last time made it worth the 2 hours. Dont pay too much attention to the changed appearance of numerous characters or it might ruin it for you. Great ending. Please excuse fat Todd, as well as the obvious bald cap Bryan Cranston wears. I originally gave this a 6, but realized that Gilligan did what 95% of action movie director's couldn't do with the same formula. That to me is commendable.<br/><br/>I didn't think the pacing or action or dialogue or acting was bad, just not a lot was memorable to me. Maybe this movie was released too far from the show's ending. Maybe I just don't care about Jesse's story arc all that much.<br/><br/>Regardless, a solid movie for the formula it followed. My subjective rating sits at about a 6 though. While I was a bit hesitant on the idea of this film, I have to admit there was a lot more story left to be told. Seeing old characters return, some flashback sequences, and familiar story elements was satisfyingly entertaining. El Camino doesn't lessen or ruin the series but instead expands it in a way fans weren't expecting. True fans of Breaking Bad will enjoy this film and appreciate all the nuisances and callbacks it has to offer. The script and direction are close to perfect. Aaron Paul is wonderful. To the people who find El Camino boring I have only only one thing to say; get off your ritalin and start meditating, b****es. How do u follow up one of the 5 best TV shows of all time? No easy task, while El Camino does a respectable job, it falls short of the greatness of breaking bad.<br/><br/>The lack of time to tell a story in the same vein, combined with the lack of characters remaining from the main storyline means that the task was all but impossible.<br/><br/>El Camino had to resort to frequent flashbacks to tap into that starpower, but it wasn't in the same Breaking Bad 'let me guess' type of way. Overall it lacked suspence and action I was hoping for. Still a really good story, but not a great one. The whole thing is basically one long final episode, of what happens to end jesses story. That's really it. The flashbacks with Todd where a little unnecessary. One 45 minute episode would have sufficed. Good ending to Jesse story, but it's not anything new. Just "an extra episode" This movie thrust me back in time, to the edge of the seat gripping nights watching weekly on cable TV. It was ironic in that the movie is largely built upon the effects of drugs and addiction, and here I was feeling like watching this was somehow equivalent to injecting a really good dose (at least I imagine it would be). This film is also all about time, with a small insect making the connection between the same kind of bug Jessie once studied on a street corner until it was stepped on - here now, it was reborn. Same goes for Jessie Pinkman, wanting to shed his old self and memories as quick as the dirt running off his body after taking his first shower since captivity. Like the bug, he is reborn and unlike Saul Goodman and Walter White, it's clear he has no intention of coming back.<br/><br/>This catapulted me back to those magical nights and was a dream come true - to see Breaking Bad come alive again, if even for a short couple hours. I kept checking the progress meter in Netflix hoping it wasn't going too fast, but it was, always. It's a bit distractingðŸ¤£
But it's nice to revisit the characters. Although many years late, I feel that this provides a much needed finale for Jesse.<br/><br/>It might have felt a bit misleading seeing as we didn't miraculously see Walt back again, but in all honestly, that one is on us.<br/><br/>Appreciate it for what it is, closure. The best way I can think to describe El Camino is it's simply an extra episode of Breaking Bad. And a pretty good one, too. Apart from Fat Todd, everything and everyone fits in amazingly well with what went before, and feels entirely cut from the same cloth.<br/><br/>If it does have a flaw, it's that it doesn't at any point tell us anything about any of the characters that we didn't know already. Also, the familiar faces from the past coming back as flashbacks didn't add anything new or important either.<br/><br/>But the basic plot and events within it are exciting and imaginative and perfectly realized in every way. And after the catastrophic end to Game Of Thrones and the completely useless Deadwood 'movie', just not ruining everything that came before it can seem a triumphant achievement in itself.<br/><br/>El Camino doesn't embarrass itself or the perfection of the longer story it belongs to, so I'm really glad that it exists and that I saw it. Yes ok it could have been better but overall it was a pretty good farewell.<br/><br/>Not amazing but a solid 8 from me. It's perfectly breaking bad. Just breaking bad. Perfect sync. It's like we got three more amazing episodes. A good ending to one of the best TV shows ever made.
In such a short time he went through Hell and we all rooted for him to get a break and have a better life, S5 ending wasn't enough I genuinely wanted to know what happened to him.
As always with BB there are "Why are you doing/not doing that?" moments and some are saying it's too long but it's basically two new episodes comprising of flashbacks and JP coping with life.
Jesse Plemons' Todd character is one of the greatest written psychopaths ever. The way I see it when a show as good as breaking bad ends the way it did. You can leave the unanswered questions that this film answers to viewers imagination. Having said that I'm really glad it was made and I will watch this again. Well done I was very much into the movie but the ending left me unsatisfied. It was more like the pilot of Breaking Bad's spin-off new series. It felt like was missing 45 to 1 hour more filming to be considered a complete and an excellent movie. This is a weird review for me. At first I didn't see a purpose for this movie. I felt that breaking bad ended how it should have. However after watching this I felt like the story had truly finished. Without going to into spoilers, this gave us closure to every character the end didn't and even gave us some more background on existing characters. Was it as explosive as the final season of breaking bad? No. But that wasn't the point, I truly believe that tone of this movie was more consistent than that final season and gave us an end to something amazing. The story does full justice to Jesse's character but the central idea maybe was not to add anything new to the movie, significantly. So overall the movie serves as a farewell and closure to what was left behind at the time of the finale to which the movie did fair justice. Seriously el camino. Made me cry and while watching it. You get disturbed also vince did a great job by putting bryan cranston in the last 20 minutes i love it. Thank you breaking bad It was a bit plain and simple imo. Expected more because waited for 5 years. Happy for Jesse. Overall, a good watch but I'm not fully satisfied They didnt spoil the end of breaking bad which was the most important thing, the best ending to a series. I think they gave Jesse justice. What's not to like. To do this movie years down line set straight after the series would be hard to do. People change, one in particular but if you can get past that it's a winner for me This movie is the perfect end to the arc of Jesse Pinkman. The insight on his time with Jack's gang was great and the way he deals with all the situations is also good.
Would have loved to see a tribute to Hank by the Dea since walt gave the coordinates. Also huge respect for Pete and Badger! The movie was absolutely fantastic and a perfect conclusion for Jesse. Honestly, I wish the movie was slightly longer so they could flesh out the villain characters more. I also wish they would've done more with Jesse and Brock because that part of the movie still was a little unresolved. I also enjoyed the technical aspects of the movie. The shooting and lighting was the style you aspect from Breaking Bad, but then they throw in some crazy shots that you would only see in the movie. Overall, great experience with this one El Camino was the perfect send off to the legendary character of Jesse Pinkman just as Walter White in his last episode titled "Felina" in the Breaking Bad series !<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan and the rest of the crew, once again does a fantastic job at providing the much needed closure that it deserved, since the last season of the show.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended for true fans of the series, especially those moments when you get acquainted with the familiar faces that made the show the greatest leader in the Crime/Drama Category !<br/><br/>Final Verdict from a true fan- El Camino is a MASTERPIECE in its own way and definitely keeps the legacy of BREAKING BAD totally alive for generations to come ! I really liked the movie and it did justice to breaking bad. It explored many aspects of Jesse but i think it lacked an emotional touch. The plot was good but IMO should have been better but before i watched it, I was pretty satisfied with Breaking Bad's finale. The only hole that needed to be filled in the finale was Jesse's fate, El Camino's story was everything it needed to be and gave Jesse a satisfying closure but it lacked the intensity and high stakes of Breaking Bad!<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie with a good ending. (8.5/10) Good movie of great tv show and sweet and satisfied ending from the sadist one Walter had his ending and now we have Jesse's. And as Walter's ending, this one also takes its time. It's not fast-paced, it's grounded just like the series Breaking Bad. Aaron Paul's performance is like he never stopped playing his character Jesse. It's great to see him back in this role and play it so well. This may be his best performance to date.<br/><br/>We see cameos of the series all throughout the film. But the great thing is they don't feel like fan service, they're there to move the story along. And Vince Gilligan did a wonderful job picking which ones to revisit and which ones to leave out. We see them interacting with Jesse present time and also in flashbacks. I'm not a big fan of flashbacks, most of the time in other films they just feel unnecessary. Here they have a purpose at least. And I appreciate that.<br/><br/>Verdict, this movie did a great job closing a character's journey. Thank you Vince for letting us know what happens to Jesse after the events of Breaking Bad. If you have seen the series and have doubts of this movie, don't. You will be pleased to know that the movie is a great continuation and end to one of the greatest supporting characters on the small screen. I feel like this film will dissapoint some fans, not because it's bad but because it's a different style of film, it didn't have those quirky moments like in the city or the dark humour that really made Breaking Bad what it is, however, what it lacked in comic value made up for it in a gritty story for Jesse after been held prisoner.<br/><br/>I personally really enjoyed it and I think people who appreciate Jesse's story from the series will enjoy this because he was the guy we was rooting for in Breaking Bad<br/><br/>Solid 8/10 I'm convinced Vince Gilligan is jesus of TV and Film, while not as good as Breaking Bad (how can it be Breaking Bad is such a high bar that it'd be basically impossible) it's about on par with Better Call Saul perhaps a bit better, it's not a short movie, and it's not a overly long movie, it's a great length (even if I wish it would have been longer but that's just me wanting more of everything Breaking Bad). For anyone who preferred the action of BB will probably be a bit more disappointed, this movie captures the drama of BB, it's also very depressing with many longing callbacks to unseen parts that took place during BB including Jane (which if you remember is one of the few women Jesse actually loved).
I highly recommend watching it, if you're a fan of the drama of Breaking Bad you will love this movie, if you want action you're in the wrong place to begin with. Definetely not a masterpiece, but it is a great movie and more than that, it's a well achieved culmination of the Jesse Pinkman story. It could've gone very bad but i'd say it went very well. I gave it a 9, but more for nostalgia than anything else. There was not enough Skinny Pete and Badger in the movie. The flashbacks were ok, but kind of silly since the actor who plays Todd has put on so much weight since Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Also Vince missed an opportunity by saying Walter White was found dead in the television news report. Should have said he was in the hospital in critical condition. Never know what kind of story could have been written onto that later. An interesting prison series perhaps. Maybe I just miss Breaking Bad a bit too much..shrug. I was extremely sceptical of this film. I thought the series ended perfectly and that anywhere they did would detract from the series. No, I did not like Better Call Saul.
This felt like a Breaking Bad nostalgia trip and not in a bad way. The cameos seemed well-timed and well thought out. The clever set-pieces are back, so are the intelligent character moments. Aaron Paul gives his usual strong performance, and Jesse was given his due send off.
One might argue it was ultimately unnecessary and that may be true - the series ended strong after all. But as a welcome good trip down memory lane, it landed happily and never lagged and was never predictable. For what it was it could not have been better.
However, I cannot give a 10/10 for something that could do no more that round off an already rounded off TV series. Maybe some will point out that it is just an anthology of every major BB character dragged onto set for their five minutes of "remember this guy" and then disappear. I agree, but personally I cannot fault it for its execution. Breaking Bad had ended sadly. I'm glad Jesse was saved in the movie. It was also fun to see the old characters. Everything was the same, except for Todd's weight. To be honest, I was fine with the ending that Jesse had in "Felina", but this movie was definitely nice. There were some interesting flashbacks that help us understand just how awful was Jesse's experience as Uncle Jack's slave, those scenes were sad and terrifying, I felt so bad for Jesse. Apart from those scenes, there were some flashbacks that tie into the main theme of the movie, Jesse's future, Jesse's Camino.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography was exactly what we would expect of a Breaking Bad Movie, just excellent.<br/><br/>This was just a farewell for Jesse Pinkman, we can finally stop the speculation about what was his destiny. As the character that suffered the most in Breaking Bad, I think he had a very good ending. I know he is still been traumatized by his old memories, but he is finally free. Free of the business, free of Uncle Jack and his crew and free of Heisenberg. I asked myself "Does this need to continue as a movie after a brilliant finale?". But after watching, it totally is a needed movie to conclude Jesse Pinkman's character. It felt like 2 long & entertaining episodes for me rather as a movie. Cinematography was great. This totally concludes Breaking Bad saga and Vince Gilligan knows how to end things perfectly without plotholes. A must watch film for Breaking Bad fans! I thought the movie was perfectly done . I wouldn't change one thing about it . The acting , music and editing were phenomenal. VG is a genius and I wish that we will get another spin off / limited tv series containing elements from breaking bad universe. Aaron Paul was spot on with his character even after 6 years . Perfect ending to jesses and the breaking bad story I can understand if people are disappointed by this. In the last few months the hype for this movie has been outrageous. This is obviously no surprise, it is still a spin-off to arguably the most beloved television show of all time and deals with one of the fan favorite characters of it. So, maybe people are expecting heads to explode, meth to be cooked, automatic machine guns, train heists or stuff.<br/><br/>But I honestly am glad that El Camino is a small & quiet farewell. You might even say it is not really eventful. There isn't much action, there even isn't much dialogue. It focusses on low key moments and it perfectly uses flashbacks and new in-BrBa-footage to set up smaller plot points to follow.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there are still obviously scenes that make my Breaking Bad heart pound, I wouldn't call them fan service, but they achieved what fan service should achieve. And of course there are easter eggs to find in it.<br/><br/>Jesse is free, he finally is. It's very bad movie in my opinion , because it's not have action and wheout walter white the movie it's very very bad Absolutely nothing redeeming about this film. Nothing of interest happens and it in no way expands on the series. Direction and storyline = awful, anyone that thinks this is a decent follow up to the last series of breaking bad is clearly deluded. Anyone that thinks this is a good sequel doesn't appreciate any of the qualities that made breaking bad one of the best TV shows of all time. Jesse doesn't look like Jesse, act like Jesse, feels like Jesse. Much fuller face after months of starvation in a cage isn't helping to connect with the "old" Jesse. Acting feels forced and "over the top" at times. Aaron just could not pull the "old" Jesse.
I don't need to say much about Todd, see for yourself.
Empty dialogues, irrelevant senes, characters and ZERO action. I quit watching after the vacuum guy had refused to help Jesse. I predicted that the rest of the movie would be about finding $1,800. I wasn't wrong (after reading some comments). #FAIL
What on earth were they thinking doing this movie? Horrible script. Horrible story. Horrible twist on all characters Useless story line damaged the legacy created by breaking bad.
Movie is supposed to be fast paced not like episode of a series. Slow - pointless - boring - not at all satisfying. Save your precious life moments for something else. Boring plot nothing new so many unnecessary scenes, as a fan of bb at least director show us where he goes but in a Minnor way, boring Vince Gilligan is a genius the movie was so great that it made the aeries even look better the script was just like any other breaking bad episode the only thing missing was telling us that Gretchen and Elliot did give the money to Walt's family but we already know they will definitely a 10/10 thank you Netflix and thank you Aaron Paul Absolutely nothing happens for the first hour and forty minutes or so. Jesse Pinkman eventually shoots a couple guys, gets all the money, and retires to Alaska. I just saved you two hours.<br/><br/>Seriously, what the hell happened to Vince Gilligan?! Did he fall and hit his head or something? I loved Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul is great as well. This "movie" had NOTHING going for it. Unbelievably bad. This movie is basically an extra episode of breaking bad. I honestly didn't love the tv show but I found it a lot better than this. This "movie" was incredibly slow, really nothing happened that couldn't be summed up in under a minute, and overall the ending just wasn't worth a 6 year wait, or even the two hour runtime to get through this show. The big question that this movie is supposedly trying to answer is 'can Jesse live with his past and move on?', well we got no answer. He changed his identity and drove off in a car, just when you might actually get an answer to that question the credits roll. This show shouldn't have been brought back if it had nothing to add. Great ending of the story. I'm glad he got away and got second chance. <3 I'm not disappointed I'm un-surprised really. When i heard that BB is gonna be a movie i told my self what possibly gonna be added it's just perfect! We accept the fact that it's not always rainbows and butterflies! or apparently not all of us do ( according to the madness reviews here! ) you could have just leave it be!<br/><br/>Well, as i thought nothing new was added and u just fixed a story that didn't need fixing really. This movie is a pointless movie in the BB line. BB is my all the time favorite show i can't even enjoy most series now coz i compare it to it.<br/><br/>At least u didn't ruin the BB legacy. Sorry BB no 10 stars this time. El Camino is a boring money-grab. There isn't anything that happens in the movie that fans of Breaking Bad had to see. The story is a continuation of the series in spirit only. Other than the characters, nothing is the same. Nothing that made the show great appears in the movie. I never thought I'd see the day that Jesse Pinkman gets plot armor. There is never any doubt that there will be a happy ending. It's a cookie-cutter redemption story. I was having high hopes but it turned out to be a dud. It seem good writers have taken onto themselves to write bad.<br/><br/>Not worth your while. Not a breaking bad movie, just a bad movie. I loved the series and was gutted when it finished. It left a hole in my life that no other series has since filled. But this film is slow and dull. It lacks the magical bounce of characters that made the series so unique. Without Walt, it's nothing. Jesse can't fill a show. Massive disappointment I set out to write something about this film but couldn't think of anything. You saw all you needed to see in the series, and adding another episode to the completed story was unnecessary to say the least. I know, money talks in Hollywood, and some folks really felt like "saying farewell to Jesse Pinkman" for some weird reason, but it's the wait for something really exciting and special that absolutely kills this particular attempt to wrap "Breaking Bad" for good. No grand gestures, no sudden moves or unexpected twists. Just a tribute to the silliness and psychopathy that allowed Vince Gilligan to drag this thing for five seasons. Amen. Not what In expected. This movie is far from the level of the tv show, not giving any big answer nor putting any cliffhangers.
You got easily distracted from the story. Really disappointing Had it's moments, but had far to much filler of previous scenes from various episodes..It's more of a highlights episode with some additional scenes.
I'm sure greatly appealing to the BB junkie.. Enjoyed the TV series but by the end of the series I was glad when it came to an end as it couldn't go on much more & EL Camino only proves it was right to finish when it did. Last 20 minutes was the best of all. I really hope it's the end & they don't decide to milk it any more. The trailer was more entertaining than the actual movie. Stick to that... Should have been called... 'El Camino: A Boringly Bad Movie'<br/><br/>Incredibly predictable - one was hoping for some new, exciting outcome and resolution, but this was seriously lame!<br/><br/>Better luck next time... maybe 'Breaking Bad 3' will restore the devotion. Breaking Bad was a masterpiece. The reason it was a masterpiece is because of how well it walked the line between leaving it up to your imagination and explaining enough that you aren't clueless. Explanation is the sacrilege of the movie/media industry. It is the thing that sequels/prequels and other sorts of spinoff nonsense are built upon. Explanation like this movie serves only the fatten the bottom line. Breaking Bad tied up enough loose ends that you could form your own ideas about how things went down. Jessie drove off into the distance, on the run from the cops. We didn't need a movie about him running from the cops to take an educated guess about how it would play out. Let's be real, if Vince was planning for Jessie to fall easily into to police custody, he would have just included that in the finale to begin with. As for Walter White, do you really need somebody to tell you his fate? I mean the guy was bleeding out on the floor last we heard from him, so he is most likely dead or in custody fighting for his life. He definitely didn't have the juice to continue running from the cops.<br/><br/>This movie has quality acting but that can't make up for its fundamental flaw. It does not have a purpose for existence other than to besmirch Breaking Bad through needless over-explanation. It's another hit for those clinically addicted to the exhilarating masterpiece that was Breaking Bad, but the high is brief and leaves a feeling of unwelcome closure. This movie insults the former idea of breaking bad. Honestly find something better to spend your night Summary: An ill-conceived and unnecessary epilogue to an otherwise stellar series. It's two hours better spent doing something else.<br/><br/>Don't know what was on Vince's mind with this one, maybe Netflix waving all that money around to boost their own subscriptions had done thing to do with it. Overextended to say the least, this movie could have simply been condensed into the series finale. It's a movie that certainly didn't need to be made.<br/><br/>Most of the main characters have aged since the series ended. It was rather distracting to remain focused on the story line while noticing how *old* everyone is, while reminding yourself that the action takes place *right at the end of the series.* Really slow and quite boring compared to the series it lacked good pace and story telling "El Camino" directly picks off where we left off by the end of "Felina", the series finale of "Breaking Bad". Walter White died after exacting revenge upon the Welkers, saying goodbye to his wife, and making arrangements
for the better of his son. Jesse Pinkman drove off in an El Camino to an uncertain future, and we as the viewers can only hope that he drives off to a fresh start. But a potential journey to freedom will not be as easy, and is the center story in "El Camino". What "Felina" was to Walter White's story, "El Camino" is the Jesse Pinkman's counterpart.<br/><br/>The film is less explosive than "Felina" and is slower-paced and calmer, giving us a deeper look into Jesse Pinkman, his motivations, and learning what he has gone through. I think this is perfectly fine because Jesse has always been a more sympathetic character as compared to Walter White. "Breaking Bad" had chronicled the downfall of Walter White as his inner desires to be recognized for his genius-intellect and longing to be in a position of power gradually comes to full effect ever since he adopted the alias Heisenberg. Jesse Pinkman is the exact contrast, and while he had been in the drug business before White, he feels out of place and learns that he's just not fit to be in the harsh and cruel reality, and by the end of the series, he just wants to get out of it. Yet, he gets pulled back in over and over again, through Walter's manipulation, and suffers heaps of hardships, suffers lots of loss, and continually reaches a new low in his life. As a viewer, you can't help but hope that he finally gets his new start.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of "Breaking Bad", and have also watched "Better Call Saul", thus I have a pretty good understanding of who the people are in the "Breaking Bad" universe. While a standalone movie, "El Camino" would not be very effective for the uninitiated because some of the moments in the movie do have a huge impact, but because they cite particular references to the original series. Therefore, any fan of the series will find this movie hugely satisfying, given their familiarity with the material. But casual viewers won't find this movie to make much sense because it doesn't feel very coherent without its ties to the original series. It's not a particularly new story arc for Jesse Pinkman, it's an epilogue to his story.<br/><br/>Lastly, Aaron Paul delivers a powerful performance as Jesse Pinkman, as always, as what you'd expect for a man who won 3 Emmy awards for this role. He does an amazing job of portraying the pain, the snarkiness, the desperation, and loneliness of a young man who finds himself a victim of a cruel world he got himself into. Besides Paul, the rest of the cast did an amazing job, and for the actors who reprised their roles from the movie, it was such a delight to see them all back, which I'm sure fans will appreciate. One actor's physical presence felt a bit noticeably different (6 years is a long time) but never mind that because "El Camino" is just amazing.<br/><br/>So long, Jesse Pinkman. First, I think I should mention that I LOVED the TV series "Breaking Bad". In fact, I just finished watching the entire series for the first time yesterday. The ending of the last episode, while a good conclusion, did have me wonder what the fate would be for the Jesse Pinkman character. So you can imagine that the next day I would watch this follow-up movie that promised to answer that question. While I didn't think that this movie quite reached the brilliance of the television series, I do think that it was solid for the most part, and it ended things on a satisfying enough note. I admit that I did have a few quibbles with the movie. First, though I know that the focus here was on Jesse, I was hoping that there would be some follow-up with the family members of Walter White, but that didn't happen. (Though maybe it was a bit too soon after the events of the last episode of the series for this to happen.) Second, while I was never bored with this movie, I do admit that I did find it somewhat slow and stretched out at points. But as I said, the movie was never boring, managing at the same time to believably illustrate what the fate of the Jesse Pinkman character was. The series' deep drama and touches of black humor are also here. Viewers who loved the series and are prepared for a sometimes slow journey should enjoy this movie well enough. Many people have been saying El Camino is more of an extended episode of Breaking Bad; a television movie, rather than a normal movie. To an extent I agree with this, but "an extended episode" doesn't truly give justice to what this really is. This a Breaking Bad special. A follow-up special to the television show, which most of us either already knew, or are suddenly realising, is the greatest series ever made.<br/><br/>Just like the series, El Camino follows compelling characters, within a compelling (but grounded) world, with the same distinctive style/atmosphere which made the show so iconic. The only difference is that the stakes are higher and the aspect ratio is more cinematic. Other than that, it's Breaking Bad, my friends.<br/><br/>If you didn't like Breaking Bad, or you liked it, but you wanted something bigger and different, then you won't enjoy this film. El Camino might not be the Breaking Bad special we all wanted, but I think it is the one we all needed. Not a clue in the world how anyone could have NOT enjoyed this movie. It was quite good and exactly what the story needed for conclusion. What else could you possibly want to have seen? We got to see everything Jesse and it was perfect! The movie it's self was great, the ending could have had a bit more to it, but overall was a good movie. First of all, can I just congratulate the whole cast and crew with the amazing cinematography that really gives a credit to the film with great acting and a great director by Vince Gilligan. This film is not going to surpass the exquisiteness of Breaking Bad, nevertheless it gives us a great slow pace look into Jesses story from the past with his experiences along with trying to flee the country to finally get the life he deserves. This film takes the focus off Walt as we know he was left bleeding out on the floor at the end of Breaking Bad where Jesse drives off through the gate into the distance leaving Walt behind bleeding out finally being free with him and his El Camino to hit the road. We see a lot of familiar faces throughout this movie such as Mike, Badger, Skinny Pete just to name a few. You feel suspense throughout the whole movie hoping that Jesse does not get caught or even worse killed. There were a few comedic jokes in the film to make the viewers laugh, but overall it gives out a dark atmosphere as Jesse is literally running for his life. With some of the flashbacks into Breaking Bad where we see Jesse in a state of depression when he is forced to work for the Neo Nazis, showing the suffering pain that he was going through at that moment in time and being locked up in this cage pit, therefore you really get a look into Jesses mind in that moment. On the other hand we see Jesse in the flashback set in the times of Breaking Bad where he has a benevolent side to him, where Jesse does not want any violence he wants to get out of the drug business to sort his life out and maybe go to college/university where obviously that does not go to plan shown through the ending of Breaking Bad. This movie gives off the vibe as being slow pace yet dramatic more like a tribute to the astounding benevolent Jesse Pinkman, which it gives us Breaking Bad fans the closure that we need, therefore leaving us with a lovely happy ending to Jesses story that leaves you pleasantly surprised. Vince Gilligan did a phenomenal job of producing El Camino I give this movie a ten out of ten as it really does satisfy you with a really nice ending. It's not terrible but didn't really need to happen.
The acting and cinematography was great as you would expect but the story?
Nothing really happened. We didn't need closure after BB. The story ended well.<br/><br/>This was too slow and could have been wrapped up in a 45 minute episode. The story was- escaped-needed money- found money- escaped
The flash backs were ok and nostalgic but again, could have been better.
I'm glad I watched it but didn't change anything by doing so. Great to have the world of breaking bad back but the film was very slow and actually quite boring. It was a stretched out 2 hour episode that is telling a story that doesn't really need to be told. I wasn't disappointed at all, thought they all did a great job. Just left me wishing I had more to watch ðŸ˜­ Great end to a show. Aaron Paul was amazing. It feels as if Felina happened yesterday. Just nice all around. Jesse, a good bad guy you can't help feel sorry for. Was it needed? No. Was it enjoyable? Yes! Vince does a great job adding to the characters you've grown so fond of. True to the franchise (except for some cast showing significant aging given timeline- I'm looking at Todd) all in all I really enjoyed it. Aaron Paul does not disappoint. I expected more but is good. Nothing special, it is a good ending to Jesse's story and nice cameos but not a masterpiece. It's definatley good, worth the wait and splendidly crafted . Not all together a needed film, but what it gives it gives hard. We see Jessies own sense of bittersweet conclusion as he fights off the final lasting demons from Breaking Bad and goes of In his own light. It's delivered withe same sense of anxiety, tension, and fast smooth editing that Giligan masters, brought up to a cinematic stature. Aaron Paul is great as ever, delivering a performance that is heartbreaking with the characters and then fleashed out in nuace as he breaks bad in his own way. It all delivers well and is a damn good watch. A nice cap off to who may have been the only good in a cast of grey. This movie simply made me very satisfied. It had that Breaking Bad feel and everything was done smoothly. Pure satisfaction is what it is. As we say a classic stay's classic but if we just pull it off after a long break then it irritates & exactly that happened with this movie... The excitement it created slowly effuses out cause nothing much was shown in this movie , being a huge admirer of jessie pinkman yet he was unable to create that same magic which he created a decade ago & continued it for next five consecutive years. Sorry vince u spoiled it this time for me. I rewatched BB just before the movie. The movie in itself was great, but Todd fat I think this is what Jesse deserves, Aaron did justice to pinkman even after so many years. He nailed his performance and the humor in this movie reminds the good old Breaking Bad time. Even though people were satisfied with the show ending this movie did a justice to what happened with Jesse. Cinematography expectations met with show level, transition scenes are best. Don't get me wrong..
The acting was fantastic.. cinamatography top notch..
Story wise was expecting more.. Breaking Bad had more creativity in each episode than this movie..
Tod should have been CG'd to look 6 years younger, it was too distracting..
We still need to know if Mr. White is dead or not ..
Still open ended story..
Loved the movie though.. Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul have made a film that not only captures the essence of Breaking Bad but also reinvents itself to create a well worked film that the fans deserved. Bringing back characters through flashbacks was a great idea, the show would have been ruined if they brought Walt back to life so I thank them for not doing so, Vince and Aaron have well and truly protected the legacy of Breaking bad Was not good at all
I wish I was not watched this movie Well i was excpacting a lot. But this movie is just awfull. A really really bad movie If you throw out all of the unwarranted 10s that some people rated this movie, this movie would end up with around the 6 that it really deserves. Some things just feel forced and are back by popular demand, but should just be left alone ... and this is one of them. Sure, this did put a wrap on Jesse, and if that floats your boat, then fine, but a 10 is just crazy for this movie. This movie rocks. It's slow and it's plot-thin but it just WORKS. So good. I was one of a millions how was excited for this movie , then today it was a shock , an empty movie , a really bad story , maybe the best thing was Aroun Paul's acting , now i wish that this movie haven't published at all This is awful and I have absolutely nothing good to say about it. Firstly it has been way way way to long coming. It's absolutely pointless. Honestly leave it alone and pretend it hasn't been made. I am. Epic dialogue and very much lived up to the hype! I love anything with Aaron Paul, he very well deserved his Emmy wins. Maybe you can say I am a fanboy but I crave anything related to Breaking Bad; only reason I didn't watch sooner is cause I haven't been on Netflix since the middle of summer. The soundtrack and badassary is so great, I need to own the series I don't know why I haven't made an effort before. Why you hating on my review seriously this is excellent? Fine I won't go on Netflix again for awhile you guys are mean El Camino is excellent I'm begging you all appreciate my opinions!!!! Its the tipical netflix movie with no climax,worst than a average episode of breaking bad,whata. A lazy writers has netfix movies Did not disappoint!! I was cautiously optimistic... I mean... the series ended so well .... dont tempt fate Vince! But he did it.... it was perfect! Each scene of this excellent sequel is filmed with the framing and cinematography for which Braking Bad was known. Scenes were not rushed and the dialogue was crafted like a fine wine. Film making at its finest. This will probably be the last in this story line because of the scarcity of surviving characters. Those of us who love the Bad universe still have Saul and that is not inconsequential... A big fan of the series although the movie was a complete disappointment. No reason for making the movie with no plot.... Gilligan give us a break This is not so great, not so bad. It was nice to see the old characters. There were a few good moments like the shooting, and the end. But that's it. It's a pointless closure for us regarding Jessie. Watch it if you watched the series recently. Or maybe not. Your choice. Jesse was the weakest link in BB, the lovable idiot and the unwilling criminal. He certainly got his share of punishment and deserved some closure. I did not particularly care to know what happened to him after his dramatic liberation, but most of all I was dreading some overcooked final. Luckily, it was a relatively clever plot.<br/><br/>The movie was even more enjoyable for me because I watched it just after having been underwhelmed by season 5 of Better Call Saul. Compared to that mediocrity, this plot is sparkling and gripping.<br/><br/>The Jesse character is still a lovable loser, although much hardened by his experience and he goes about his business of collecting the money he needs with a lot less restraint than in the past.<br/><br/>My only negative remark is that all the characters look 10 years older (as they actually are) and it's impossible to believe that this story wraps up in the same time frame of BB I am a hard core fan of breaking bad. But I am not such a big fan boy that I am giving this movie more than 6/10, it is closer to 5 in my opinion.<br/><br/>It is promoted as a standalone movie, but it is nothing more than fan service. My wife who has not seen breaking bad did not understand most of what was going on, and neither of us found it particularly entertaining. Basically like watching two mediocre breaking bad episodes taken out of context. None of the tension and entertainment of the good ones.<br/><br/>Sure it is fun to see Skinny Pete and a bunch of the other characters again, but to be honest half of them just showed up for the sake of it. And doing the vacuum cleaner guy again? Seriously. This movie did not show me anything new.<br/><br/>Better call Saul is awesome, imo even better than Breaking Bad, so Vince and the others obviously still has it, but this movie did not bring anything new to the table, and felt quite unnecessary.<br/><br/>If you are a Breaking Bad fan you might enjoy spending some time with old friends, if not there are many better movies out there. It's slow, but that's what I expected. It has some great scenes. It's mostly a great fan service with returning characters, I am happy with it. This film follows on almost immediately from the events depicted in the final episode of Breaking Bad. Jesse is now free from captivity but the police are chasing him. He manages to get to friends Skinny Pete and Badger where he ditches Todd's El Camino. He has a plan to get out of town but that will require finding Todd's stash of cash; inevitably he isn't the only person looking for it. Intertwined with these scenes we see flashbacks of his time in captivity, including a strange 'day out' with Todd.<br/><br/>While I don't think this film was quite as good as 'Breaking Bad' it was pretty good. Fans were left wondering what would happen to Jesse after that series ended and this shows us in an interesting way. It provides some good moments of drama, from the opening car chase to dealings with others after Todd's money. The events have the feel of Breaking Bad and I liked how, thanks to flashbacks, several popular but deceased characters appear. Aaron Paul really impresses as Jesse; he was always important in the show but here he successfully carries the film. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see but I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the show left wanting more... if you haven't watched the show it is unlikely to appeal as it requires knowledge of what happened before. Breaking Bad, a synonym of the word LOVE. On their last episodes, they showed how Walt ended his way out.
El Camino showed how and where Jesse ended up. Won't give you spoiler. If you've completed Breaking Bad, then you're free to watch the movie and yes, El Camino worths watching I gave it as 6 as I loved Breaking Bad but this was really weak-Better Call Saul is far superior-maybe the 1.5 hour length just doesn't work for this stuff. We know what happened to jesse, but we lose some scene. Where the hell is skinny pete scene when he got arrested? From the trailer? And I expected more scene about what happened to walter white after that, is he burried or the investigation ongoing? All the stars just for continuing The Breaking Bad, they should make one more with White It's more like episode than a movie
And Jesse Plemons man you loss some wight before the movie and the triller had action more than the movie Of course nothing can top the Breaking Bad series and all its fireworks.<br/><br/>However they did a good job here for every that is a breaking bad fan, without ruining it at all.<br/><br/>Of course it's a bit pointless to watch this before breaking bad.<br/><br/>Otherwise enjoy it! The reason why El Camino seems slow to some fans is because BB was like a time bomb ticking,waiting to get exploded till the last scene of the last eoisode of S05 and yeah it did finally, shattering everyone's life connected to the main characters.. This was the nemesis.
But hey.. this is film isn't the continuation of thar explosion.. it's the Debris or you can say the ashes out of which a phoenix(Jesse) is born.. a ressurection so to speak...
This is got to be seemed slow paced to someone(though to me it didn't).. i was equally hooked to the last scene... One thing i would say it surpassed BB is the Editing.. it was sometimes incomprehensible which time are we at.. past or the present.. surely a beautiful cinematography should be credited for that. This movie was the perfect epilogue for the series. It shouldn't be seen as a stand alone movie. I really recommend watching the whole series again and ending the beautiful experience with this movie. Easter eggs and comebacks wont be dissapointing! It was trully satisfying to see the becoming of the most beloved character in the series. Such a nostalgic trip after so many years! Another great one for Vince Gillighan!! I can't help feeling underwhelmed by this effort. It feels like a tagging-onto the end of Breaking Bad & cannot be considered neccesary viewing for fans of the series. There were some glaring flaws; Todd (Jesse Plemons) is noticably bigger/ older to the point that I thought it was a different actor. So very early-on an another immersion-breaker added to Aaron Paul's advanced years & receding hair-line as Jesse (someone refers to him as TEEN!). Okay, okay, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief but by half-way through I just don't care. I'll hold on 'til the end. The End. Underwhelmed. If you're missing the Breaking Bad world & you haven't already, check out Better Call Saul. Seasons 1 & 2 have some filler but 3 & 4 get near to Breaking Bad quality; you can tell Gilligan & Odenkirk are in a flow-state (killing it). Despite the criticsm, I liked the movie. It is good to see what happened to Jesse.. Everybody is complaining about how slow was it or how it lacked action, but I don't think that the movie was boring.There were good messages abouut life and how life and people can change a lot.. Solid conception. To the point. I liked the extension to the story. Top work Netflix. Im a huge breaking bad fan. I've seen the series probably around five times. I consider it to be the best series that have ever been made.<br/><br/>However. This Movie basically gave me the answer that I had already made up in my head. This was how I pictured the ending. Not in as great detail as the movie of course, but still very similar. I don't really think I need that confirmation after five years.<br/><br/>Still a fan though. Aarun Paul*Jessi* is one of the greatest actors in our age. This movie is a living proof. I watched breaking bad because of him and im going to continue watching west world season 3 because he will be in it. I cant seem to find anyone who hates him or says that he cant act good or smth.
Now lets come to the movie: I really loved it and it couldn't be more better but i wish it was longer that 2 hours. What can i say? Im a huge breaking bad fan and yes i wish it continued so far with 1000 episodes i dont care.
PS: great start and a better ending. Do not expect stuff better then breaking bad.
Expect a good story that makes Pinkmans story good and finilized. Great story and great acting all way throug. Thats what i thought at first when i heard there will be a sequel movie for Breaking Bad series, i've never liked any kind of sequels. its so bad idea that could ruined the great ending for this masterpiece tv show
The final episode and the end were just too perfect and that's it!
There was saturation in terms of the end!<br/><br/>im glad that was separated movie so the tv show is in a safe side<br/><br/>Otherwise i haven't found the movie interesting and necessarily at all in mostly points, rather this, it would be better to make it out by ourselves ( fans ) how Jessie's journey possibly will be after he escaped in the last scene of the show. Farewell to Breaking Bad, and best ending Jesse Pinkman. Goodbye the best TV Series in the world . This is as good as a sequel gets. i missed the BrBa atmosphere so much, as i am sure many real fans did. i think the way jessie's story line was wrapped up was perfect. i was prompted to write this review by the whiny chitches that can't damn appreciate that we got another moment in this universe. i loved the ending too. it had a perfect melody and setting - without spoiling anything.
jessie's journey is complete, and his progress as a character is palpable. i even enjoyed one particular moment in a special shop where he realizes a past mistake. and the cameos were well done and nostalgic. it was engulfing beginning to end and the two hours flew by. The movie didn't really live up to its hype. Although it did answer some questions that breaking bad fans had about what happened after the final season.
I would still recommend giving this movie a watch and deciding for yourself how you feel about the movie.
I don't think that it is a bad movie overall just a little bit disappointed in what it could've been. This felt more of an episode of breaking bad rather than a movie.<br/><br/>***RIP Robert Forster*** It is a good follow up from the story but not much happens. They could of done a lot more with it in my opinion I watched Breaking Bad religiously through the seasons over and over at one point. It's my favorite series next to The Wonder Years. I was a little late in watching this because of life stuff but now that I had time to sit down and watch it, I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>El Camino follows right after the events of Breaking Bad which I think is a mistake. Everyone aged by this point and I know it's obvious with Better Call Saul but it's more obvious here. When Jesse was screaming in his car at the end, his beard wasn't that long. Todd had noticeable gained weight and even Skinny Pete and Badger don't look the same anymore. I think this movie would have been even better if it picked up some years later and maybe have Jesse struggling with a new life instead. Also the flashbacks felt unneeded other than to deliver fan service.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed it but some aspects was a little distracting. One flashback had Jesse with a gun in front of Todd and it just seemed out of character that he didn't just shoot him. I get why because of continuity but why have the scene in the first place?<br/><br/>But hey, every Breaking Bad fan should check it out. I'm happy they made it. Like several have previously stated, I didn't quite know what to expect from this film. Was it bad? No, but it depends on your definition of 'bad'. It was well written, directed, acted, and paced. But it definitely was not an extension of "Breaking Bad". It was basically an epilogue for Jesse Pinkman, a messed up young man who got into something over his head and nearly paid with his life. I suppose you could term it a kind of redemption story. He realizes, almost too late, just how badly he screwed up, comes to terms with it, and wants nothing more than a chance to completely break free and start over. Does the film succeed? I think so and quite well.
Along with Aaron Paul, the real gem of the show is the late Robert Forester's role. Quiet, reserved, and powerful. The man had chops. It was also nice to see a snippet of my all-time favorite BB character, Mike. I sincerely hope he shows up in the up-coming season of "Better Call Saul". The movie was ok but very boring and not something special, just a lot of flashbacks combined in a movie. Great for the BB fan but you don't miss anything. This was the Aaron Paul show. It seems almost entirely made to showcase him... and thats not a bad thing. I like Aaron Paul. I feel like I watched him evolve as an actor while Breaking Bad was in it's run. As though he were learning the craft from Cranston and really helped along by incredible writing. For God Sake he made Need for Speed a watchable movie. He's a solid actor... one of the very few American actors with real ability.<br/><br/>As most will or have stated - this movie was completely unnecessary. It didn't add anything whatsoever to the legacy of BB -- however unlike S8 of Game of Thrones it didn't destroy it's own legacy in a single stroke either. El Camino was simply... fine *shrugs shoulders*.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan has been desperate for a reason to revisit his masterpiece as though he were incapable of creating something else... maybe he is... who knows. I was worried when I heard about this... I thought "why can't people ever realize when they've won?!?" Breaking Bad was a winner. The ending was wonderful. Not knowing what happened to Jessy was amazing. Leave it alone!<br/><br/>But thats not the way Hollywood does things. Hollywood is all about squeezing until it's devoid of all life. Better Call Saul is another unnecessary dud. The world of BB is nothing without Walter White. He's dead. It's over. You accomplished something very very few people in your profession ever do. You won. Paul, Gilligan and everyone involved... you're all wildly talented. Move on. That's how you need to look at this film, it's an epilogue to "Breaking Bad." Though not needed this film is a wonderful final journey for the character of Jesse Pinkman (and Aaron Paul at his best) as well as a good moment of closure for fans as well as Vince Gilligan. If looked at on its own you'll find a nice crime thriller with great undertones of drama, and that's all you really need from this story. This movie takes off from the finale episode of BB. But this feels like a 2-hour finale episode of BB where they give Jesse Pinkman a happy ending. Giving BB fans some sort of closure. It's a solid, quality work from Vince Gilligan. I agree, Aaron Paul and Jesse Plemmons could've lost a few pounds to maintain some sort of continuity from the last episode, but this isn't Joker, they are not Joaquin Phoenix. Overall, if you're a BB fan, you'll be happy with this, especially seeing some of the show's characters again. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, don't bother with this movie (instead watch BB!), as it's very reliant on past characters and events to make much sense. For a BB fan it is alright, but it pretty much feels like an extended epilogue episode of the show. Temper your expectations and you won't be disappointed. Let me begin by saying I am a big BB fan, I have watched it 3 times already, but won't bother watching this movie again. It should have been half an hour less. Less of Todd, less flashbacks. The shootout was comical. I'm pretty sure everyone knew Jesse would shoot from his second gun. Plus people are saying it completes Jesse's arc. No it doesn't. Jesse is still going to be scared every time he goes public, just like Saul. I didn't hesitate to go to theater to see El Camino the first day it was released. I was expecting something phenomenal and mind blowing since I am a big fan of breaking bad series, but I found it was a slow continuation of the series, and actually there's no story in the film. Aaron Paul performance is average in the film and nothing special, I am giving a rating of 6 just because its related to breaking bad. As most people who are watching El Camino, I am a huge fan of Breaking Bad, and think it's probably the best show ever made; however, I didn't let that influence my judgment of the movie. I know how to separate my love for the show and the characters from how I feel about this movie. And this movie was good, but nothing special.<br/><br/>Of course it was fun seeing Skinny Pete, Badger, and a handful of other characters who had appeared in the show, and luckily no one's inclusion felt forced. Jesse would of course visit his friends first, he'd need Joe to remove the car, he spent a lot of time with Todd, etc. And they didn't just throw in Skylar/Marie/Walt Jr., which was nice since we would only have needed to see them if this film was about Walter.<br/><br/>The flashbacks were tasteful: not overbearing, but enough to give direction to Jesse's continued story line. Above all, they made sense. Gilligan didn't have to scramble for there to be conflict for Jesse: it all came naturally. Of course there would be cops looking for him, and it is logical that he'd look for Todd's money to use as an escape, since Jesse spent time with him.<br/><br/>When we got to the man who could make Jesse disappear, it was also nice that he retained his word and character, and didn't just willy-nilly accept Jesse as a patron without repercussions for that first pickup. One of the most interesting characters from the show that continued into this movie.<br/><br/>I was waiting for and expecting the ending to throw some curveball, as the show often did, though that didn't really happen. That's not to say that the concluding battle wasn't pretty cool. The duel was a fitting way to end a franchise located in the desert, and while I enjoyed how Jesse beat Neil, I think it was predictable that he had the second gun in his jacket, since we'd just seen it.<br/><br/>Jesse's personality as a whole was well preserved in this movie, as he really didn't want to kill the "cops" and those same guys later at the welding warehouse. He shot only when he had no other options, and he let the last guys go free because he's not a killer at heart.<br/><br/>In classic Gilligan style, there were a few moments of detail that most people wouldn't even think to include in the movie, such as when Jesse's jacket catches on fire. The heat from the pocket gun he had just shot would be hot enough (I'm assuming) to start a fire on fabric, so it was a cool moment.<br/><br/>And of course there were some fan-service easter eggs, from the blatant tarantula to the obscure pull-away floor panel in Jesse's house that resembled the one Walt created to hide his cash in the White house. These hides were not intrusive and were scattered infrequently, which I appreciated. I enjoy catching those allusions, but I don't want every shot or piece of dialogue to be referring back to the show.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, my and most people's main concern was that they would ruin things from the show. Characters, events, or other, it's always a worry that an afterthought to a great show will be messy and forget how to fit into a specially curated show. El Camino does a great job at upholding the integrity of the show.<br/><br/>Thank god Walt didn't come back to life or anything (though I felt Gilligan would know better than do something like that). And having just a single flashback with Walt was perfect, though the scene didn't seem particularly needed. They talked about college, but since Jesse ends in seclusion in Alaska, it's not like he's planning on applying to University (I'm assuming).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think Gilligan was too focused on upholding the show's integrity that he forgot to make a truly remarkable masterpiece like the show was. The movie was by no means bad, but I could frankly take it or leave it.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a good movie with some good character and dialogue, but ultimately, it isn't necessary. I'm not mad that it was made, but I feel basically the same about the ending of this movie as I did the end of the show: Jesse's free. And if I feel the same, then the movie doesn't feel mandatory.<br/><br/>I will continue to recommend people watch Breaking Bad, since it's amazing, but when they ask if they should watch El Camino, I won't push one way or the other. This movie is kinda lame. I really loved to get a little bit more of that passionate "Breaking Bad vibe" but that's all i really enjoyed about "El Camino".<br/><br/>When you watch the trailer and see Skinny Pete being interrogated by the cops, you create some expectations, like seeing Jesse trying to scape and getting involved in a lot of complicated situations or whatever, something really breathtaking, but it never happens. This movie looks like more as a "Jesse's run around". We were even forced to watch some completely useless and weird kind of friendship between Jesse and Todd.<br/><br/>Also, this movie doesn't even look like to have some kind of development, it just end sudenlly.<br/><br/>As i already said, El Camino is good for those who wants to have a little bit more of "Breaking Bad vibe" but, despite of that, it's a pretty sad waste of potential. Not necessarily a bad thing, but this felt like an extension of the final episode. It still deserves and high rating because six years later it continued to surprise, have good dialogue, and unique shots that virtually every show today lacks. I think making this movie was too risky considering they could have completely butchered Jesse's ending. In the end, Vince Gilligan delivers and it was nice to revisit Albuquerque again. A beautiful movie recalled some memories of Brecking Bad and touched the beautiful director and writer During the breaking bad series, I really grew to care about Jesse and felt sad for him and the way he was treated by everybody. At the end of the show when he got away in the el camino car I was crying with joy that my favourite character got away alive. I mentally thanked Hysenberg (?) for looking out for him underneath his bullying towards him.
When this movie came out I was so happy to watch Jesse continue to try and escape his past by changing his identity. Aaron Paul plays an awesome Jesse Pinkman and my heart still goes out for the fictional character. I am so glad he finds his way out of it all and gets to start over again. First off, if you're a Breaking Bad fan how can you not like this movie? This was a great prologue type movie that was made to be a closing in finality of the Breaking Bad arc. Aaron Paul did a tremendous job showing Jesse's fear but dedication to getting out of his predicament. That said, this was pretty much a 2 hour episode of Breaking Bad, but that's not a bad thing. I did find myself having to recall some moments and characters, even being a Breaking Bad fan, so I explore you all to maybe rewatch the 5th season cliff notes to figure out what exactly all happened, other than the obvious moments we will never forget. I didn't, so I myself was lost at times, and this movie would probably be better if I knew exactly what happened.<br/><br/>I appreciate more closure with Jesse's character. Breaking Bad was perfect and I really didn't have any quarrels with how it left Jesse's story "unfinished," but now I see why the movie was made.<br/><br/>The movie had all that worked in Breaking Bad, the suspense, the humor, the pacing, the overall feel. It felt good to be back in the ABQ, well done Vince and all for making a great send off movie for one of the greatest shows ever made. When I rewatch the series I will probably rewatch this, and my rating might be higher, but for now an 8 it is. Never has a series been so perfectly-crafted as 'Breaking Bad.' It had the perfect beginning, character growth through the middle and dramatic conclusion which wrapped everything up neatly. So why did we need a 'sequel?' Well, we probably don't, but, seeing as it stars all of the original cast (yes, I know some are dead - welcome to the world of flashbacks) and was made by the same writing team, why not revisit Albuquerque for one last time?<br/><br/>I guess out of all the characters in 'Breaking Bad' Aaron Paul's 'Jessie Pinkman' was possibly the one who's fate was the most unclear. 'El Camino' shows us what happened directly after the events in the TV show. As you probably have guessed, I loved 'Breaking Bad.' It's definitely one of my favourite TV programmes of all time. And 'El Camino' honours and expends on everything well.<br/><br/>I could leave it there, but I do wonder what someone would think of it who has never seen the TV show before. Would they actually 'get' everything? Probably, in story terms. As you might expect if you watched the TV show's final episode Jesse goes on the run and this film charts what he does next. There's nothing too 'out there' here. However, if you aren't 'up' on the previous five series, you probably wouldn't get half as much out of the film.<br/><br/>It's just over two hours long and, in my opinion, probably could have done with (at least) being a six part mini series. There's a lot here and it does feel a bit rushed sometimes. Don't get me wrong - I loved 'El Camino,' but possibly its only downside is that I would have preferred to see even more of everything that goes on.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, there's plenty of well known cast members returning due to flashbacks and even more 'fan service.' There was one scene (set in the past) that I felt went on a little too long and probably could have been trimmed for a bit more action than happens in the present, but that's a minor gripe. Aaron Paul proves that he can headline a movie on his own (even if some of his Box Office outings may say otherwise!) and if you enjoyed the TV show you should appreciate this, too. When Breaking Bad ended in 2013, we were left to wonder what happened to Jesse Pinkman. The last time we saw him, he was escaping the chaotic conclusion of series finale as flashing police lights appeared in the rear view mirror of his stolen El Camino. Did he successfully flee from his tragic life of crime? This epilogue chapter answers that definitively. But was it really necessary?<br/><br/>There's plenty of fun for fans of the series to enjoy here. Fun that stays true to its great predecessor. Returning characters, clever call backs to classic episodes, poignant flash back scenes, and that hardwired sense of tension that made Breaking Bad so memorable. There was one scene in particular that felt especially nostalgic in this regard.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's dive back into his iconic character was natural, and the photography of New Mexico combined with Dave Porter's score produced authentic Breaking Bad vibes. But shockingly, the writing and story direction did feel a bit off. Certainly not on the opus level quality from Vince Gilligan's best work on the franchise. Despite a massive manhunt and some questionable decisions from Pinkman, the law never feels present.<br/><br/>But again, this epilogue to Breaking Bad is entirely enjoyable. I'm glad it exists but I just think I prefer Jesse Pinkman's nebulous fate in the series finale to the literal one we see here. Unnecessary follow up to the show. Felt more like a tribute than a story than can stand its own. The pace was also stretched and overly slow. A few inconsistencies damage the plot, and it's not credible. The movie was not bad at all, in fact it was even good but it was just not the same Breaking Bad feeling without Walter White. I thought they could at least have him in a coma and then later die in prison or just have him in more flashbacks. This movie was a movie purely about Jesse Pinkman and if you weren't a big fan of Jesse, you surely will be dissapointed like me The movie is just good and is really felt like watching the series 6 years back yet I've only one major comment about Tod, what he did to the housekeeper lady doesn't match his character as it was built up in the series to be a villain only when he has to be, he was this type who respected Walter White and liked Lydia so he was the type of a character who was normal in the inside yet withdrawn with the bad career of his family not a butcher to kill an old lady for this stupid reason
I think this is poor writing from Vince Gilligan as he should've introduced the same original Tod character Have some things in the movie that bother me, but, in geral, he is magnific, i loved it I loved the movie and the way Gilligan directs, recalls various Breaking Bad little bits and pieces, it was lovely to see some of the characters again, if you are already a fan you will like it. The reason why I gave this movie 8/10 is because the beginning is a bit slow. But the more and more the movie comes further into the story. The better it gets. As a massive BB fan i was expecting a bit more from El Camino but it was just ok .... still saying that it was the ending i wanted for jesse but it was a bit slow ....!!!!! El Camino is essentially an extra 2-3 episodes of Breaking Bad, showing us what happened to Jesse Pinkman after the show ended. Picking up right after the finale, we see Jesse on the run from the law as he evades the police, and the gang after his escape from hostility. A few familiar characters return, which I won't get into, but any Breaking Bad fan will be satisfied and happy with this conclusion.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul once again owns Jesse Pinkman. He owns this role and has created one of the most memorable and lovable characters on TV, and here is no different. Every character serves their purpose to Jesse in this film, whether that means good or bad.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan did state that he would not have made this film if the story wasn't there, but he believed in this story, and while it is slow paced, it does bring closure to Jesse and the series as a whole. It is definitely worth a watch for any Breaking Bad fan who wishes to see what has happened after the show ended. It seemed more like a tribute and farewell to the original series than an actual movie. Man, it was an experience, yo! El Camino follows Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul's) after he escapes from his captives. This movie should be treated as its own, not just an extension to the beloved Breaking Bad. Gilligan's story is tied up neatly like a bow, and will definitely satisfy the hardcore BrBa fans. It might be an exceptionally great TV movie for continuing a standalone series, which has been hailed as one of the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>With the cinematography and the brilliant soundtrack, the tension seems to be elevated, sprinkled with a terrific performance by Aaron Paul, as we experience Jesse going through all the hardships, which might be hard to look at. Although it might not satisfy some fans. Why, because it has no blue meth, no Walter White (just a small flashback), no Hank Schrader, no DEA, rather a slow-paced, humane study of Jesse suffering from PTSD, who tries to break free from the shackles of his guilt, while the police are behind him. But, if you are a true Breaking Bad fan , then you don't even need Blue Meth to make the show interesting!<br/><br/>In the end, if you have watched Breaking Bad and are a hardcore meth-head like me, you're surely going to feel good about it! Have some patience, take a deep breath, and have some tissue papers around you, and then sit back and watch the movie. Peace! ;) El Camino: A Breaking Bad movie is an unequivocally satisfying swan song of Breaking Bad's robust run that grips the very attention of audiences especially it's ardent fans. Being one of the powerful Netflix original gestures, El Camino delivers a powerful ode to Breaking Bad franchise that chimes in the cinematic universe. It boasts of dark and gritty performances especially by Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman. Creator, writer, and director Vince Gilligan's ambition for the project attunes to the fullest extent and doesn't lack any conviction or commitment. The movie is an adequate and a gratifying way of dropping the curtains on some of the memorable Breaking Bad characters that make a boisterous appearance when you expect them the least to do so. The cinematography is fine sands that dissects the scenes in a mythical way. I enjoyed a follow up of the aftermath of Breaking Bad as it was good to see a full ending for Jesse. I kinda wish they would have given a touch up on Walter's family but that's not really that important I guess. Also, what was going on with Todd? Could he have not lost weight for his role as past Todd? There's this scene where Jesse is in the cage and you can see Todd's gut sticking out. I couldn't even see his face because of the obvious weight gain. It felt like he somehow survived though he died in the last season of Breaking Bad. Regardless, it's was a great ending to Jesse Pinkman. I went into this movie with exceedingly high hopes. Indeed, Breaking Bad is my favourite show of all time, and this movie had a lot to live up to. However, the movie itself is slow-paced and departs from its partner series in that it lacks the authentic action and storytelling we fans have come to expect.<br/><br/>However, it is not all bad. Aaron Paul delivers an outstanding performance as Jesse Pinkman. For a man that had never acted before Breaking Bad, he has startlingly beautiful deliverance throughout the entire movie, and is probably the saving grace of the entire thing. He fully deserves the accolades coming his way.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, but the writing seemed a little forced in places. This is not to discredit Vince, of course. He's a fabulous writer and my opinion of his writing for this movie does not negate the utter grandiosity of his writing for the series. It's not that the writing is bad, it is just not up to his usual standards.<br/><br/>Ultimately, could I have done without this movie? Yes. Do I find closure in knowing what happened to Jesse? Yes. This sequel is really well made. After all, Vince Gilligan is a great screenwriter. The flashbacks (analepsis) are well linked in the story with the series. And give it up to Aeron Paul who, I don't know why, has got a great performance and chemistry only in this series. But, here is my critique: Jesse Pinkman's face is all over the news and I'll bet there's TV broadcast in Alaska. So, why the heck didn't Jesse get a disguise in the end just like Saul Goodman did. It didn't make sense to me at all that he and his "Vacuum cleaner" guy thought it all through to get away and in the end Jesse flees with a clean face. The story of pinkman was way too short in my opinion. What is he gonna do in Alaska? Also what happend to Walt his family? Could've been so much more than this. "El Camino" is a 2019 drama directed by Vince Gilligan starring Aaron Paul. It's undeniable that "Breaking Bad" is one the greatest TV shows of all time and as I watched it for the first time in the first half of this year, I immediately fell in love with it. The characters, the excellent writing and the development from season to season: Everything was near perfect. As everyone else probably, I was tremendously sad after the final episode and wondered what would come after the final credits rolled. A question diehard fans had to wait six years for until it got answered. Now the most anticipated sequel of the year finally arrived - and it was really worth the wait! The story begins immediately after the final scene of BB - and you could assume after a few minutes in what direction the rest of the film would go. Overall, it all feels like an extended episode of the TV show and that is everything but terrible. In the same brilliant manner, the film slowly depicts the aftermath of the disaster. With several well done switches between flashback and the present day it delivers a highly packing crime drama, at times it even felt like a neo western, to be honest. It literally breathed the same chemically polluted air as the original show and you can literally see that the priority of this film is the fan service, as it hides multiple easter eggs and cameos that will bring you indescribable joy. The story itself is the best outcome possible, it's dark, depressing and packing, as always excellently acted by everyone involved. Every question that still haunted you will be answered in the process and entertains you all the same. Of course you can see how much the actors have aged over the past six years, but it still knows to keep up the illusion that it takes place only a little later. All in all, this film is the best conclusion the legendary show could get, it appeases both the fans and the critics and treats the legacy with much respect, but still manages to keep the beloved originality. As a fan I can assure: This film is everything you ever wanted and a worthy and emotional farewell to one of the most outstanding shows of all time. Thank you, Mr. Paul and Mr. Gilligan for doing this for us! I'll start by acknowledging that people were disappointed about the flashbacks, and how the actors looked different - yeah, it's been six years, let that go.<br/><br/>The film itself was great with cinematography and score. The greatest flaw the film has was its audience; BB fans had too high hopes.
Simply put, this was Jesse's Felina, and it's great and shouldn't have ended differently, or gone a different way. We could have filled in the gaps after BB ended, but that's unfair to Jesse who was just as pivotal as Walter White, who had an amazing end.<br/><br/>The film needed to find a reason for Jesse to know about the money, and I understand the writing there - but Jesse wouldn't have given the gun back to Todd had this been an episode of BB - he would have killed him, and tried to save Brock. The plot has to plot though, so had Vince Gilligan cut the gun part but kept the rest, it would have been fine.<br/><br/>Simply put. The Wild West showdown was lame. Didn't make sense. Had Jesse gone in guns a-blazing, that would have fit his character more so than agreeing to something like this.<br/><br/>Everyone thinks it was for the "fanboys" that Walter White was written in - but admit it, had Gilligan not written him in, people would bash that as well. That was truly an amazing part, and it was fun to see Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston's chemistry together again.<br/><br/>Great film - would have been amazing if the two gun parts were cut or written differently. I think everyone likely expected a story line a bit different than what we got. Regardless, we were given some classic Jesse moments (96%) that either made you laugh or made you feel bad for Jesse as if you were watching Breaking Bad episodes all over again. These actors falling right back into their characters, as if several years hasn't gone by, is amazing. The movie is a perfect epilogue to the Breaking Bad TV series. It isn't perfect and it drags at times but so did the show in the middle seasons. Go watch it. You won't be disappointed. It was a good Netflix film, but I thought it would have more excitement. Maybe some comic relief like Breaking Bad. The movie is getting Jesse from point A to point B. It's not so much a continuation of Breaking bad which is what people are comparing it to but a continuation of Jesses character arc. I thought it went well and for what they wanted to do with the story I think it worked well My first review... I don't like to write so much.<br/><br/>The film is good... BrBa's universe it's for me a masterpiece. Vince did a great job, and we keep watching this in Better Call Saul.<br/><br/>However, Better Call Saul brings more for the universe and story than this film. For me, this film is almost a 'fan service'. The 8 is just because the memories. Breaking Bad - one of the most incredible TV shows to grace our screens. Vince Gilligan concluded Walter White's criminal story in a satisfying and fair way but we can all agree that we were all left with the same question upon its end - what happened to Jesse Pinkman? El Camino answers this question.<br/><br/>I will mention now that this feature is not a standalone masterpiece. Although it is a great film, a lot of what makes it great is nostalgia. Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece, so I never expected anything that would surpass this. But don't let that statement smolder your hype for what is, in every way, just another Breaking Bad episode; extended to a generous two hours.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul once again provides an extraordinary credit to Jesse Pinkman, this time very focused on the characters anxiety post capture by Todd's Neo-Nazi uncle. Jesse's first experience back into civilised life, still conveying flashbacks of captivity, builds Paul a pedestal in which he confidently displays his incredible acting passion.<br/><br/>The movie stays true to the show's signature cinematography. From the vibrant use of light and shadows, to the evocative fixed camera angles. The film keeps you immersed, in the same way it did binge-watching the original.<br/><br/>Without Breaking Bad, this film is not revolutionary. But for anyone who loved the show, this film is essential. It captures Jesse's troubles and releases them in witty and heart-warming display of raw artistic bliss. El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is to Jesse Pinkman, what Felina was to Walter White. A solid conclusion worthy of its title. The bitter-sweet ending we all hoped and anticipated? I'll let you be the judge of that. To me this episode was a nice simple ending to one of the greatest character journeys ever written. There was nothing tremendous about this conclusion, however maybe we didn't necessarily need it. Jesse Pinkman deserved to have a fresh start and quite frankly have something go right for once. Breaking Bad will always hold a special place in all fans hearts and now we can all sleep night knowing Jesse has a brand new opportunity for a fresh beginning. Bravo Vince. This movie brought back a lot of mixed memories from the series. My favorite was the wild west scene! So, this movie goes around and expands a little plot: Jesse needs some cash so he can make a new life. It's all about of how he gets to these events. You feel Jesse's pain, you worry about his safety like that child you want to protect. You want to help him, tell him what to do, but you can't and still, Jesse, this man who was a little irresponsible kid, now grew to be a real man and in a way listens to your good advice. And you saw his evolution, you saw his suffering and what took him to get there and how he fought his way. I just feel like he now accepts the fact money isn't everything, he knows that if he could take all of it back, living with nothing, he would do it again. The appreciation of life and freedom. This is not just a commercial way to keep Breaking Bad going(i mean, they made money of course), but it's a real closure, now i feel i needed it and this is my ending.<br/><br/>This movie is great guys, i don't know if you can rate it high if you didn't watch Breaking Bad, but i mean, it's a sequel, what do you expect? Also, i read someone complaining about fan boys that randomly rate this movie 10/10, while they actually are the only ones to make a real review. To those arrogants, don't question please anybody's opinion. I only have one problem with this movie: it could have been a way better movie if it would not trying to be like BB so much. I think the reason that me and some other people think that BCS is better than this movie is not because BCS has way more time, but because BCS is not a copy of BB but has another Concept not like El Camino thats Just trying to be BB. When I first heard they were making a 'Breaking Bad Movie' I didn't know what to think. Although I do stand by my initial thoughts that this isn't 100% needed, this is a great send off for Jesse Pinkman and the Breaking Bad franchise. A must watch for any fan of the original series. If you enjoyed breaking bad, it rounds off Jesse's arc even better than the finale did, as well as adding extra depth to supporting cast like Todd. Only misses a 10 because it doesn't work as well on its own, and only really works as an epilogue (may i repeat a perfect one however) to the breaking bad universe. It would work great as an extended episode.
Very similar to Bandersnatch for Black Mirror in that way.
But since it's a solo movie, I expected a little bit more of depth and development.
This is coming from a huge Breaking Bad fan, so the rating sums up my "expectation vs. reality" situation.
The cinematography and soundtrack blew me away, nonetheless. I still got a feeling this is not the end for Breaking Bad "universe". I joined Netflix so I could watch this, lucky for me that I have a free month first. It's a solid 7 but nothing special. It was interesting to see that over 100 IMDB users had given it 10/10 before it was even released, however the rating is coming down now that people that have actually seen it are now rating and reviewing.
Jesse is Jesse, weak at times, ruthless and brave in others. A not very clever or original plot, along with an obligatory shoot out and fireball explosion are what you'll be served in a well shot way, at least there isn't a car chase, that level of barrel scraping wasn't needed. Okay, mostly enjoyable, but far from unmissable. The best thing of this film is that it is not like breaking bad or better call saul, it s completely different and that is very cool. Other thing is that it isn t a film with a lot of action and sh*** like some spinofes, it just shows what happened to jesse in a very pacific and good way This movie was a great way to wrap up an entire series. It was true to breaking bad form and I feel I can put the series to rest knowing where Jesse ended up. Will I always want more? Yes. But I can live with this ending. Did it need to be made? No.
Am I glad it was? Absolutely!
Did it ruin BrBa in anyway? Not at all. Was it done well? Definitely!<br/><br/>We could have very well left off with BrBa's series finale BUT it's cool after 5+ yrs to get the definitive fate of Jesse Pinkman as the creator would see fit being there were definitely questions left open when Jesse drove off in that finale such as: Where does he go from here & how? How has all of this changed him? Does he run or does he face what he's been a part of head on? Is there any shot at a normal life now? And that's exactly what this feature sets out to explore given the nuclear fallout of the lifestyle and past decisions these characters had made.<br/><br/>There are plenty of callbacks to BrBa both post mortem and through a series of flashbacks of Jesse in captivity as well as never before seen more nostalgic moments shared between him & some of our favorite past key players. I give it a solid 8/10 and thought it served as a good closing chapter on another one of the main character's journies ultimately answering the question of whether any of these people could have anything remotely close to a happy ending, and I'll just leave it at that... ❤it's so amazing.best..and the ending was so sad😥❤ I agree most of the reviews. It is not 10/10 movie, but very nice story for Jesse. I think this is very realistic picture of what Jesse would have done etc. It would never be believable if Jesse goes full on Walter White.<br/><br/>I am happy for the ending and hope that someway we will hear about Jesse in future episodes of Better call Saul :D It would be awesome to know how he´s doing. He has created a masterpiece of cinema history.
This is quiet disappointing for me maybe I'm to much of a fan or I didn't find that creativity that he had put on the show. Watched this after watching Breaking Bad (for the third time). Great followup. The story starts a bit slow with lots of flashbacks but really ramps up and kept me wondering what's coming next! This is as good a followup to Breaking Bad I could expect in two hours, and I felt it did the show, and Jesse, justice. I'm not sure why there are so many mediocre reviews, they led me to be skeptical, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. Was this film necessary, probably not. Was I worried that it would detract from arguably the greatest series ever made, absolutely! However El Camino did a good job at giving one of our favourite characters a fitting farewell. I have read a lot of reviews saying that this movie is to Jesse, what Felina was to Walt. I would agree although Felina was absolutely exceptional TV, El Camino plays out like two good episodes of BB.<br/><br/>The movie is very tense, slow at times, but always enjoyable and does a good job in adding to the BB catalogue (as does the brilliant Better Call Saul). There are some wonderfully unique camera angles, and many other classic nods to BB, not least some of the cameo appearances. I also love the ending, to me it was perfect Jesse Pinkman. I know there was so much hype around this film and I'm sure some people were expecting something absolutely mind-blowing, but I thought the film did a really good job at not letting anyone down. Realistically I think most people would have taken that! I really can't say this is a good "movie". It is mostly an extended Breaking Bad epilogue episode. If you're a Breaking Bad fan and keep that in mind, then you will have a fantastic time; I sure did! Definitely a nice wrap up with familiar tone, style and characters while waiting for the final season of Better Call Saul. The movie is the perfect continuation to BB. All characters are incorporated just perfectly and the Walt scenesl is icing on the cake. Brilliant!!! El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie finally ends Jesse's story by explaining what happened after he escaped his imprisonment. At first El Camino didn't feel necessary, but it brings such a satisfying ending to Jesse Pinkman. There's a lot to like about El Camino for the Breaking Bad fans, it doesn't feel tacked on just for a cash grab, it feels like a homage for Jesse Pinkman.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad was the best candidate for directing El Camino, because El Camino feels exactly like a longer version of a Breaking Bad episode. It has these extremely intense scenes that are similar to the ones in Breaking Bad. The dialogue for all the characters is unchanged, so El Camino doesn't feel like such a jarring change between the show and the movie. The screenplay was done well, but at times it feels like the story is heading in a direction that isn't clear. During the third act, you become completely aware of where the movie is taking you, and that's when the story gets most intense.<br/><br/>The acting in El Camino is by far the best part about the film. All of the performances by the actors made it feel like there wasn't a six year gap between Breaking Bad and El Camino. Aaron Paul really immerses you into the character of Jesse Pinkman. Aaron Paul not even getting a nomination for his performance amazes me, and in my opinion, he gave the best performance of the year. Jesse Plemons was also great in El Camino for playing a creepy sociopath, and the duo with Aaron Paul makes El Camino feel real; I'm glad that he at least got a nomination.<br/><br/>Since Vince Gilligan is the director and Marshall Adams is the cinematographer, El Camino is shot excellently, like the show. There's so many wide shots that makes the scenery and setting so pleasing to watch. The dull setting and color palette made Breaking Bad have such a depressing atmosphere, and in El Camino, it's exactly the same.<br/><br/>El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is literally a long Breaking Bad episode. It's exactly the same, so if you're a Breaking Bad fan, El Camino is a must watch. It has the cinematography, the atmosphere, and the acting; don't wait another minute and go watch El Camino. The fate of Jessie is revealed in a two hour film that was made many years after the BB finale. It's almost like the final two episodes of Breaking Bad S5. The first thirty minutes of this film are slow - but the final hour and half are really intense. A lot of nods to the original series and a few tearjerker moments in the finale - including two scenes I really liked. Overall, this was a very solid way to think of the end to Breaking Bad. Maybe one of the best endings to a series ever - in some respects. It was a good ending.but i think they should extend the movie 10-15 min longer.there,they should include the clip of skinny pete interrogation about jesse. I just done watching all the seasons of breaking bad just after the day yesterday. It's all great in this movie, it all has to be, not more and not less than this. It's just for the next steps of Jesse. Movie has very clear and obvious story and which totally satisfied. There is no way for me to analyze this film on its on merit; I love Breaking Bad. The actors are all displayed as they currently are not as they were when Breaking Bad was new (they noticeably look different). The story brings back a lot of show memories, and I was smiling while watching a lot of scenes. When I knew the movie was coming to a close, "memento mori" came to my head. The ending was not a huge addition to the end of the show, yet a sense of closer was given. A good watch with enough fan service to get Breaking Bad fans excited. Add a star if a big Breaking Bad fan. The story is focused on what happens to Jesse Pinkman while being captured and the attempt to find his way out. Aaron Paul continues his great acting in this role and the story moves along kind of slowly to fill the entire length of the movie. I ended the film thinking that not much happened which is why I could see a non Breaking Bad fan not appreciating the movie and would reduce a star in that case. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, don't watch this movie, it's too much of an ode to the show to get the full experience if you haven't seen it. I think that's possibly the weakness of this movie is that the two are so intertwined and the film doesn't stand alone. However I thought it was a great finish to the story, had there not been a follow up film I would've been just as satisfied but if you loved Breaking Bad, it's hard to say no to more. This film is classic Gilligan, with all the beautiful pastel colors and intense moments that the show had. I urge you to see it. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad that's okay! Just watch the entirety of the show before you see this film. Consider yourself prescribed! Directed by Vince Gilligan. Starring Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons, Robert Forster, Scott MacArthur, Scott Shepherd, Charles Baker, Matt Jones, Tom Bower, Tess Harper, Michael Bofshever. (TV-MA)<br/><br/>Movie epilogue to the television series "Breaking Bad" traces the immediate aftermath of Jesse Pinkman (Paul) speeding away from the Aryan Brotherhood compound in an El Camino. Written, directed and co-produced by series creator Vince Gilligan, the gritty authenticity, neo-noir suspense, volatile cocktail of percolating violence, startling coincidences, and penchant for elliptical interludes are all intact here. Storyline is a fairly simple one--Jesse needs to evade authorities and get himself a lot of money so he can disappear off the grid forever; this relentless drive is interrupted frequently by flashbacks that do little besides revisit and expand upon past incidents, restate what faithful viewers already knew, and add some streamlined perspective to the lessons Jesse has had to grudgingly learn along the way. Leans a little too much on the cameos of deceased characters, which provide more fan service than dramatic juice, but the movie still delivers enough galvanized stimulation and character arc closure to rate as a potent but inessential coda. Not recommended for anyone who hasn't watched most if not every episode of the show (the last season at the very least).<br/><br/>74/100 I "accidentally" caught a Breaking Bad marathon on AMC one day and my life changed. A show I had no interest in before (I have little interest in TV as a whole) became a literal obsession of mine. Truly it is one of finest, if not the finest television series to ever air. Literal essays have been written about the character arc if Walter White, the desolate fate of Jesse Pinkman, the Stockholm syndrome of Skyler, etc. No essay can be written about El Camino. And let me just say: this didn't have to be the case. With a foundation a rich as BB, essentially a modern day Western, a story of domestic disillusion, with better financing and writing, we could have had a phenomenal film. Vince Gilligan might be the type of guy to stretch things out. I think he should have collaborated and then we could have something like this: Jesse needs to escape, some old villains come looking for him (because the new ones are ridiculously out of place), perhaps some of Jack's men that have a good stash of money. Jesse agrees to do another meth cook and nostalgia comes flooding back. Although most of BB is a character stud(ies), how can we deny it really killed because of the science, yo. I mean c'mon! A BB movie with no cook? You yourself Vince, literally made the last scene of BB take place with Walter dying in a meth lab, his greatest love. Jesse could have escaped to Alaska later. No need for such a thin plot. It doesn't take away from the structure of the character. Bring back the chemicals! Hell maybe throw a few other people back in too. Would it hurt to show Walt Jr. living with Marie or something? Well, okay I'm not so sure about that, but before I sound off too much, I just wanted to say besides the new villain (and Todd too fat) I hated two more things. We already knew ages ago Jesse wanted to go to Alaska. Why not do something else, like make him go overseas? And although Robert Forrester is an incredible actor, I found it oddly stupid to bring back the vaccum repair routine (with the van parked outside, nonetheless, even after such a risk as helping White). The only reason I'm giving it 6/10 is because of Forrester and Paul and the mostly amazing actors (let's admit Plemmons has the perfect creepy balance of polite and wholesome and psychopathic). But unless they were going do something bigger, I saw no point. Walter White defined the evil in the every man (and woman, which I am. No need not to see through genders). Unfortunately Jesse didn't just get there. We should have just left him like Hunter S. Thompson said, "faster faster, until the thrill of the speed overcomes the fear of death." I actually don't know what to say about this movie. However, I really enjoyed it and I really think that it is necessary to be made so again Thank you Vince Gilligan. Although it is called A Breaking Bad Movie, but sometimes while watching it I felt like it is an extended episode of the series which I think it is a negative. However, this will not affect the rating of the movie too much, just by one point, so I an giving it a 9/10 rating. It's always amazing to see our favorite characters again, but honestly it's not because we like to see, that we should.
The end of breaking bad was epic. It was one of the best TV ending. All characters have their closure. The movie is not bad, it's nice. But doesn't have a purpose, Jessie story was closured. He got out. He was free. What happened to him after? Doesn't matter.
The end of this movie is technically the same that the end that he had on the show. Nothing new.
By saying that, the movie is good for the fans of the show to see once more their favorite characters, but it doesn't have anything relevant to add to the story. El Camino is only meant for the Breaking Bad fans who are left with the question: What will happen to Jesse Pinkman? This question gets a meager answer, in this movie which is basically just a long episode that never gets exciting.<br/><br/>The only good thing is that Jesse grew as a character and can hold the show on his own. Another satisfying part are the supporting cast who, with a minor part in this movie, still steal the screen when needed.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie has an ending that may feel sort of satisfying, but still leaves you with the same question: What will now happen to Jesse Pinkman? It is hinted that he finds peace, and that makes it worth it. But this is far from a good movie, and only for a limited audience.<br/><br/>Bye Jesse. You deserved a bang. Nothing really necessitates the existence of this movie, but it doesn't feel forced either. The somewhat nostalgic feeling of entertainment that stems from being enmired into the world of Breaking Bad for one more time is what makes this movie worth watching. Let's face it. This movie wasn't necessary. Don't get me wrong. I like it, and it really is a decent movie. But it exists only to make more money. I know that is just my opinion but i really think there are people who agree. The good thing about breaking bad was that the ending was planned from the beginning. Than why make an extra movie about jesse?<br/><br/>To sum things up, i do think it is a good movie but it just wasn't needed. And for all breaking bad fans, i do suggest to watch this movie. Just don't expect BB level cleverness Ok, so there's 1500+ written reviews and this is probably just a drop in the ocean...<br/><br/>But did anyone else find that Lojack scene contrived? Old Joe is scanning the El Camino for a Lojack - without explaining to anyone what he's doing. Suddenly the Lojack triggers - apparently it has just been "activated" by the company, or possibly the police. Is this an unforgivable coincidence or what? It activates at precisely the time Old Joe is looking for it!!!! If it had triggered even a minute before or after then the cops would have arrived unnanounced. What the hell Vince Gilligan. Be ashamed.<br/><br/>Or is it perhaps that Old Joe himself accidentally triggers the Lojack? Seems unlikely that he would be dumb enough to use a scanner that could in fact trigger the Lojack. This seems like a long shot, although this was in fact my first interpretation of the scene. I had to rewatch more than once. I'm pretty sure that Lojack only exists in America, so foreign audiences (including myself) have even less idea what is going on.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is the weakest scene in the entire movie and desperately needed to be dropped from the script. If the final season of Breaking Bad were an earthquake, this would be its aftershock. Not just because it follows chronologically, or because it's a less violent, traumatic event (though both are true), but because it's so essentially associated.<br/><br/>El Camino regularly calls back to events from the original series, revisiting characters, scenes and developments through a vibrant, smoothly-related series of flashbacks and memories. Like a serpent winding over the sand, writer/director Vince Gilligan delicately slithers through old scenery, adds a new layer of context, then immediately relates it to the present. It's a more elegant solution to the same problem HBO's Deadwood movie addressed earlier this year: how do we remind viewers of an important scene when it may have been a decade (or more) since they last watched it? HBO went at it with a hammer, slamming old footage abruptly into the mix, while Gilligan works with a scalpel, remembering and elaborating in the same breath. Fans of the series will, no doubt, relish the chance to re-visit this territory; to occupy the same space; to gain fresh perspective; to discover a new sense of closure. It moves like a TV program in film's clothing: expansive and deliberate, patient enough to chase those dangling threads, even if they divert from the greater narrative. Which, in this instance, works because that main storyline is rather simple. It's a loose end itself, left hanging when the series ended six years ago, but not a very long one.<br/><br/>As was often the case with the series, El Camino is all about rich character moments, fabulous cinematography and powerful acting. Aaron Paul is the film's constant, digging deep to deliver an impressive, nuanced performance that merits the extra screen time. He's joined by several strong supporting players - a few regulars from the show's prime and just as many bit players with newly-expanded roles - but those appearances always flicker and fade. This is Paul's show, and he brings the goods. I got the opportunity to watch this movie a few days ago and overall I would say I really enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>What worked for me: I really liked that every flashback for the most part at least, was relevant to the story and to how it would develop. In a way it takes a little time to get to the point but when the story and it's flashbacks start to coincide then the movie really picks itself up. And from there I would say it was really fun. Next, I really liked seeing old characters coming back and most of them playing a big part in the development of the present story. Next, the performances were for the most part just like they were in BB, and that is almost flawless. The only exception I will mention later. The story and directing were good and they really transmitted a message or a theme. That one of life purpose and I really dug that.<br/><br/>Things that didn't quite work for me: Todd and more explicitly the actor were very distracting to the point where I didn't believe anymore that he was a younger version but rather an older one. And staying on Todd, his performance throughout the movie was unecessarily villanous. Like the movie tries to give more reason than it's needed for you to understand why Jesse killed him at the end of BB. He basically treats Jesse like a trash and does things maybe his uncle would have done just to I guess emphasize the fact that he needed to die in the finale, which everyone already knew. Aside from that I would say it takes a little too long to get interesting and when it's the most interesting there is nothing dramatic or at least somewhat shocking but rather a tying of more loose ends, which to a certain degree I enjoyed.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say it's a good movie with a good send-off to Jesse that at times isn't as interesting as it could have been but which ultimately has a mesage for the audience. And that I really liked! 8/10 El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie stars Aaron Paul reprising his role as Jesse Pinkman. Now this review is goin to contain minor spoilers, but not major ones that's going to spoil the show and the movie. So if you haven't seen Breaking Bad than I suggest you watch that show and stay away from this interview until you've seen all six seasons. After the events of season six with Jesse escaping Jack and his Nazi gang, he is now branded a fugitive and his mission is to leave Alberque New Mexico and start a new life. Now I don't normally review Netflix movies, but since this takes place in the Breaking Bad universe, with Breaking Bad being one of my favorite shows, I think this is appropriate to discuss this. When I first heard that Vince Gilligan and his team were developing a Breaking Bad movie my first thought was why? Why do we need a Breaking Bad movie? The show was fantastic as it is that had a perfect ending, and wrapped the show up in a nice little bow. Why waste something on a perfectly good thing as a movie. But as I watched El Camino I think it was a nice, bittersweet farewell to Jesse Pinkman as he made his first appearance on the show from a laid back junkie to him finally growing up and moving on with his life. And what's great is that Vince Gilligan and his team respect the material they come up with and its not a movie where it feels rushed or they just released it to please Breaking Bad fans. Now is it better than Breaking Bad? Absolutely not. However it may not be good as Breaking Bad, but it does a great job of saying farewell to Jesse Pinkman, and that's all that matters. And also this makes me want to watch Breaking Bad all over again. So in the end, if you're a Breaking Bad fan, than this is an absolute must watch, but for all those who haven't seen Breaking Bad, and are watching this for the first time, I suggest you watch Breaking Bad, because you will be one hundred percent confused on what's happening. I have just finished watching Breaking Bad and it is easily one of the best TV Shows ever made and now I have watched the follow up in El Camino and I enjoyed this film though not to the same extent as I enjoyed the show. The premise of the film sees after the events of the Breaking Bad Season Finale Jesse Pinkman is attempting to evade the law and start his life over. Aaron Paul has reprised his role as Jesse in this film and he is honestly fantastic in this film, his performances improved as the show went on and his character has great depth in this film. You see how the events of Breaking Bad have affected him and no matter how hard he tries he can't fully move on from the show. This film has quite a few cameos in it from the show, I don't want to spoil them but they are all pretty cool to see and it is enjoyable and also a bit disturbing seeing Jesse interact with these characters. However, this is Jesse's film and nobody else really gets the chance to shine and the new characters aren't particularly interesting and it makes the film less interesting then it could have been. The story is interesting as it picks up very close to the events of Breaking Bad and it gives closure for people wondering what happened to Jesse Pinkman and it also allows the character to gain closure with other characters that maybe he didn't get on the show. However, I really wish either this film could have been longer or could have even been a small series to give it more time as the story feels a bit rushed compared to the show which had long term storytelling. The script is great with really great dramatic moments and dialogue that really help build the character of Jesse Pinkman, even with that slight charm and humour that the character has. The style is similar to Breaking Bad with its pretty real and dark demeanor but it feels very real and like a Breaking Bad sequel. Though as mentioned I thought the pacing was a bit off and I felt we could have got even more from this film. Overall this is a good followup that does a good job of following jesse Pinkman's Journey and giving fams of the show some closure. Breaking Bad lef a lot of things uncertain, things that fit perfectly in El Camino. It's a satisfying ending to a great story which I relived by watching the series again before the release. I wasn't dissappointed El Camino's purpose is to give us a closure of Jesse's side of things. Though his road was a rocky one filled with trauma and dread, he figures his way through it finally and reaches Alaska. This he does, with a little help from old acquaintances and a few last elimination of enemies which gets inevitable during the course of the movie. Its inevitable, because he is a man desperate for a second chance at life, and for someone like Jesse Pinkman, putting things right isn't a possibility anymore! He may merely just start over.
The movie does a great a job with this and is really well made. Aaron Paul proves to be an amazing actor and I'm sure if presented with a great role, will give us an award worthy performance. Some sequences are quite emotionally charged and makes one sympathise with those that society labels, "criminals". The end of the movie however, leaves us nothing but happy for Jesse. Walter aka Cranston was an amazing actor, it feels weird without his charismatic presence as Heisenberg, but Paul performance was decent. The movie's tempo is like BB and BCS, sometimes its slow, but the suspense is still there, even though the ending was easy to deduce. Also, camera angle, acting, and sequences was good enough to live up the legacy of greatest show of all time This movie was good, really enjoyed watching it and found it really entertaining, but didn't think it was necessary. The story and pacing is made well, you don't get bored and your always curious at what's going to happen and it was a perfect way to close up Jesse's journey, but what was great about breaking bass closing scene was keeping people wondering about Jesse. The movie ruins that moment but it was still entertaining to watch. An extended version of the show, very nice!<br/><br/>You need see the show to understand the film. This movie do justice to Jesse by wrapping up what was left hanging in BrBa. Simple storyline but yet very entertaining. I watched Breaking Bad after season 2, my sister gave me the dvds and I was off and running from there. Best TV show ever? This movie is about the main character, Jesse, who with Vince at the help I would sit back and understand he didn't finish the story. That's the mark of a good writer. We all want to see what happens to Jesse, because as Mr. White turned darker, he just wanted to escape. I love the tension, but sometimes Vince gives him too much leeway. In real America, this kid would be gagged and bound on day one. But you can't fault writing if you're ready willing and able to suspend disbelief, either a positive one, or a negative one. I don't do that, I just enjoy a movie that has closure. I really enjoyed this and thank Mr Gilligan for making it as it was clearly made for those who had 'stayed the course' as there was a minimal refresher at the beginning. Aaron Paul's acting was the highlight; he acts out a man barely containing his stress overload so well. The homage to the western climax (no spoiler!) was great and the ending just right. Robert Forster (who sadly died on the film's release date) did a great job in a scene which featured a regular theme in the original series: the wrapping of ordinariness around serious and complex situations. (You have to ignore the few pounds and grey hairs some of the actors have put on, but it's easy to suspend belief as the product is so strong.) Well screened, just as Breaking Bad is, detailed in story and this puts a full end of the story knowing what happens to Jesse, but it's nothing interesting. I can't even think of how to write a long review, it's just worth watching if you're a Breaking Bad fan, but you won't get that thrill. The only reason I gave it a 6, is because it's part of Breaking Bad. If it wasn't, the movie would have been way more worse. Just because you know some characters and the story will get you through the movie. But the script was too bad and it took way too long. Honestly it was a very boring movie. But it's nice to see what happens with Jesse after the series finale. All those fanboys need to improve their possibilities to form an honest opinion. This has nothing to do with the quality of the original serie, that one is still a classic. This is just an okay movie. This wraps up Jesse's story perfectly while also leaving some questions and possibilities for more things to happen in this world. But this movie was about closing the book on Jesse's and Walter's story. And it was beautiful at that. It was a really good movie, some plot holes though. Like how did Jesse get away from Todd? The last thing the audience is shown is Jesse giving Todd's gun back to him. And then this big search for the money hidden in Todd's apartment, even though we were only shown Todd saying he needs to find a better hiding spot than in the hollowed out books. Jesse finds the gun in the glove compartment and doesn't kill Todd, Todd has his money hidden in old dictionaries in his apartment. Next thing we're shown is Todd is dead and he hid his money in a different spot. Good movie but they left out a lot and left it up to the viewer to imagine. It's too bad  removed the forums, it'd be a great place to talk about this. But here is my review. Let's see if  has the courage to post it. A movie reiterating Jessie's ok and moving on with life.. it's a nice watch, I just would have loved seeing other characters, for example a scene of Walt jr on his birthday finding out his 10 mil richer from a "donation". Either way I'm happy for some more closure. It's seems like everyone gain some weight, Jesse would have been skinnier after that long period in cage, but he gain some weight instead,In breaking Bad it was attractive to be a criminal specially When Walter said to Scarlet
''All the things that I did, I did it for me, I liked it ''
Gilligan tried to show us the other side of crime world, Fear, darkness,mind conscience Lost, and loneliness, however I expected more solid version of Jesse Pinkman As a fan of a Breaking Bad, the whole movie is looking forward to the appearance of White. Although he finally appeared, but I am still lost in the scene.Really hope to see the next movie. It's an emotional epilogue of Breaking bad with a more mature Jesse Pinkman as the protagonist and a brilliant performance of Aaron Paul. Although the pace is a little slow this movie should satisfy most BB fans. It uses flashbacks featuring favorites such as Walt and Mike to interwine timelines as Jesse Pinkman goes on the run as the only remaining significant BB character. Closure for everything related to BrBa,One of the best show ever made, I binged watched that TV series but I was expecting more from this movie. After walt dies in final episode you feel sad but at the same time you feel happy for jesse who drives the car away from that place. It was simple story, could have been better. Disappointed. but loved aaron paul and actors who played his friends. I find it funny that i liked the movie more than many of the hard core fans, given that I was never crazy about BB. may be that is why. I did not expect much anyway. I knew that it is going to be only a subplot, and i knew that a movie can not be long enough to compete with the series.<br/><br/>BB revolutioized TV. El camino did not revolutionize cinema, it just moved the revolutionized TV series into cinema. If that is good enough for u, u will like it. It would have been a great episode of breaking bad.....as a movie, I'm sorry to say, it could have been much better. Photography is still something I'll be always fascinated, characters too....good job, really really good try. But the felling, the emotions breaking bad left us as s something so perfect nothing is going to take over. Well after being very excited, I now feel bored, and deflated!
El Camino bought forward high expectations, following what can only be described as one of the greatest series ever on neltflix, however I feel it didn't deliver!
A gripping start to the film soon tailed off, and the rest of the film had a start/stop feel about it. There were a couple of exciting moments where I thought.. 'here we go...' but these plot points ran flat quickly and were poorly executed! Quite frankly I feel the writers got bored, which is a great shame. This could of been 122 minutes of high energy, thrilling and exciting viewing!
Had I of just had a roast dinner, this would of been a great Sunday film to fall asleep to!
Overall I award it 6.3/10 Before I get into this review, I would like to say I am very much a Breaking Bad "fanboy" I adore the series and hold it up as the very pinnacle of television. However, when they first announced they were going to make a film about it, I was less than excited, as I thought the film could ruin the legacy the TV show left. But once I saw the trailer and the premise of just following Jesse Pinkman in the events that followed the conclusion of the TV series, I began to be excited, as the idea of a concise narrative surrounding one character could work well and provide good closure.<br/><br/>So, was I right to be excited? Well... yes. As a fan of breaking bad this film delivered everything it could possibly deliver in my eyes, it wraps up both Jesse's story and the franchise as a whole nicely, whilst providing some nice fan service along the way. The story works well, and it answers questions left by the end of the TV show, as it provides a beautiful farewell to Jesse Pinkman in the same way 'Felina' was a farewell to Walter White. My main gripe with this film is that I feel that sacrifices some of the quality of the film for some fan service, I won't say which as not to spoil the film, but I feel on some occasions it can take you away from the action unfolding surrounding Jesse for some fan service, but who am I really kidding as a die-hard Breaking Bad fan the fan service was great and I still loved every bit of it.<br/><br/>You can tell this film was a labor of love for Vince Gilligan and the team with some fantastic nods to the TV show, some more obvious than others. The cinematography was classic Breaking Bad with shots that perfectly resembled the TV shows shots, such as filming from the object's point of view as a character interacts with it and big wide shots of the landscape. Aaron Paul is predictably perfect in the role that made him a household name, along with the supporting cast portraying their characters brilliantly, whilst writing this I've just thought of another problem I have with this film, I can't remember a scene where Jesse utters the word "" and after just moaning about fan service, that would have been some more great fan service.<br/><br/>I can't think of much else to say about this film other than, if you are a fan of the series like me, this film will provide some great closure for you and you will enjoy the ride, as it's basically two good episodes of Breaking Bad played back to back.<br/><br/>8/10 Basically just two more episodes of breaking bad. Thoroughly enjoyable, but not especially profound. Its a finite conclusion to Jesses story with a few neat flashback to try and press you into Jesses state of mind at this point in the story. It fails somewhat, it might help if you binge the show then immediately watch this. I didnt and it felt a little flat. This movie depends on the way you see it, if you see it as a regular independent movie you will like it, if you see it from the general Breaking Bad perspective you will probably hate it especially if you're too much of a Walter White fan you still want to see his family reaction to his death and few scenes about him, if you look into it as a movie about Jesse Pinkman life you will love it. Generally it's a very good movie but it could've been better if they step up their drama game, all I saw is the suffering of Jesse nothing deeper than that and I say this cause I know how much of a great writer they're, so I judge them in a championship way. Breaking Bad is the greatest entertainment piece I've ever witnessed. A risk with the movie is that it could take away something from the perfect finale. With no suprise Vince Gilligan pull this off and made it clevery tied to the show but doesn't change anything from the finale. The movie isn't a masterpiece but I couldn't ask for a better epilouge or swan song. We got to see more conversations and cameos when you thought all was over back in 2013, that just make you smile that they really did this. Aaron Paul as Jesse is better than ever, showing how traumatic it has been living a life after being a slave for the white supremacist. This movie is an event and a love letter for the Breaking Bad fans. You never wanted it to end just like we felt about the show. But nothing last forever. I wonder what their rating would be. In my oppinion this is not a good film. The Mr. White scene was unnesessary and a lot of other scenes were there just to remind to the fans the original series Great movie, also the ending was perfect. I cant understand people complaining about it. What the hell did you expect ? Jesse going to war against the police like those crap action movies ? Great Job again Mr Vince Gilligan. The show gave me chills and ending the movie this way was a great idea. Even though Breaking Bad finished around six years ago, it still rates in my mind as the best TV show ever. It is perfect from start to finish, from the story, to the character development, to the cinematography, to the key moments of triumph, pain, and "OMG can't believe they did that".<br/><br/>That perfection led me to trepidation upon hearing that there was going to be a Breaking Bad movie. Too often Hollywood has done follow ups, reboots, and remakes that are empty and lifeless, and just come across as them playing on audience nostalgia to make a quick buck. Would the new Breaking Bad movie be the same, or would it be crafted with the same care as the TV series?<br/><br/>The teaser trailer allayed some of those fears and then the full trailer made me think that this might just be alright.<br/><br/>AND. IT. WAS.<br/><br/>El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie just got added to Netflix, and if you're a fan of the TV show, then I highly recommend that you watch it. This is one for fans - if you haven't watched the show then very little of this will makes sense. And don't worry if you've forgotten the details of the show there is a three minute recap up front that hits all the main points to set you up for what follows.<br/><br/>What follows picks up moments after the end of the TV series, and carries on with the same careful tone and well thought out development as the TV show. Aaron Paul is outstanding in it, and to see him change his entire acting style depending on whether we are in the present or a flash back was a sight to behold. In the flashbacks he really captured the young and enthusiastic misfit nature of the young Jesse Pinkman and is the stand out of the movie. All the acting is on point, with the scenes with Badger and Skinny Pete a standout.<br/><br/>What I thought was really clever about this is that while its a movie, it plays out like an extended TV episode. It lingers on certain moments longer that you would expect in a movie, and there is no movie-like three act format. And even with those lingering moments it doesn't drag, in fact it covers a lot of ground, while keeping the story moving along towards its conclusion.<br/><br/>So, in summary, if you loved the TV series, this a fitting follow up that brings with it all the stuff you loved, matches its tone and style, and is a perfect companion piece. Good storyline but not for a movie.. I did like it. But people who didn't watch breaking bad before wouldn't like it. Keep the spirit of "Breaking bad" and the rhythm of "Better call Saul". Thinking about it again I think it has more of "Bad" than of "Breaking" I am a fan of Breaking bad, not a huge fan just a casual fan. Therefore when this movie was revealed i was excited, but not as much as others and I didn't really have a lot of expectations. Now the movie is fine. It's well made and fine after and all that, but it doesn't feel necessary. Jesse's ending in the show was fine. He escaped and you could imagine yourself what happened. This movie never justifies it's existence. The movie has alot of flashbacks that mostly feel like filler and "look here is that character from the show and we brought them back" some of the actors have also aged alot since the show and it is very distracting in flashback scenes. So even though the movie is fine, it's too long and maybe not even necessary Surely worth waiting for. Funny thing, Vince Gilligan seems to be a Tarantino fan (both among the best writers of last 30 years). It's quite hard to believe that Quentin hadn't put his hands on the scenario. There's even one moment when Jesse speaks the words from Pulp Fiction. Inspired-by, being a-little-bit-of-tribute or just a wink-of-an-eye... or not. A must-watch for Breaking Bad's and Better Call Saul's aficionados. This could have been a short season 6 for BB instead of 2 hour movie. Maybe 6 episodes or so. As a movie it was not too exciting for an avg follower of BB but for fans it was pretty good. I re-watched the whole show, this time with my wife and only just finished the last episode 2 days before the movie came out. So seeing those characters looking much older in just over a day or two (also same time period of the show) was a little disappointing. however I gave it 8/10 as a fitting finale to the best tv drama show ever. Can't wait for Better call Saul's new season. Breaking Bad is a very important show to me. It's my favorite TV show, and it taught me a lot of things in life. It's been almost a year ever since I finished Breaking Bad, and now, El Camino: A Breaking Bad movie, comes out. This film is good. I thought the ending for Breaking Bad was perfect and ambiguous for Jesse and Walt, but this movie came out to show what happened to the characters out of almost nowhere I guess. Aaron Paul was so damn good in this film. His re-portrayal of Jesse Pinkman was so good it brings me back to Breaking Bad. There are numerous flashback scenes that include Todd, Walt and Mike, and those flashbacks are important because they affect the present in this movie, and that also brings me Breaking Bad vibes. The movie ends with Jesse moving to Alaska peacefully, after struggling to find cash for a fake identity. This was a good ending yes, and it was what many people (including me) expected right after the end of Breaking Bad, before this movie came out. I wish this film took more risks, but if this is what Vince Gilligan envisioned, then I respect that. Random thought: doesn't Walt look a bit different in the flashback scene? Like his shaved head seemed too perfectly shaved and he looked like a wax figure lmao. I don't know if that's just me but it doesn't affect my thoughts on the film. Was this movie necessary? Sure. I'm gonna give Breaking Bad an 8/10. This movie was a money grab for Vince. 100%. production values are not enough for a movie but too over the top for a tv episode. The continuity of the timeline is ruined with Todd's fat and his mullet uncle looks older. They extended scenes way beyond in movie time logic. Eg. Jesse takes 45 mins to say goodbye to skinny and badger and for some reason he's surprised by the police showing up so quickly? Him looking for the money was also just dragging on. Like, did we really need to watch him rip apart the whole apartment for 25 mins? Also, vacuum guy had to keep his ethos of being super secretive and he didn't. It's as if he just broke all his rules to make this filler piece. Besides, really, who cares what happened to Jesse after? We knew he escaped. The show is more about Walter than Jesse. This was complete a waste of time. Netflix knows it's time is over by pumping out quantity over quality. Families are always rising and falling in America. This is just netflixs turn to bow out since prime is winning all the Emmys for series. This film allows to clone once and for all the fable of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>It's been years since I finished the series, but watching the movie, I could remember all the things that had me so much at the time. We find in fact the structure, the staging and intelligence that made Breaking Bad successful at the time.<br/><br/>This film is a big YES for me. After all these years and all these shows, braking bad still get you excited.
Will miss Mr White and Pinkman. This movie is brilliant and I love it, especially since I've seen the series. If you haven't seen the series don't watch the movie it's got massive spoilers I thought it was great, simply put. People, they all have an idea of what they want to see and sometimes that doesn't pan out, which is true of a lot of things. Sometimes its a general screw up by the director, the producer, the show-runner, etc. Sometimes politics plays a part, as most of Hollywood is a dream world these days and we get sjw cringeys like Batwoman and The Shannara Chronicles.<br/><br/>But this time, i think some were just disappointed that some things were left out. Maybe this or that character wasn't in it, or this or that idea wasn't the plot, just the little things that they felt should have been in the movie.<br/><br/>With that said I found I did enjoy it immensely, i thought it was like one reviewer stated, 3 shows all at once.<br/><br/>Usually when a movie is really good i will re-watch it, if it isn't then its a one and done deal.<br/><br/>I watched El Camino twice. Dear Brock -- How's it hanging, little man?!! So SO sorry about you being poisoned and orphaned and all because of your mom's association with me and now you're back in the gang neighborhood with Grandma and in 5 years you're Tomas, but I'm SURE this greeting card from your loving Uncle Jesse will fix all that right up!<br/><br/>Never mind that my last two girlfriends are dead cuz of me, your life is destroyed cuz of me, Ive murdered multiple people (and even added to my body count on my way out of town!), I've twisted that knife one last time with my parents by lying to them (yet) again, and I've voluntarily made thousands of pounds of the worst drug you can imagine, I'm all smiles now and off to a fresh start in Alaska!!!!! Yeah, <br/><br/>So, have a great life, little man, 'Kay?!!! I'm sure you will !!!!! Love, your BFF 4eva!!!!! - Jesse Why did we need closure for Jesse? Let's face it, most of what happened was his own doing. The character was on a self-destructive bent from season 2. All Walt ever did was try to save his time and again. Jesse never grateful. Always an emo or acting like a spoiled brat. But always drawn back to Walt and making meth.<br/><br/>Why couldn't Jesse break bad and become a version of Heisenberg? Or maybe even allude to it in the final scene? So you see Jesse from the drivers window, driving off, and then the camera pans around to the back of the car, and we can see boxes of lab equipment..... roll credits. Now THAT would have been a perfect end to his story arc. I thouroughly enjoyed this movie even though critics have a boner to give a hot take on how it was not worth their precious time. Breaking bad is and forever will be my favourite show of all time. Hands down. From the pilot episode to the finale I was gripped by the well written characters and fantastic performances. Nothing has even come close since and it's going to take alot for something to top. Now 5 years later we come to El Camino. A movie that despite my love for the show, I was skeptical about to say the least. Mainly due to the fact that I wasn't sure what was left to tell from this world. After watching the film do I feel that it was necessary? Well yes and no, allow me to explain.<br/><br/>One of my biggest compliments to this film is the fact thay it "Feels" like breaking bad. The actors all slip back into the skin of these characters flawlessly, Aaron Paul is great as usual. The cinematography is fun and stylistic, there are a number of montages that are uniquely presented and have fun music choices. The movie is also extremely slow paced, and I mean that as a huge compliment. You see that's one of the things that made breaking bad so great. It took its time with its story and wasn't afraid to let scenes play out for uncomfortable amounts of time. I was afraid that this was going to be some fast paced action movie or something, so I was pleasantly surprised that the movie wasn't afraid to take its time just like the show. All these aspects lead to a very authentic feeling breaking bad movie that slips right into the continuity of the show.<br/><br/>With all that said the movie is not perfect. While it is fun to go on one last ride with one of the most sympathetic characters of television. In the end I cant help but feel this movie lacked any consequence and didn't really take any risks with the story. It was pretty by the books honestly. One thing that made breaking bad so brilliant is the writers were seemingly writing themselves into holes that us as an audience could not even begin to guess how they were going to get out of it. But somehow Gilligan would find a way everytime in some brilliant way. El Camino has nothing like that. There is a moment halfway through the movie were it seems as though Jessie is going to be arrested. And I was so pumped beacuse I had no idea how they could get Jessie out if it, and it felt like something that would happen in breaking bad, but nope it ends up being a fake out.<br/><br/>The movie also feels pretty pandering at times, mainly with the flashback/Cameo moments. The Mike scene at the beginning felt right to be included and set the tone for the rest of the film, however the same can not be said for Walt and Jane's scenes. As much as I love seeing Bryan Cranston as this character once more and the scene itself was pretty good, it didn't really need to be included and served no purpose to the overall story. Same goes for the Jane scene which was just plain cringe.<br/><br/>Overall if you have watched breaking bad, see this movie. And if you haven't seen breaking bad, watch breaking bad and see this movie. I may have my problems with this film but the fact is this movie feels like an extended episode of breaking bad, which is all us fans can ask for really. Ever had something so good that you want a taste of it once again? So you keep longing for it and keep fantasizing how awesome it's gonna be the next time you'll have it again. Breaking bad is one such television series that would make you beg for more. It's so good it ruined television for the next couple of years for a lot of viewers. People longed for answers. People wanted certain histories of others. There was all kinds of anticipation and during that time came "Better call Saul". You may not get the Breaking Bad vibe all over but a bit of familiar faces eases the urge for nostalgia. It had Mike (A character we all wanted to know about - lot of opportunities to explore) Gus, Tuco etc., There was potential and Vince took it.<br/><br/>El Camino - An ode to Jesse. Yes that's all it is. A definitive closure for a spectacular character and a grand goodbye to a soul that hurt the most in the entire series. We needed that, but it wasn't worth the effort or the hype for a sequel.<br/><br/>We tasted something so good with breaking bad that after so much longing when they said they were bringing this movie, we couldn't help but expect the original. Looking at Fat Todd, Walter with no meaningful presence and finally a very very paper thin story of "How Jesse escapes police hunt and run to Alaska" wasn't sufficient. It's good to see the folks again though. I just hope Vince won't make movies on how Marie moved on from Hank and How Skylar changes identify or how Walter Jr. faces bullying and rise above his breakfast addiction. It's ok to leave viewers to their fantasy endings for their beloved characters. There is a beautiful solace in that. Breaking Bad is far and away my favorite TV-Series of all-time, and honestly might be my favorite piece of media in any field (film, TV, books, games, etc.) period. It's that god-damn good and has had a profound impact on my life. So needless to say, aside from Avengers: Endgame and Joker, El Camino was easily my most anticipated film of the year. The beginning is fantastic, though most of it was already revealed in teasers -- we get a cameo from Mike and a heartfelt conversation to follow suit between him and Jesse in a flashback. It's a good scene, but it's impact on the conclusion of the film is questionable to say the least. Then we get Jesse screaming and losing it in the El Camino like at the end of Felina, and it reminded just how damn good of an actor Aaron Paul is, you really feel his pain. The rest of the scenes at Skinny Pete's are flawless and I wouldn't change them a bit.
Then we enter flashback territory, and this is where issues do start to come up with the film as others' have noted. Elephant in the room, Jesse Plemmons (Todd Alquist), is clearly way more overweight than he was in the finale of Breaking Bad. And it's not to fat-shame him, but it is very distracting and breaks the illusion quite a bit -- I mean, look at some of the stuff actors have done for physical appearance consistency in film in the past. It's insane. And realistically he'd just have to drop 20-25 pounds and I think it'd be fine; so we're not even talking night and day -- it's just super weird to me that Vince Gilligan was fine with this considering how meticulous he's been with Breaking Bad in the past.These flashback scenes are okay in their own right, but Aaron Paul is the only real interesting thing in them often times, I think these scenes are why some people are describing the movie as slow. The best parts of it revolve around Jesse's mental state and even the signs of PTSD he has from being held captive. We get some new characters in the form of antagonists to Jesse's pursuit to get enough money for Ed the Disappearer to give him the treatment he gave Walt and Saul. These characters are pretty damn weak if I'm being honest, and I really don't care for them.
Aaron Paul is perpetually saving this movie, and that pains me to say, but it's just the truth. We get a major shocker from a Bryan Cranston cameo as Walt again, it's so cool to see him in character again, almost to an emotional level -- but the scene he and Jesse shared left a lot to be desired.
And of course, as we could all predict -- Jesse ends up with a fresh start in Alaska. It is so heartwarming to see, even if predictable, I love this charter so much that it just puts a big smile on my face.
All in all El Camino is a solid film, good cinematography, really creative sequences, and Aaron Paul murders everything he's given to work with -- but often times that's not much. I am a bit disappointed, and I don't think this movie is a necessity to the series, but it doesn't ruin anything either. From Fat Todd to that really weird Western stand off climax, this whole thing is pretty suspect at times, but I'm glad I watched it just to see Jesse happy again, If I wasn't a Breaking Bad, I'd definitely rate it lower, but that just goes to show the impact that the show has. See it if you're a fan, otherwise you may want to pass.<br/><br/>7/10 This is my first ever review of anything on IMDb.
I need to say the following: this is a fantastic movie!
I've read a few of the reviews, and some say that they are not happy with the ending of this movie; "what was the point? I wanna know what happens after!"<br/><br/>Also: I've seen some reviews complaining about the "flashbacks" which have been recorded all these years later, but really -- what is there to complain about? I think they did it absolutely perfectly. To see all of these actors ones more get into the roles of these characters, I think that is absolutely awesome. Sure, they have aged as some reviewers pointed out, but who cares? Just enjoy the movie. It's a nearly perfect homage to Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I watched Breaking Bad for a long time (like many of its fans), and built "a relationship" with the series. When the series ended, everything went to absolute bad. Lets call it "a bad break-up". Now, all these years later you get a chance to re-visit this "relationship", which brings me to how I would sum up the entire movie with just one word:<br/><br/>Closure. This is a must watch for everyone who has seen Breaking Bad series because it continues the story of Jesse Pinkman. I enjoyed the movie even if it was a little bit slow in the beginning, maybe because it showed many things that happend during Jesse's imprisonment. The movie also shows what a monster Todd is, probably to justify Jesse's revenge at the end of the series.
The greatest part came in the 2nd part of the movie when the "western" scene took place and I am not going to lie.. It was pretty awesome.
I also appreciated the fact that they brought Walter in this movie and showed a very familiar discussion between these two partners.
The ending was nostalgic and it reminds the viewer that Jesse went through a lot of crap to end up like this.
Overall the movie was a success and I rate it 8/10 but I wouldn't recommend this to those who haven't seen the Breaking Bad series. In the end everything is basically the same but satisfying....I was a bit worried after hearing that Netflix is gonna make a movie about What happened to Jesse next...I thought they might ruin the most satisfying ending in television history..but i had a belief in Vince Gilligan and it lives up to my expectations....Though it is more of a character study, but it manages to add some footages from BB and the iconic scene where Jesse and WW met at a restaurant..I couldn't stop tears in my eyes in this scene.....Todd is sick and in retrospect deserved a worse death than he got in BB... BB series was great. Exciting, suspenseful and full of tension. El Camino turned out to be quite the opposite to me. The movie started off great and I expected it to be like "The Fugitive" Ã  la Gilligan.<br/><br/>However the excitement started to die off slowly after Jesse left his car with Skinny Pete. (we're re-introduced to Badger and Skinny P, but we won't know what happens to them afterwards. The scene where Skinny Pete was interrogated in the teaser has obviously been cut, and Badger's won't be heard from again either). No major issues there but it would have been interesting to see (even briefly) how their lives are impacted again from helping Jesse. Also it would have added the feeling of pressure from the police or DEA, and make us root for Jesse even more.<br/><br/>After that scene with the trio, we move on to the second (of many) flashback this movie has. Putting aside Todd's weight gain, the flashback themselves are only used to make up past event serving to drive El Camino's story forward.
I find this use of flashbacks a poor choice for such a legendary story that is Breaking Bad. The whole Todd and Jesse going to the apartment to move the maid's body, the money, takes up way too much screen time and doesn't tell anything worthwhile. It isn't exciting either or interesting when you find out what it's all about admit it.<br/><br/>This brings me to my issue with the plot. When I understood that Jesse is trying to escape by paying Ed the vacuum guy, it felt a bit lazy from a screenwriting point of view. I mean Ed felt like this untouchable guy, like a 'joker' in your deck of cards that you can just use to end the game. Knowing you'll end the movie that 'easily' using 'Ed the joker' writing the flashback parts weren't really creative or researched either. It could have been anything. Thus using Ed to end it all was a bad idea.<br/><br/>The flashbacks would have worked better if they added to the story or gave us some nostalgia moments (like seeing walt poison brock etc.) , however in El Camino, the whole plot rests on those flashbacks. Without them the movie wouldn't make sense. In addition to being too many of them, they slowdown the story as flashbacks generally do, and takes all the excitement and tension of the present moment; which is Jesse Pinkman being on the run from police and the DEA. We don't even see or feel the DEA's presence for crying out loud. Nor do we feel the threat of the police like at the beginning. Which is why I'm saying a 'the fugitive' approach would have been great for 'El Camino'<br/><br/>After the whole shebang and Jesse getting a share of the money from Todd's fridge (thanks to the fake cop whose made up story will be introduced in another flashback later on). We learn that he is short $1800 and Ed is playing hard to get. I mean, of course Ed had to play hard to get, otherwise the movie would have ended after 30mins. But let's be realistic, him refusing to take Jesse for a couple of grand short is just convenient because the ending is weak.<br/><br/>1h20min approx into the movie, and nothing much has happened when you look at the big picture. The scenes are all nice and well written, but when you consider that it's all leading up to buying a one way ticket with Ed the vacuum man, then it makes those scenes appear somewhat weak. An 'all that for this' kind of feeling.<br/><br/>To recap: The movie is good, introducing Jesse's Alaskan dream early in the movie gives us something to root for. The acting is good as you'd expect, well shot and beautiful as you'd expect also. The director (a living legend) however, hasn't written his best piece with El Camino. The story relies way too much on flashbacks that aren't that great, and the ending felt too easy. In other words, they played it very safe with the story/ending.<br/><br/>...and like Mike said in the opening flashback (the only acceptable flashback in my opinion), Jesse is a 'teenage retiree' with a lot of cash driving off in the Alaskan beauty. I want to start off by saying that I absolutely don't hate this movie, I can't. Although no matter how much I want to love it, I am unable to raise an appreciation of such kind for this movie. I knew I was going to be biased when watching this and yet there are some issues that keep bothering me throughout the entire movie, and here's some of them:
Mike looks significantly older in the flashback, hard to avoid of course, time passes in 6 years, right?
Todd has aged even worse, he also grown fat, and that is my probably my biggest issue.
Even Jessie looks older, and a bit chubby should I say? This works for the older Jessie, who's suffered physical and psychological stress, but keep in mind that this is not what Jessie should look like in the flashbacks.
In terms of plot I really felt that there was a lack of redemption for Jessie. There is not much thought given about his life being basically destroyed by Walt and the neo-Nazis and how he is coping with it. There is some PTSD-tendencies but that's that.
The new villains are not that intimidating, and quite coincidental. It would feel more realistic if there was a part of the neo-Nazi group (obviously there should be more people part of that network then the 8 getting killed) seeking revenge for Walt's massacre and for that reason killing what's left to kill, which is Jessie. And Jessie must evade these guys while at the same time being chased by the police kind of The Fugitive-style. Imagine that!
There are things that worked, for example:
The scene with Jane and also the scene with Walt is beautiful. Walt basically looks the same, and I wonder why they didn't take the opportunity to use the only character who still looks the same for more flashbacks in this movie, considering Todd is useless apart from the reason to establish the hidden money plot-tool.
The ending is realistic, I would not change that. It would be even better with a huge amount of catharsis. I almost fell asleep! Too many useless flashbacks! Aaron Paul, Robert Forster and Jesse Plemons deliver strong performances to anchor El Camino, which sees the Breaking Bad story continue to Jesse Pinkman's last stand. Familiar faces return, and this will definitely be one of the defining movies of 2019.<br/><br/>7.5/10 Way too long and overall a bore unfortunately. Shouldn't have made it I'm afraid Boring. Slow. Basically a long episode of Breaking Bad. Not a movie at all. Too many scenes that weren't of any consequence to the plot of said "movie" that seemed like filler material. Oh, did I mention it was long? Story of his escape: THERE IS NOT STORY.
empty movie.
dont watch it. I hated the storyline and it downgrades the breaking bad line up! I'm giving 3 stars because I found the cinematography really interesting otherwise the movie sucked and made no sense It's not just a question of high expectations, the sequel to Breaking Bad is disappointing because it's lousy. A hash of flashbacks, flashbacks within flashbacks, followed by flash-forwards in a dizzying, convoluted mess. The director apparently thought he could keep the viewer on track by providing different haircuts and/or different stocking caps for poor Jesse. A number of plot lines are introduced and never followed through on (cut for length?), but the viewer hardly notices it in the mishmash of time changes. I'd mention a couple but I don't want a spoiler alert to keep people who haven't seen it from wasting their time. Does the movie have glimpses of the taut drama and gallows humor that distinguished Breaking Bad: Yes. Is it worth slogging through two hours for them: No. Stay away. My heart breaks to write this but my god why did they do this? Is there some deeper level that I don't grasp? I'm a passionate fan of the series and believe me I know Pinkman character in and out and I didn't see him in this 'master piece'. just AP flexing his acting muscles. Where is that unique creative spark that made the show what it was and still is?????? Where is the STORY??? Apparently without Bryan Cranston all falls apart. For me Breaking Bad ended with Baby Blue and with perfection. This just tarnished the legacy. And for God sake STOP saying that all fans love this. This one surely didn't! A good ending to the story. I wanted to see more , but it is good After I finished watching the movie this morning, I asked my self why do we need this movie ?
I mean the cinematography is good, but the movie at all is pointless .. like what happened in GOT in the last season ..
Vince left for us an open end in breaking bad when we talk about Jesse and it was amazing .. why do you have to close it ? .. let us still asking what happened to Jesse ? Let us make our ending or at least close it well .. I didnt expect that .. it was cold ending .. I didnt felt the hype, I felt nothing actually ..
It's not a movie though, just a stretched episode ..<br/><br/>The overall performance was a little bit cold, pinkman family, badger, skinny even Jesse himself .. maybe I felt that because every things in the movie happened too fast .. quick scene for skinny and badger .. same for pinckman family .. and so on ..
Too many flashbacks ..<br/><br/>I really felt disappointed .. Beautiful movie to look at
extremely well directed
Incredible performances
And super satisfying and emotional Overacting, terrible cinematography, too long, nothing happens, cheap cgi etc. I've never watched Breaking Bad simply for the fact I don't have cable. However, I acquired this title because of its reputation and hoped it would stand alone as a movie. It doesn't. Things happen, situations are in place, and characters behave in ways you won't get unless you've watched the TV series. Almost one hour into the movie and I had NO IDEA what the motivation of the players were or why they were in their situation in the first place. These important things are NEVER explained because the producers ASSUMED you watched the show so all the characters may as well had been wearing pink tutus and dancing the macarena on Wall St. for all I care. Well that was boring... Nothing special unless you're a huge Breaking Bad fan. I think this movie Destroy the end of the series
Not nesesery movie at all i dont like it at all. El Camino isn't bad to the point you'll regret watching it, in fact it can be interesting if you liked Breaking Bad, but as a stand-alone production there's nothing really special about it. I was expecting a movie with same intensity like the TV show, but its far from that. Its really slow, poor acting, too manny "Fillers" in the movie. Some scenes are too long and tooooo many flashbacks, its basically a flashback movie. I was bored and i was not expecting it to be that bad. Most of us who've viewed this movie had tons of time invested in the Breaking Bad series. With that and the fact we've all had years to ponder & come to our own conclusions about about what we believed a post Breaking Bad world looked like (in this case especially for Jesse) I can see where maybe this didn't meet their mental picture they created.<br/><br/>I believe when Jesse escaped people believed (or wanted to) he was going to ride off into the sunset and live the happy life most views thought he deserves and wanted to see (especially considering what he experienced the last months of the series).Those people however didn't throughly think things out. Jesse still had tons of obstacles he would have to climb (especially with law enforcement), not in order to forget his past but to put it in his rearview mirror.<br/><br/>Those who've been unsatisfied with the movie or responed with negative reviews are people who refused to accept any BB story that didnt match whatever conclusion they've already come to before for movie was first talked about or released.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, it was well thought out, and it gave a realistic conclusion to the story. The question that comes after the Series Finale is "what happened to Jesse once the series end?". That is what this movie is about. You get your answer. All while sprinkling characters from the show including some minor ones. Some may want to watch the finale before viewing El Camino. I was trying to answer questions with the people I was watching this with as it played. The movie has the feel of Breaking Bad and the movie has those twists you would expect from Breaking Bad. It's not going to knock you off your chair, but you should enjoy it. They shouldn't have killed Walter White off and made this a high budget thriller involving all main cast. But like I said, happy to have something. Don't expect too much in the way of pyrotechnics or head-spinning scenes. This is a respectful slow-paced movie that closes the chapter on a piece of TV history. It cements Gilligan as a true auteur for our times. Suspenseful, beautifully filmed and at times emotional. Don't listen to the naysayers. This is a masterpiece. Not to sure what to write, it was good to see Jesse , badger and skinny Pete again but that was it, there were some good moments but I found myself clock watching a lot, not as good as our beloved breaking bad unfortunately Let's just start off by saying, I'm a huge fan of BB, which is one of, if not the best TV-show ever put to screen. Did we really need this movie though? I didn't really find it that exceptional, too be honest. If you loved the show, you probably would want to see this film, just keep your expectations in check. It's not bad, but not great either. If you loved BrBa, you'll enjoy this movie. If you thought BrBa was so-so, you'll still probably like it. It brings the closure to anyone wondering where Jesse went at the end of the series and tells the story in a way that keeps you interested. Don't expect an action film when you go into it, expect to see the Felina for Jesse. It may not have you on the edge of your seat but it doesn't need to, hence the 10/10 rating. It's a perfect conclusion to Jesses story who has gone through so much pain that we aren't fully aware of in the series. By the end of his film you feel you have a broader understanding of Jesses mindset that is heavily focused on. SPOILER:
the small scene with Walt was also a nice touch to see them in a calmer environment than usual and this gave a heartwarming effect The movie gives you the all forgotten perspective of Jesse Pinkman - his captivity, escape and his survival afterwards. Jesse turns into a more seasoned criminal, although stumbling along the way, but still recovering and finally acheiving the end he deserved. Some cool Cinematography and Screenplay at work, with Vince Gilligan showing why he is still revered for the series. All in all, not only 'A Netflix Event', but also an Event in its own!!! Amazing and just what I expected. A great and truly in-depth look at how Jesse gets his closure. This was perfect for me. Awesome addition to the phenomenal "Breaking Bad" story! Just enough details and excitement -- nothing overdone or trite, the exact stellar quality you'd expect from the producers of Breaking Bad. This is the last exciting drama I can recall, that doesn't jam political agendas and rainbow flags into every story line, so this installment was just what the doctor ordered. I'm not going to go into any real plot details so as not to spoil the ending of Breaking Bad. Instead, I'll just say that El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (or just El Camino for the rest of this) tells Jesse Pinkman's story immediately following the events in the series finale.<br/><br/>The thing I absolutely loved about El Camino was seeing Aaron Paul play Jesse Pinkman one more time. I thought he was good in the series - as good as Bryan Cranston - but here, he takes his acting up a notch. Watching him play the beaten and frightened Jesse, it's truly amazing. I could almost feel the pain Jesse was going through. Paul doesn't even speak much for a big hunk of the first part of the movie, but he's still able to express his feelings quite clearly. It's really an acting masterclass from Paul.<br/><br/>The plot is okay. It's a very slow moving film with just a couple of action set-pieces to break up the drama. But while it may be slow, it ever feels like a long movie. It's about the fastest 2+ hours I've spent watching a movie recently. When the action does come, it's expertly handled just as you'd expect from Vince Gilligan. And the ending is perfect. Gilligan fittingly wraps up Jesse's story as neat and tidy as you could hope.<br/><br/>My main complaint is that El Camino never really feels like the big movie I was hoping for. Not that that's a bad thing, but I expected more. Breaking Bad told a larger than life story with outlandish characters, incredible dialogue, over-the-top violence, and amazing plot twists. El Camino, in comparison, is much more laid back and doesn't feature a lot of the elements that I loved in the show.<br/><br/>The other thing that bothered me about El Camino was all the fan service. Other than Jesse, all of the other characters / actors have little more than cameos. It was nice to see some of them again, but a lot of them don't do much.<br/><br/>6/10 BrBa, BCS and now El Camino sets the top of the top. Amaizing masterpiece. Superb, visually stunning and brilliantly acted. The early scenes with Skinny Pete were some of the best in the whole Breaking Bad universe. Fantastic, we need more!!!! Was just ok, why didn't Jesse rob someone for the 1800$, the welding guys were unnecessary. Also, Jesse didn't want to kill more so why did he just accept to the duel.
Also, they could've hidden Todd's belly. It was not convincing that it took place before the finale.
First half was good.
Vince Gilligan didn't take any risks, sticked to safe bets so the fans wouldn't get upset.
Story wasn't worth telling.
After the finale, they shouldve just shown Jesse in Alaska.
Left with a sour taste in my mouth This movie is nothing like breaking bad.Bb was badass, violent, chaotic.
But every story's gotta end right?
El camino focuses on Jesse pinkman.Jesse was never a man of violence,he knew when to quit,he knew how to take responsibility.<br/><br/>First half of the movie is really slow,it immediately starts off with an antagonist and protagonist.
last half of the movie is when the story picks up pace,there are max. 2 nerve wrecking moments in this half.We see Jesse ties every loose ends before going to the final frontier.You will see familiar faces from breaking bad one last time,the characters related to Jesse's life who ACTUALLY cared for him.<br/><br/>This movie is for jesse, not for walter,and for his movie,this movie did Justice to him.<br/><br/>0%meth,100% friendship.
Shot beautifuly from start to end.
Aaron did an awesome job. I will keep my review short and without spoilers as I am probably part of the few who have already finished watching and writing a review. Vince is back at it again with a phenomenal delivery. The storyline is well structured, reasonably paced and interesting, there is a familiar tension when watching which takes you back to the suspense of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>A few characters make a comeback but the movie is primarily focused on Jesse. This movie is packed with action, suspense, nostalgia and emotion. A bittersweet yet perfect conclusion to the series. At present the only writer and director working with the AMC network to create the highest quality dramas that are capable of competing with the HBO ORIGINALS... As good as it was to see old characters this was a very boring and not needed film. Please don't watch this if you haven't watched breaking bad as one you won't get it and two you won't want to watch breaking bad. The sequel to the greatest drama of all time
But
Don't expect breaking bad quality Both my wife were expecting a lot, but nothing really happens. A few things cleared up, a lot of returning to the past....and the acting was good. Nevertheless we were really disappointed. Dear me, not movie material. It would have made a better TV one hour slot. So slow and several drawn out scenes could have been shortened severely or culled altogether. Nothing to say, don't watch it! Boring and nothing like the series i use to remember. I have watched Breaking Bad at least 50 times. It's always playing in the background when I don't know what else to play. So you can see I am a huge fan. However, this film was not good. It was super slow, Jesse had lost his character completely. In the series, he was all about no violence, (especially violence for money) come on.. I also didn't always understand when it was supposed to be a flashback because they were all so fat and out of shape and it was hard to imagine it was supposed to be before. I think it would have been best to end BB as series. First off Aaron Paul as Jesse flawless he is an amazing Actor and brings his everything to the role but Vince Gilligan falls short unable to capture the magic which made his beloved series so great he uses flashback as a clutch to further a story that the fizzles out not even 45 minutes in using 25 minutes of flashbacks to progress the story 2 minutes giving unnecessary information of what happened during his time captive for little to no narrative on what's happening now a little bit of info so he can find money and a flash back for a person who lives close to Todd to show us he is a lonely old man who watches people and looks for any sort of human contact is very unneeded and very lazy on the part of Vince Gilligan in the writing and you think that with the amount of flash backs it would give some sort of look at what's happening but no just time fillers leading to the exact same ending as the show Jesse riding off into the sunset just a different sunset but safe feeling except for the show it was a good ending for the movie it left me feeling cheated that 6 years and that's all we get is Jesse riding off into Alaska skipping the part where he crossed multiple borders just for a easy ending the show was a masterpiece and this movie had the chance to live up to that but due to poor writing it failed to even come close the only thing that made it breaking bad was the characters which all around great acting just wish the writing was on par I wasn't a die hard fan of Breaking Bad but I enjoyed watching all the seasons of series. I supposed the ending of the series was somehow plausible and enough, that's why I wasn't really expecting another sequel to it. On top of that, a breaking bad movie without the main character ,Bryan Cranston, wasn't something I was looking for, although I was eager to watch the movie.<br/><br/>Ever since being captivated, the long and excruciating days for Jesse Pinkman began. He was rescued by Walter White in the last season of the series and the story of the movie begins with Jesse escaping. Throughout the escaping, he keeps having flashbacks of his harsh days and in some scenes it is obvious how it affects his decisions and behaviors.<br/><br/>I didn't recall many events from the series for it was a long time ago when I finished watching the whole seasons, however, for me it was a pleasurable experience. There are copious amounts of information and videos about the summary of Breaking Bad series, so I recommend you to get all the gists before watching the movie.<br/><br/>The story wasn't really replete with twists and it followed a very simple yet interesting story with fabulous scenes and I think that's what makes it outstanding. I wished I could watch this movie right after I finished watching the series but anyway, it was a joyful feeling to watch more Breaking Bad! El Camino is something I have been longing for a long time; some closure on what happened to Jesse after the ending of Breaking Bad. This movie does just that. I went into this movie knowing it couldn't fit everything that made Breaking Bad so perfect in about 2 hours. It's just not possible. El Camino gave me what I wanted, and I am more than happy with what I got. You won't get bored at all. Its a nice continuation of breaking bad. Breaking Bad is my favorite TV show, but I felt absolutely nothing in this movie.
Nothing happens, the writing is poor and doesn't take any risks.
When I learned it was actually the same writer as in the series, I was just stunned. How could it be the same guy ? Why is this movie not interesting at all ?<br/><br/>Well, maybe it was time to stop with this universe. And they didn't.<br/><br/>Jesse is just looking after a bunch of money, and we get some flashbacks too, overall it's completely useless and a waste of time.<br/><br/>I give 3 stars to cinematography, but don't watch it, you'll miss nothing. It really didn't add anything to the series just added another episode that explained what happened with Jessy Pinkman and kinda made the character look weak I would have preferred it just ended with the series. Skinny Pete's part was cool he's a hero! Just milking breaking bad now. Completely boring and seems like it was made up as they went along. I am a massive fan of Breaking Bad and was so excited for this movie but ended up gutted! Jesse has been in a cage for a year but somehow lost no weight at all, loads and loads of boring flashbacks! Just wish they had left it alone instead of making a bad movie for money.<br/><br/>How anyone can HONESTLY rate this higher than a 4 is beyond me, I can only come to the conclusion that they are paid reviews which is even more depressing The acting and production quality was good, as expected, but the story doesn't bring much to the table. The movie ends without really making any mark. I'm a fan of the series because it the characters remains them self. The series is made with precision.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't make sense.
The CAR lowjack system activated exactly at the moment they were checking it?
Fake cops come to the house of Todd exactly at the moment Jesse is there
Neighbor comes to the house of Todd exactly at the moment Jesse is there
Badger and Skinny carry thousands of dollars with them.. really?
The disappear guy scene asking for more money doesn't make any sense..
Also, it is not Jesse to really disappear after all that happened.. He would try to safe Brock and then go back using drugs.. just like he did many times in the series. He has nothing left.<br/><br/>The shootout part is just a joke.. I think Vince Gillian just sold his name to this movie and nothing more. Breaking Bad is comfortably my favourite all time tv show. Its the only series I've watched from start to finish. The story telling and rich characters are unparalleled on the small screen. El Camino however is an afterthought. Not a movie more a stitched together final two episodes made way after the event. I so desperately wanted to like this but it feels very indulgent and pointless. The story is thin and the characters just don't resonate. Bring on the next Better Call Saul to restore the faith. Nice to have a bow on it and all, but literally nothing happens in this film, really disappointed and surprised people's are singing its praises I felt like no time had passed and things picked up perfectly where they left off. This was a nearly flawless film. I loved immersing myself back in this world. Aaron Paul is even better than before, and that's saying something. Yeah science! A mediocre movie, on the most boring protagonist of an overrated tv show.
I, as everyone else, have seen the tv show. I found it bland and overrated. This movie was not better. On the contrary, it was far worse. The script is terrible, completely self indulging. Acting is also poor on all sides. I don't understand how much of a blind fanboy you have to be, to rate this an 8, equal to classics like godfather, but hey, who am i to judge. Breaking Bad is iconic and the pair of lead characters became cultural legends. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) captivated audiences for years, they decided to focus on Jesse for this movie (there's good reason for that but if you haven't seen the show, I won't spoil it). Jesse was introduced as the "harder" of the two characters but throughout the show, he was the one who had a conscience and perhaps even more integrity. I think this was a good continuation of what Jesse would do after the escape. None of his decisions were shocking or out of character and I think Vince did a good job of plotting out what Jesse's immediate next moves would be after the Breaking Bad finale. He was the same disillusioned, scared but tough talking punk that he always was and while he doesn't fit the traditional mould of a hero, there is both purpose and some twisted sense of morality to what he does. They were true to the character and they checked that box on the checklist for me.<br/><br/>One of the more common complaints I've heard from fans of the show is that the movie is too slow and takes too long. To be fair, the beginning of El Camino is slow and they could have picked up the pace a little. But I think fans of Breaking Bad are just remembering the highlights of the show as opposed to the entirety of it. Breaking Bad may be one of the best series ever to be on TV but it was never fast paced. They chose to soak the drama and the tension into every scene and it was often SLOW and it was deliberately done that way. Its just how Vince Gilligan and his team operates, this methodical pace carried over into the spin off Better Call Saul and its just something you have to get accustomed to. I was starting to get frustrated with El Camino and then I remembered "Right.... Breaking Bad was always like this." So while you may have to wade through scenes that are important but lack the mile-a-minute thrills, the payoff is good enough and they're just being consistent.<br/><br/>You do have to be patient with El Camino but I think after you get to where Jesse begins to search the apartment, the movie does ramp up and the consequences of what Jesse is doing become clearer. The situation gets more difficult, he's obviously still traumatized by what's happened to him and it becomes a constant struggle of can he do what he needs to do to get out of this situation? You have Aaron Paul slipping back into this role seamlessly and between his performance and Gilligan knowing where to go with the plot, you get what you want out of El Camino. There are scenes where you could cut the tension with a knife and they pull a rabbit out of their hat with a few twists. Stick with El Camino and if you're a fan, they give you what you expect from Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was awesome but I would never say it was perfect and I have similar comments about El Camino. Aaron Paul and the cast are great, the story is fits as both a continuation of the show and works as a movie and it packs both the drama and the tension you got from Breaking Bad. I wasn't in love with it but I respected it and it fits the bill. If you're a fan and not inherently picking, El Camino is definitely worth catching on Netflix. I'm grading it out as an 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10 I just can't understand how so many people rate this movie with such positive reviews when it offers nothing new.<br/><br/>It feels like it was just another slow paced episode that fits right after the last episode.<br/><br/>To me this movie could perfectly be 1 hour long and be just that an epilogue focusing on jesse's life. I was wondering, why this film comes earlier than Better Call Saul final season.
The foreshadowing, the unexpectable stages that Jesse has to walk through to his freedom is working very well here. I know, that not every characters story has closed, but be patient, people! There is must be a reason we got El Camino first now. Watch closely at Jesses' and Eds' talking at the shop.
There are important informations, gems hidden in the whole Breaking Bad universe, so be patient. Wait for the real closure. El Camino was only the beginning of the closure. Seeing a lot of reviews that say this movie added nothing to the series has compelled me to write my own.
Am I the only one who cares about Jesse? He was always the most lovable and relatable character to me (not detracting from the perfection of Walt's character and portrayal). But one complaint I had from the original series was not knowing how Jesse's story ended. This movie answered that in a well thought out and believable manner.
Another complaint I'm seeing is that this movie is boring. I seem to recall being quite bored during some episodes from the show. Any major twists and turns, or heart pounding action would have just felt forced. The reason those were so impactful in the original series was because they took time to draw out. This movie successfully avoided forcing in too much fan service and was loyal to the tone of the series.
All in all, I found this movie genuinely enjoyable even without the stunning action and twists. As a fan, I always hoped Jesse would find a better life, and I really enjoyed seeing him get the happy ending he deserved. Actually Vince did pretty good job on this, it was a great end to show Vince Gilligan took 7 months to write this script, saying the script is bad is just not true, even for people that didn't like the film, Vince wrote the hell out of this thing. Story however will either stick to you like glue, or find you wondering when is it going to pay off, and it may or may not pay off. Jessie has always played his role and this time it's time for him to shine, this is Jessie Pinkmans story folks, so stand by Walter it's time for Jessie to leave your nest. Production was splendid, cinematography was amazing, and the performances throughout the cast and how they fit into the story was very compelling and thought provoking at times. I feel personally this film is a Movie by itself is 8/10 and that's from a critical perspective, but the breaking bad fan in me that knows and has seen it all, it really deserves a 9/10. There's never been a movie turned from tv show to really do it justice, sure there's a lot you can name, but there's 5 times more you can name where it just doesn't go so well. Vince did great with this, the focused story and not trying too hard to click with the entirety that we have seen in breaking bad. He manages to play with our heartstrings with the beautiful cameos that fit with the film and Jessie's remarkable story, they do not feel forced, they help the story a lot. The only flaws I have are as follows, some editing was very off sometimes, for instance Jessie gets tied up and gets a sock stuck in his mouth and then they cut it from another angle and his body isn't the same way and the sock magically comes out, there's others too but it's not distracting from the story or the overall enjoyment, just nit picks, but as far as a huge error in the movie for me, it's the villain, they needed to make him much more villainous for me. The climax also needed to be more epic, Jessie goes in there with no plan, I feel HES in there and gets lucky because someone's a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, it just felt very cheesy, they should have gone a route where he has that trick right, but then he's defenseless because of the people that were there to allow that, and we think it's over for him, but he has a major card up his sleeve, a Big Bang like Walt goes out, but then again, it only makes me love this film more because Jessie isn't Walt, and in a way he still goes out like that fashion. All in all, it's not going to stick with many, 7.8 as of right now on IMDb and I feel a lot of people are bashing this way too much, if you really expected a 10/10 movie ad you're mad you didn't get one, that does not mean the film is a 1/10, these reviews are ridiculous, 5/10 is understandable but there's no way this film is any lower. It has elements that a film has and more, you can't deny it's suspense the script and acting. This is not a 1/10 film. We all knew this wasn't going to touch BB, it doesn't have to either, and that's why it's amazing folks. This movie is like another episode to conclude the serie with a nice epilogue. Great one. I decided ahead of time I would have no expectations of "El Camino" before watching, and I'm happy to say I was very happy with how the final movie came out. Vince Gilligan and producer/star Aaron Paul have made what I think is a perfectly paced, adept sequel to what is probably the greatest TV drama of all time, "Breaking Bad". "El Camino" perfectly captures everything about the "Breaking Bad" show that made it so gritty and amazing to watch, in a film that perfectly completes Jesse Pinkman's character arc.<br/><br/>As you'd expect, there are cameos from many "Breaking Bad" actors but it would still be a huge spoiler to mention who! For a film that is particularly "spoiler sensitive" as is any "Breaking Bad" property (with 62 amazing episodes, plus a spin-off series) I think NO spoilers ought to be given out by anybody that's seen it already!<br/><br/>At 2 hours long the story manages to fill Jesse Pinkman's epilogue with a lot of drama, conflict, and genuinely surprising plot reveals; and it is the equal to many of "Breaking Bad"s better episodes. The only bad thing I have to say about "El Camino" is how genuinely nostalgic it made me feel for the days when I had another truly great "Breaking Bad" episode to watch on TV that night... can it really have been 10 years ago? Well, I was a little bit afraid how this addition to Breaking Bad series will continue. Vince Gilligan hasn't disappointed me, again! It's almost incredible in which details El Camino follow the last season of Breaking Bad - it must be very difficult to get back all the actors, props etc retrospectively back in appearance and behavior. Wow! Hat off to you, Vince! There is no words to describe this movie, except that it gave us real ending for Breaking bad. We waited for ending and we got one, maybe someone wont like it or it will say its boring, or that there is no real action as series. But this was just amazing way to end a story. Todd's flashbacks were too much, and even a bit boring at some point. Walter's appearance was forced and not necessary.<br/><br/>2 hours, considering the movie's events are way too much, could fit perfectly in a 45 mins episode. I enjoyed watching this, it was nice to see what became of Pinkman after the show ended, and this was a good little story. So yeah, not bad all. It was unnecessary. I wish it had a more compelling story. But I still was on board because of the love I have for the characters. Conflicting feelings :(<br/><br/>However, it was satisfying, solid and fair enough A good opportunity to recover the wonderful memories of the best series in history in my opinion as well as the director was wonderful as usual, in short it was the film as I wished. I hated nothing. This was a solid story. Flashbacks told what they needed to. Present day side of the story told what it needed to. Cinematography was amazing as usual. Loved it First of all, this is a movie, not a series, a two hour movie so you're not gonna be expecting much by logic.
Secondly, there's no surpassing perfect. Which is Breaking Bad, and Breaking Bad has ended so well that anything beyond that point would seem inferior.
This is a great movie, its about Jesse and how did he do after being busted out, this is mainly for all of us to make sure that Walter White has died in that final scene.
This movie is all round solid, the action, the directing, even the flashbacks and that Walt and Jesse segment, nothing a true Breaking Bad fan won't appreciate, and of course the great performance by Robert Foster who sadly passed away one day after the premiere of El Camino. This as small as a tribute the fine actor would get. Excellent performance Mr Paul.. 👍🏼👍🏼Just as great as the series.. guy has a knack for getting out of extremely tight situations.... seriously 😳 Simply amazing, a proper ending for Jesse. With al the quality we are used to. If Netflix movies were actually considered for the Oscars, then he may even have gotten the best actor nomination.
It contain as many nail-biting moments as the show used to spread over a full season and gives him something new to be, an hero who is uniquely conflicted, exhausted and in many ways, a broken one. Despite its pace and scale, one of the greatest pleasures of El Camino is that it still makes space for the mixture of thriller and humour we have gotten just like the show.
Breaking Bad, after so many years, show other TV shows how to end a story perfectly, yet again in Style!<br/><br/>Superb Screenplay and Direction by Vince Gilligan! I personally expected even more intensity from the movie but it kept its "Real" nature of Breaking Bad true to its core! Aaron Paul is a natural as usual with his best character on tv!
As for jesse, his performance was immense 100% pinkman from start to finish what a ledgend deffonately Aaron Paul's best performance yet! Carried the torch for breaking bad fans in a big way and didn't disappoint not once !!! Yeeaahh Bittcchh Wow. To all you people who keep giving bad reviews and keep saying that it is 'just a good movie', but not 'special' or 'amazing': the bar was already set to 9/10 by the series, and the movie just kept the same standard, so there was no need for it to try to amaze anyone, as a matter of fact it is just what it was supposed to be - a final closure to a great story perfectly told. Although not as gut wrenching as the breaking bad episodes, this is nonetheless a befitting finale to the best show ever. Lots of nostalgia points and a skinny Pete finally becomes a legend. Worth the watch. Breaking Bad has been among the best TV series of all time.
El camino doesn't feel like a movie but a slow paced episode of Breaking Bad, showing the fate of Jesse Pinkman.
It doesn't disappoint and totally justifies the BB series. Well, my expectations were really high considering i'm a big Breaking Bad fan. I wasn't disappointed, but left a little underwhelmed and unsatisfied wanting more kind of like my wife. I digress...<br/><br/>This is more like a movie for the fans of Breaking Bad. You go in never seeing an episode of Breaking Bad, you're going to be seriously lost and lose attention quickly.<br/><br/>This could've been the last episode of Breaking Bad, just to wrap it all up to be honest. But I guess AMC didn't want to pay to be part of that.<br/><br/>In any case, if you're a Breaking Bad fan, you're going to like it. Love it? That's up to you. Hardcore breaking bad fans may get disappointed with the movie as it doesn't have the brilliance of scenes like the train heist. I genuinely think there is really no comparison between Breaking Bad and El Camino, Breaking Bad is your main course and El Camino is your desert.<br/><br/>With that being said, I will like to applaud Vince Gilligan for not compromising one bit on the character of Jesse Pinkman, he could have made Jesse do different things like turning Jesse into Heisenberg too but Vince was honest and he delivered a great movie with absolute justice to characterizations portrayed in breaking bad.<br/><br/>you get great acting, stunning editing and you do get some goosebumps surprises, you get the closure you wanted and Jesse deserves it. Nice Movie. Incredible acting of Aron Paul, But the appearence of actor Jesse Plemons ( Todd ) was very diferent then last Breaking Bad episode, he was so fat in this Movie that disturbed the Experience. What do people expect? It was a continuation of breaking bad and it served it its purpose.. Good suspense and great ending.. There's only so much you can fit inside 2 hours. I don't understand all the negativity. Thumbs up to a great follow up to one of the best shows to ever grace television Finally we get to know about Jesse's life post breaking bad.
And the writers haven't failed to deliver the standards.
Amazing movie.
Absolutely loved it. Annoying movie, trivial plot, too much action and not so many dialogues, that movie went too far from the breaking bad style, it's sufficient because it gives an end to Jessie's story but that gave to me 0 emotions Screw you Mr. Gilligan... screw you! Why do you do this to me? Never had any movie or tv show have me sitting on the edge of my seat holding my breath like Breaking Bad did... I would definitely call myself a super fan, I've watched BrBa back to front about 6 or 7 times. So I had high expectations of El Camino... and F me you did it to me again!<br/><br/>All kinds of things leaked which made me fantasize about all the things that could happen, then there was the trailer which kinda confirmed parts of what I think it was going to happen... and I could've known, it was not what I expected or wanted, but it was what I needed... it was what Jesse needed. I was kinda expecting a very eventful revenge movie, a completely unchained Jesse trying to fight his way to freedom. But why would I expect anything else from the genius named Vince Gilligan and throw me off completely?<br/><br/>This movie satisfied me, again it had me on the edge of my seat... I actually had to pause 3 times to take a breather. I had to rewrite my review a couple of times because I do not want to disclose any details, don't want to spoil it for anyone. Thank you for not making the movie I expected and staying completely true to who Jesse actually was in BrBa and not turning him into a mindless killer out for revenge... thank you. Again, not what I thought I wanted and/or expected, but exactly what I needed.<br/><br/>(But btw... there needs to be a second movie: Escape from the motel room - A Huell story :D ) You can smell the aftermath of the show. Well written. Can be the best way to continue a great and impressive story. After the series of breaking bad and the successful ending, this movie was needed. Everyone of the Series got his deserved ending except Jesse. Now he got the ending he deserves. This Movie is a must watch for every breaking bad fan I was expecting more from this movie. As much of a phenomenon as Breaking Bad was, this did not for me trump the series. I think the fans wanted closure on Jesse Pinkman and I think they did it the best way they knew how. However, if you are looking for a lot of action and suspense you are not going to get that. Incredible ! Loved every second of it!
Jesse Pinkman is back, and we can finally SEE things from HIS pirspective! When you measure anything against the masterpiece that is Breaking Bad, it's probably going to fall short. So maybe it's not fair to ding a few stars because this movie doesn't quite live up to the TV show it's based upon, but I feel like that's what has to be done.<br/><br/>El Camino is essentially a long epilogue to Breaking Bad that allows us to focus on Jesse instead of Walt. It's like a good long 2-hour episode, but it's no Ozymandius, Crawl Space, Felina or other top tier BB episode. Lots of fan service and cameos, including a flashback scene between Jesse and Walt that in typical style starts off mundane but ends hilariously. There are a number of flashback scenes - where suspension of disbelief is somewhat ruined because an overweight and wrinkled Todd makes it obvious we're not in the past - but they don't add much to what we already knew.<br/><br/>What's really missing is the emotional dialogue and depth that made Breaking Bad great. We never hear from Jesse how he felt about Walt's betrayal or his time in captivity. Instead the movie is concerned with moving him forward. The only scene I thought was ridiculous was a shoot out where Jesse and his opponent fire worse than Stormtroopers, repeatedly missing each other while standing a few feet apart out in the open. When did Jesse become a gun slinger anyway?<br/><br/>Other than that, this was a good, not great, addition to the Breaking Bad franchise. It does not betray what is one of the best endings in TV history, but adds a nice little epilogue to let us know Jesse is gonna be ok (although now I guess we'll have to wait to find out what happened to Skinny Pete!). The film is ok, story is good and ties things up nicely, but its all a little not breaking bad and just a Jessy story, its ok just not amazing was expecting a lot better. This is the perfect homage to the Jesse Pinkman plot and Vince Gilligan has got this absolutely spot on. Aaron Paul is as mesmerising as Jesse Pinkman as he was always. The cinematography looks exceptional too. There are a few surprises which goes very well with the story. Must watch if you're a breaking bad fan. A great ending to the Best thing that has ever happened to television. The film picks up right where Breaking Bad left off. Truly the conclusion Jesse Pinkman deserved. Aaron Paul is phenomenal and the cinematography is gorgeous. Just an absolutely beautiful swan song to one of the most iconic characters in television history. Some will complain that the plot was thin or that not much happened, but this movie showed you everything you needed to know about Jesse Pinkman and his tremendous arc, it's the movie he would've wanted, and thankfully it's the movie we got. I recommend to watch the last season of Breaking bad Let's be honest everyone, this is not a 10 movie. I'm a hardcore Breaking Bad fanatic. Don't believe me, check my ratings.<br/><br/>This movie felt like a bunch of deleted scenes and intro scenes combined to try and make a movie. Like one reviewer said, Fat Todd, I couldn't get over it. Then we have a clean Badger and a Skinny Pete with a plan.<br/><br/>They were better off leaving their faiths unknown. Total tripe. No storyline and vage. A money spinoff from the TV series and it failed much like the Breaking Bad movie and TV series about their lawyer. Let the series rest in peace. Boring and empty slow story. This shouldn't be related to the legendary Breaking Bad series You guys must be kidding me this movie was terrible with all the possibilities that could've been done this is what Netflix produces how is it that Todd games 40 pounds and that's acceptable . what did They pay him for this role he could even get into character and drop weight. I guess we will just except anything these days. Jessie was awesome as usual he deserved a lot better than this. Vince should be ashamed of himself. Dont expect any thrills though it dose have a Tarantino feel bout it and worth a watch but don't make it part of your big night in Vince Gillian once said in an interview that one of his favorite films was butch cassidy and the sundance kid. His love of westerns really shows in this film, and not in a good way.
One of the best things about the show breaking bad is that every plot twist and turn felt natural and it never seemed like the writers were making the characters fit the story. Instead, it always felt like the story flowed naturally from the characters' actions and decisions. With El Camino it's really obvious that Vince Gillian desperately wanted a western shoot out at the end. He kind of bent the characters to his will.
Why would a small time owner of a welding company risk his life by instigating a western shootout with a guy he has no beef with, for a meesly $1,800 after scoring the biggest break of his life? Because cocaine? There's no amount of rationalitization that could get me to believe that's anything more than cheap writing.<br/><br/>Also seeing Heisenberg in a bald cap was like a spit in the face. One of the most boring movies I have watched recently. 4/10. I don't know its a movie or 1 more episode,, & a very bad episode.
No script
No story
Bad acting<br/><br/>Totally waste of time, & Name of "Breaking Bad" A beautiful mix of past flashbacks and present objectives. This movie exactly picks off where it left and guides the viewer through a slow yet enticing end of undoubtedly one of the best fictional characters of all time. Lots of nostalgia and great writing really delivers that Breaking Bad level satisfaction.
A must watch for a breaking bad fan. Super cheap movie, made with only a few actors. A terrible disappointed This is worst movie i've ever seen No story nothing you can see in this movie Didn't miss Cranston at all. Aaron Paul always had much more range and he shines in this. While I was still wondering why this was made, or how can Vince Gilligan's art's quality drop so low, or why I just spent two hours watching what should have been a measly two episodes of the original cult classic TV show, El Camino (name of a vintage Chevrolet car) came in and went without making a bang or ruffling a few feathers, something that I was expecting it to do. TN. I waited months for THAT ending. 0/10 on rotten tomatoes. I was extremely disappointed watching this, I didn't have really high standards coming into this but I nowhere predicted it to be this bad. Felt forced, acting was subpar at best and all the flashbacks gave me a headache! Jessie was imprisoned but very fat. There is no reality. Out of respect for the viewers they could have at least starved Jesse and Todd before filming. Aaron isn't fat, but his face is way too round compared to the last BB scenes. That is what makeup for. His haircut is also too fancy, though filthy, for someone who spent months in a cage. After just one night sleep, cup of noodles, shower and shaving emaciated, mentally and physically broken Jesse looks like a normal happy go lucky guy, minus face cringe. Aaron couldn't replicate BB Jesse. His eyes clearly indicate he is acting, not living his role.
Everything else in this movie is a load of crap. Taking the viewers for fools isn't cool at all. What a waste of money and talent and our time. Why they have created such a crap. I don't really understand this. It's in no way cinematic and in no way stand-alone and just plays like a very slow feature length episode of the show all for some minor tie up of what happens to Jesse which could have been left open anyway. The film itself felt more like a parodie of the show, the characters were really not as they where in the series and fat todd was the cherry on top off everything The best thing about it is..
It's just another episode. .
The finale episode for the series was Walts.
This is nothing more than Jessys finale episode.. and it's absolutely perfect. Doesn't feel like a movie at all. And it's perfect. And if anyone deserves a happy ending ... it's Jesse Pinkman. Beautiful, touching continuation of the most fantastic series ever to grace the screen. Yes, I cried at the end. Felt as if I'd just spent a couple hours with several good, old friends. I knew Vince would do it right! <3 While it was nice to see Jessie pinkman once more on screen this movie was completely unnecessary and didn't really add anything special to the franchise. It didn't really answer any unanswered questions. I had hoped this movie show Jessie getting away and starting a new life and becoming a changed man. Again, great writing from Vince Gilligan that tied up a whole bunch of lunch ends from the show. They did such a good job tying up all the loose ends in the series that there's nothing left for Jesse to do but take care of himself. They had to tack on a new character to act as an antagonist when not flashing back to when Tod was still alive. It's just Jesse and brief cameos of a handful of side characters. After the GREAT BREAKING BAD this is an end story?they think we are fool?an ending only for money?Jesus Christ.Show some respect to us...nice marketing tool..,, I was bored throughout this film. Don't waste 2 hours of your time. There was no need to make this movie and ruin all the excellent products that were being shown, talking about Vince Gillian. Todd with 50 kilos of more, WW with a notorious false head, Jesse's friends with strange attitudes to the plot. And the worst, boring, too boring. Characters only appear for nostalgia. Unintelligible. I looked forward to this movie ever since the first teaser dropped. I am really sad to say this, but the only feeling I got when the credits started rolling was one of overwhelming disappointment.<br/><br/>They could've done so much with the Jessy character. Have some trauma-induced flashback, see him struggle with himself and his demons, come to terms with who he is.
The movie just tasted bland. No salt, no pepper. No basic Breaking Bad ingredients.
Just utterly disappointing and meaningless. It ends the same way as the series ended. Jessy driving away, leaving his further endeavors as open as the series did.<br/><br/>To end on a postivite note :
The acting of Aaron Paul is superb, really good. He embodies the character amazingly, but could've done more given the right script. The scenes were beautifully shot and some fanservice in flashbacks. I waited for this to happen! there is nothing compare to this movie!! What a waste of two hours. This film not short by any stretch of the imagination contains no jeopardy no tension and so little drama that you'd have to ask why?<br/><br/>Put simply this film meandered from the first minute and delivered nothing of the powerfully emotive and painfully tense drama of the series. In so doing it's a waste of time for anyone either wanting to extend their enjoyment of the epic series or engage for the first time. In fact if you've not seen BB - DO NOT START HERE!!!<br/><br/>Nothing to see - move along...<br/><br/>Tragic One of the most silly movie don't know why it has a good rating it was an irritating waste of time It was like a movie similar to some of the slower episodes. Not sure I cared for chubby Jessie Pinkman lol. If I was keot captive in a hole I don't think I'd gain weight. Was interesting but I'll never watch it again If you watched Breaking Bad, you will enjoy 2 more (mediocre) episodes. I'm pretty sure that people who didn't watch BB will not enjoy this movie. There was so much expectation from this movie after breaking bad but this movie is total disappointment for me. Like many sequels and "based on" movies this one does not change the law.<br/><br/>There is no story to tell. Rather yet another episode in the life of never-ending loser Jesse.<br/><br/>Jesse manages to get out of his captivity and decides to follow the advice of one of his buddies from many years ago: to run away and start a new life in a land far away, i.e. Alaska. So Jesse embarks on the long journey committing two-three more murders along the way, stealing somebody else's, already stolen money, stealing his parents' property and potentially exposing them as participants in one of his murders by using one of their hand guns before he ends up in Alsaka wearing snow white pullover, presumably symbolizing clean new start, on the background of majestic snow white Alaskan forest.<br/><br/>The best play there was in my view by Skinny.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with Aaron Paul as an actor, the whole movie was poorly conceived.<br/><br/>The biggest regret, - wasted two hours of my life on this.<br/><br/>So, I give it two stars, - one to Skinny, one to Jesse Well that was a thing. Respect for capping off another part of the story. I didn't think it was all that interesting. A few good scenes but I don't remember being wow'd by any cinematography like with shots in BB. Some people are saying that this movie is unnecessary and Vince should leave show as it was. But in Breaking Bad we saw the end of Walter's story, but Jesse's story was kinda incomplete. It was necessary to show the audience what happened afterwards. This shall put a full stop on Breaking Bad franchise. Breaking Bad was the best TV show of all time. This was an unnecessary prologue. It's very slow and adds nothing to the story. Could have done a much better movie.
Pure Boredom
Waste of money in my opinion Actually, this movie only for true Breaking Bad fans. If you're not a huge Breaking Bad fan, you cannot judge this one. I was sceptical about this, loved BB and rewatched the series earlier this year so it was fresh in my mind. I wondered if this would ruin but it far exceeded my expectations and I feel like it flowed naturally as if filmed straight after the original series ended. Great to see some of the original cast pop up, would of been nice to maybe see a couple of others but on the whole I feel this gave Jesse the ending he deserved and an opportunity to make his own way in the world away from Walter Whites shadow. A must for BB fans it won't disappoint. Tough, gritty. A bit violent. A cracking film, if you liked BB this is a must see. I wish focus on pinkman more and i watch a lot of different on guys between bast ans future El camino was a good movie but there is no relationship between el camino and breaking bad Very disappointed. Did Vince write this story in 6 months? A movie about 1,5 day after Jessy escaped the cage. ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Breaking Bad might as well be one of the most if not the most important TV art that was ever made; It's on the farthest end of the spectrum of character studies and dynamics along with impeccable dissection of philosophical and emotional intricacy. Its themes had cast an endless shadow on many motion pictures and social thought processes since its premiere in 2008 and will continue to do so for a long time. I can go on and on, and that's why it's a dangerous and a very much doubted act to touch such completeness again with another picture. I was weary about El Camino as a project, yet, Gilligan proved to me again, that I am wrong, and we indeed needed a little bit more. What makes Gilligan a genius is that he can see through the barriers of insecurities, he did that with Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, and each one of us, and he was and still quite frankly ... right!<br/><br/>El Camino continues right after Breaking Bad's marvelous Felina, it follows Jesse for a few days after his escape from captivity of Uncle Jack's ruthless gang and their haunting demon, Todd. Jesse now is broken and alone, screaming with the sorrow and joy during the momentary glimpse of freedom after breaking the cage, the metaphorical one with his "do it yourself" to his manipulative master, and from the literal bars that destroyed what little remained of his life. But the reality, as it does very often and without mercy, quickly slaps him in the face; he is still on the run, far from freedom, and far from the enchanting hope of any form of salvation.<br/><br/>Throughout this beautiful picture, Jesse relives memories of those who had shaped his destiny; Mike reminded him that the "fresh start" is an achievable goal but not to be mixed with the impossibility of "making it right". Jesse's recollections started with Mike because Mike was maybe the only "father" that Jesse ever had. Mike was compassionate, understanding, protective, non-judgmental, and ultimately wise. Jesse's mental journeys stumble then with the haunting darkness of his abductor, Todd, shedding a light on his long imprisonment, something that breaking bad didn't portray as the arc was mainly of White's. Those memories were as creepy and hopeless as his journey at the moment. Later, when his path had gotten paved, he jumps into a rare intimate moment with his master, Walter White himself, and the scene leaves you in absolute awe. It follows the duo's several days' methamphetamine cook marathon after they had just escaped a lonely and a rather ironic death from famine and thirst in the dessert. Choosing this special moment is their relationship is fitting because characters tend to connect and show some truthfulness after such surreal escape from death. Walter starts by asking Jesse about how soon can he sell the meth, then quickly to show the deep affection that he has for Jesse (or maybe for his perception of a younger self image) when he suggests that Jesse can indeed pursue further levels of education. And then, another "I did it for me" fact emerges, with a naked true fact about what Heisenberg truly is in "I don't have a larger point", to finally ending by stating a core fact that motived much of Heisenberg's acts, when he envied Jesse's youthfulness and the richness of his opportunities in life.<br/><br/>El Camino shows a lonely journey full of hardships and explores them as weird and cold as Albuquerque has been to Jesse, but also shows his sheer resilience that defeated the evil of his past, awarding him with a a shrine of accomplishment by demolishing those who captivated him. Throughout the violence that engulfed Jesse's path, El Camino also doesn't fail in affirming Jesse's kindness, innocence, hope, and his delicate humanity. And this odyssey finally ends with Jesse's fist steps into a new life with a warm portrayal of the last chosen memory of his past; a breath of love from Jane with a beautiful reminder of refusing to surrender to the turbulences of the universe but rather to face them and to "make those decisions yourself".<br/><br/>El Camino is simple and spontaneous, yet daring and true. It plays with what reality would be but dances with the freedom of memory and its influential implications on Jesse's choices, enriching this unforgettable character with a fitting end to his arch, and rewarding us with few poignant glimpses of Breaking Bad's monumental journey, leaving you with smile, satisfaction, and an endless appreciation to its creators.<br/><br/>To El Camino's farewell, I say, Thank you, Gilligan; Thank you, Paul; Thank you, Cranston. You had gifted me with art and meaning that will forever live in my heart, thank you. Yes,TODD was huge and that was distracting. But everything else was perfect. It ending the way we needed. It's just basically 2 extra shows I'm glad that we had something to watch after the series, but it was nothing new and nothing really worth watching. For a lazy Sunday ok, but would i watch it again (like BB), definitely not. Breaking bad was the best tv show I've ever seen and I'm happy to see Jesse Pinkman back on my tv. There was a story to be told after the final BB episode regarding Jesse and in My opinion Vince Gillian has written that story beautifully.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a bang and hits you like a train - There are some nice call backs to the BB universe and some cameo appearances from much loved characters. A brilliant performance from Aaron Paul and after watching this you will be satisfied as this feels like the end of the breaking bad world, all ends now feel tied up. I really enjoyed this movie as it was a good ending to a really good character.<br/><br/>It's just like a breaking bad episode, except longer.
Breaking bad was not all action and sfx. It was about people struggling and this movie keeps this and shows Pinkmans final struggle This movie is only about jesse pinkman, Don't expect to see an action movie,NO, This is A Breaking Bad movie only for the people who saw breaking bad, and this movie was awesome, I really love it Vince has concluded saga with the most appropriate end. It's a treat to watch the legendary characters once again. Can't feel the gap of six years from the last episode. (Ignore fat Todd, he must had junk foods and instant mix soups during that time ðŸ¤£) This is a brilliant way, to end the series once and for all.
We know that Jesse is starting off fresh in Alaska, where he now has a completely new ID and name, and he most certaintly is okay.
Perfect. 2 hours of pure magic is the only words I can use to describe this masterpiece. When it starts it just grabs your attention, pulls you deeper and deeper and doesn't let go till the last minute.<br/><br/>It's the story the breaking bad fans needed and Vince Gilligan stepped up and delivered what they deserved after all these years.
Overall the movie is filled with a lot of unpredictable, suspenseful moments, action, bad guys, flashbacks which help to make more sense to the present and how it all ties in together. It's an approach which I really didn't expect and it surprised me but I love it that they took this route for the movie. To me, this was the right way.<br/><br/>Overall you can expect the breaking bad vibe with its amazing writing, cinematography, sound, set design and everything you would expect from the best. It's the complete package and finally a conclusion to everything.<br/><br/>Overall I think most people will enjoy it and probably a very few won't. Because of course, you can't please everyone, ever. Personally, after watching it this feels like a masterpiece and to me, it's the full package which deserves 10 out of 10.
Would recommend to anyone familiar or not with breaking bad. There are some shows you wish you have never watched so that you could just watch them again fresh from scratch....Breaking Bad is clearly on the very top of that List....this final goodbye just feels like the real thing...are those tears in your eyes? oh man no, no, I just got something in my eye....it's nothing man....it's ok I guess if it's ok to cry over some show, then it's breaking bad What feels so special about this movie is how easy it gets right back into the Breaking Bad universe. It doesn't act like six years have gone since the show as ended. The story is solid and feels like a proper aftermath as well as a great conclusion to Jesse. While I was skeptical on whether they should have kept the original ending of the show as the finale, this confirms that for any fan of Breaking Bad, it is a must watch. Great work by the whole team. Not bad but not neccesary, As a fan of the series i don't get any feeling watching this movie El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie
Thriller. Drama. Dark.
2019.<br/><br/>Yet another masterpiece by the master, Vince Gilligan, meeting and in fact, exceeding every expectations I had.
Acting: 10/10. Hats off, Aaron Paul
Cinematography: 10/10 Just Vince things
Storytelling: 10/10 Unparalleled<br/><br/>Meticulous, slowly-paced, intelligent design directed with a scalpel. Each frame is significant, contributing to every other frame, owing it's existence to the final showpiece. This movie essentially pulled every weak Breaking Bad heartstrings I had. Finally a closure. Bows and scrapes This film was the perfect ending to Jessie's story. The same way breaking bads finale was the perfect ending to Walts story.<br/><br/>Good luck Mr. Driscol! Everything's perfect I repeat everything's perfect A beautiful ode to to brilliant character. The arc is excellent. The acting suberb. And the story is classic. This was the perfect ending to the story of Jesse Pinkman, and he got the ending that, after all he'd been through, he deserved. I haven't watched the series, although I have read about since it gets a lot of hype on media. As for the movie, it was okay. Slow on some spots, but it focuses more on character and story development.<br/><br/>I guess if the series was like this and you liked it, then you will like this movie more than I did. It certainly is good and interesting enough to watch, but not earth-shatteringly good or absolutely great for me. Loved the series but this movie was just boring as hell. Nothing special. I didn't need all this as I felt we left Breaking Bad in a good place but I watched it and it was fine. Aaron Paul showed the damage well, but generally I kept getting distracted by Jesse suddenly being blatantly older and pretty podgy which just jarred massively! I'm sure that if there wasn't budget to do the whole Marvel de-aging and skinnying thing (totally would never get that!), there probably was budget to get a trainer and dietitian in for Aaron Paul. Jesse had just been enslaved... That, alongside all the flashbacks, meant it would have been good to skinny him down for greater authenticity and that might have made him look younger too.
And, yes, I do feel a little bad typing all this and would have held back if it weren't for the fact that actresses have had to be drilled like this since the dawn of the motion picture. They wouldn't have even considered including Krysten Ritter in this if she'd plumped up, so yeah, I'm calling it. Sorry Aaron! What a waste of 2 hours. Start to finish was poor. A waste of a movie This movie shows why Bryan Cranston was the star of the series. It just falls flat without him. He captured each episode with his phenomenal acting... None of that here.. just a bunch of mediocre people with some neat camera angles here and there...I was never sure if Cranston made the show great or Gilligan was just a GOAT. It's clear he needs a talent like Bryan. I'm going to pretend I didint watch the movie and stick with breaking bad had the greatest ending of all time with what we got in the show. Is it only me, but although only a day has passed since Walter White's demise and Jesse's 'escape' on film, the real six years that have passed was pretty obvious on all of them - especially Todd (Jesse Plemons) who had a sizable role in this sequel. This wasn't at all what I was expecting. The trailers show Skinny Pete swearing to the cops that he doesn't know where Jesse Pinkman is, but that wasn't in the movie. I was expecting the sequel to be set a few years down the track, with Jesse facing old demons from the past catching up/chasing him down in his new life. I was not expecting this to be a direct follow-on from where we signed off, interspersed with flashbacks of what went down between Todd and Jesse while Jesse was held captive by the white supremists. I found it to be a slow burn. The acting was fine. I enjoyed it but I was expecting to be on the edge of my seat and I wasn't. Okay there was a storyline. But they spend 2 hours on what felt like deleted scenes. It was slow and uninteresting and made me wonder "why did I watch that all the way through?".<br/><br/>The cinematics are great, acting is okay, the story was awful. I feel like this was solely a cash grab and those that felt nostalgia can't see past the awful story. When the movie ended, it felt like I watched an intro to something bigger. No action, no suspense, fat actors and appeal to nostalgia. The movie is basically jessie getting money and going away. WOW MASTERPIECE! This disappointing sequel is a sad attempt to drag together the frayed ends of the story of Jesse.
It does little more than leave the viewer with a profound sense of ennui. The whole shebang could have easily been condensed into the last episode or added to make an extended final episode. The basic premise is that the audience were left "hungry for more" at the end of the series, allowing the last few drops of milk to be wrung from this cash cow by means of a final closure..The sad part is, that by the end of this miserable codicil..
I had ceased to care. Playing on the success of Breaking Bad, the nostalgia for great TV and perhaps because of pressure from Netflix, Vince Gilligan takes us on a pointless journey that offers nothing new to the viewers in the Breaking Bad sequel: El Camino.
The movie starts with what seems to be a flashback between Mike Ehrmantraunt and Jessie Pinkman where Jessie talks about starting fresh and making things right. These two wishes are just the whole point of Jessie's journey in El Camino.
We follow Jessie trying to escape from the police, realizing he needs money to change his identity and start over. Along the way we see flashbacks of him with Todd the psychopath, getting dragged into a fight that he didn't want just to get enough cash to pay Ed the vacuum cleaner guy. At the end of the movie Jessie starts remembering a conversation he had with Walter White and Jane. Jessie realizes he can't make things right for those two, yet he sends a letter to Brock (Andrea's son) to say goodbye and perhaps explain his role in his mother's death.
I didn't feel I was watching Jessie Pinkman, but Aaron Paul playing Jessie. His age and weight are definitely different from six years ago which ruined the illusion for me. It was fun though watching some of the old cast again like Skinny Pete, Badger and Walter White.
F.Scott Fitzgerald says" You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say". Which makes me wonder why did Vince Gilligan write the movie? El Camino had nothing to say but what exactly did it want to say? Mabye not the car lol, but a damn well needed follow-up movie to the one of the best shows Breaking Bad and especially one of the main characters Jesse. The fact they started exactly where Jesse left off giving you his story and aftermath fans will appreciate El Camino. OH, comparison of Todd's weight...Priceless This movie was a farewell to Jesse Pinkman. Something he deserved but wasn't given in Breaking bad.<br/><br/>Jess had faced the worst luck of life. If Walter White was the Face of Breaking Bad, Jesse was its soul. He added the emotions to the series, the essence of life with its ups and downs, major losses and happiness in small things.<br/><br/>The last few episodes of Breaking Bad were focused more on Walt than on Jesse. And seeing Jess as a slave in those episodes broke my heart. The guy who had helped Walt and been at his side through it all, was alone and a slave. Walt did his part in the last episode of the TV Show called 'Felina'. It was a tribute to Walt, showing his human side. And we saw Jesse free, finally, what he deserved!<br/><br/>But what next? Of course we all know he would make a dash for it, get a new identity, move to a different city or country. It's what any of us would have done. And so did Jesse. And that's what the movie is about if it picked off from where the TV Show left off, which it did. So there's nothing new I expected from the storyline. But still the writer's did a great job of conveying this small timeline and including Jesse's mates and how they help him, his PTSD and flashbacks, how he gets the money or losses it and gets it again, and finally gets what he wanted.<br/><br/>Everything is this movie is purely Breaking Bad. The scenes, the locations, the characters, the acting. It's a complete nostalgia and in fact more like 2 episodes of Breaking Bad rather a movie.<br/><br/>Special Credit goes to the cinematography and the locations used on the movie. The beautiful deserts with their small hills during the flashback scene where Todd takes Jesse to bury the body of his maid or the Scene of Jesse searching through Todd's apartment as he bangs the walls, and the top view showing multiple Jesse's rummaging through the entire apartment or the scene where Todd is driving Jesse to the desert and singing along the radio and waving his hand in the side view mirror as he cruises along, all were very beautifully and creatively shot scenes and which gives this movie its own flavor away from Breaking Bad too. Something that is just this movie and you'd crave it for those scenes and moments.<br/><br/>This movie, besides showing the onward journey of Jesse, also shows some more glimpses of Todd. Honestly, I had even forgotten who Todd was when this movie came out since it had been so long since I finished Breaking Bad, and his role in the series was a little muffled. There were so many more overpowering characters in the show that his role can be easily forgotten. So seeing his character more, learning more about him and his dealing with Jesse, made up for the lack of focus on Jesse that Breaking Bad had down towards its season finale as well as brought Todd more in the highlight.<br/><br/>Jesse's PTSD was depicted very real, and at every moment, I was able to connect with him. Even at the point when he gave up his gun to the pretend cops in Todd's apartment, I felt for Jesse, as they showed his flashback scene where he returned the gun to Todd in the desert. The guy had accepted his fate. It also showed that Jesse was good at heart, he always was.<br/><br/>The show's name, Breaking Bad comes from the fact that Walt, what the society would call a 'Good' Person, goes on the path to becoming what according to the society calls 'Bad' Person. But what the show truly explores is a person's own judgement for when he considers himself that he has actually become 'bad'. Because everyone has their own self justification, it takes a while before we realize that we are wrong or doing something bad. For Walt, he realized this in the last episode when he went to save Jesse. That he had finally broken Bad. He was the worst of 'em all now and he was trying to fix it for Jesse.
While Jesse was the opposite. Jesse was introduced as a Bad guy. He was already cooking meth, caught by cops, dealing with some drug dealers, etc. etc. And he reformed over the course of the show to become good. What this movie finally explores and shows is Breaking Good. Jesse finally free, can take all the revenge he needs to, but still he does things by the rules, he forgives and lets things go and he trusts people and has belief in humanity. When he finally does get his freedom, and he is driving off imagining Jane by his side, you are cheerful, you feel for him, you know he deserves it, and you say to yourself, "Jesse Pinkman, you're a good man."<br/><br/>
How It Impacted Me<br/><br/>If Jesse Pinkman, who truly deserves it, doesn't go for revenge and forgives people, and can let things go, so can you. Jesse surrender to the universe in this show. In every form and way. And he won. That is the one true and great message of this movie. Surrender to the universe. Ironically, they even show that in the scene where Jane and Jesse are talking and Jesse believes in going where the universe takes you while Jane debunks it. But Jesse still has his faith in this even after all that he went through, and that is the lesson of this show. To not lose your faith in the universe's plan for you even in the hard times. This movie is ok but show is very amazing and unique i am only watch for only show remain story for Jesse This movie tells us what happened to Jesse Pinkman after he escaped from Jack's gang. Now if you're expecting that he'd be dealing with the DEA or some big trouble in this film like Breaking Bad, that's not to case here. He only deals with two random guys who arean't that special. At the end he simply kills them, takes their money, gives it to "the disappearer" and gets a fresh start to his life. Well it's not bad and pretty happy ending too. But there isn't enough tension and suspense in this like Breaking Bad. In my opinion, he should've been atleast having trouble with cops or maybe in getting disappeared. They also didn't told us what happened to Skinny Pete who took care of the car Jesse bought from Jack's place (he probably went into police custody). I have to say it might be a disappointment because audience expected a bit more because of "A breaking bad movie" title associated with it. You still gotta watch it though if you've watched Breaking Bad. So don't overthink. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not boring or bad by any means but less than expectations. Love the ending of this movie as I loved the ending of the Shawshank' Redemption. Reborn. Farewell Jessie. Live a pure life which White didn't have a chance to live. You earned it. I really admire Vince Gilligan's TV work but unfortunately, his winning formula doesn't work in a movie format. The original series was simply about Walter White going bad and Jesse Pinkman being better through a subtle and time-consuming process. In this movie, probably in order to create tension and stretch the playtime, Jesse negates all his 6-season long character development for a few dollars more.<br/><br/>While it has some nice bits and it's exciting to see some of the beloved characters once more, El Camino still feels like an unnecessarily extended version of a bonus episode. If it were placed in the DVD set of the Breaking Bad as a 40-minute long goodbye, that would have been a better gesture for the fans. By doing so, Jesse might not have done something out of character.<br/><br/>For a person who hasn't watched a single episode of the Breaking Bad, if such a person exists LOL, it's just another slice-of-life crime drama. In my opinion, nostalgia and respect to the original material are not enough to elevate this decent movie to a higher status. There was absolutely no need for this film at all in my opinion. If we really needed to know what happened to Jesse Pinkman while we were watching the other characters then why could that be written into one or two more episodes of the final season?!! A waste of time to write and film and watch this many years later. Jesse Pinkman wasn't an interesting character anyway. He was predictable. Breaking Bad is arguably one of, if not the greatest television series of all time. It started relatively small but gained momentum until it became the stand out for premier television. It could even be argued that Breaking Bad is the series that ushered in what many are calling the Golden age of television that we are currently in (We would like to argue that this Golden age of TV ended this year as well, but that's a discussion for another time). It's been SIX YEARS since Breaking Bad officially ended in 2013 and we've just gotten the follow up movie released on Netflix and maybe in select theaters? (we didn't check). Does the movie hold up though? Well read the ramblings of a mostly intoxicated individual and find out!<br/><br/>A little bit of history into my personal experience with Breaking Bad, I was a later adopter to streaming, not fully diving into the medium until atleast 2013, I wont pretend to know the exact date... but Breaking Bad was the FIRST series I binge watched. Which means for those who are paying attention (It's been like maybe 3 sentences you should be able to pay attention that long) I got into Breaking Bad just as it was ending. I was more or less able to breeze through the entire series, and I did again when I introduced my future spouse to the series a few years later, so I am more than familiar with the source material. So I wont pretend like I know the anxious feeling of what was going to happen next week, and having to wait anxiously for whats going to happen next, because as far as this series goes that was a non factor for me.<br/><br/>PLOT : A- (92/100)<br/><br/>El Camino picks up literally right where Breaking Bad ends, with Jesse Pinkman running away from a white supremacist drug compound leaving a trail of bodies behind (spoilers for a series that ended SIX years ago). The movie follows Jesse as he evade the police and tries to find a new path for himself.<br/><br/>El Camino is the perfect example of a simple plot done well. Never once did the story become convoluted or confusing, Jesse want's to escape from the proverbial man. The only real turn is that he has to get money to do so, because we live in a capitalist society and that's how that works. There is plenty of fan service that makes sense for the lore established, but should also make sense for anybody jumping into the movie without any prior Breaking Bad Experience. (is there anybody who just watched the movie without seeing the series first? we would genuinely love to talk to you).<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES: A (96/100)<br/><br/>Gosh darnit we want to give this a perfect score but it feels like Jesse's PTSD was brought up in a wonderful way, but then dropped halfway through out of nowhere. We don't know if thats more of a plot or a performance issue but we are putting it here. There is only one real performance of not to bring up, all the other characters are serviceable but guys, this movie is about...<br/><br/>Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman. There might not be a performance we closer associate with a particular actor in the last... 10 years? Like we said earlier the moments where the character is experiencing PTSD might be some of the most heartbreaking moments we can recall in recent memory, including having just watched 2019's JOKER. But also, that part of the character is dropped after the first act of the movie, he shaves his head and his PTSD is gone? Admittedly I do not have PTSD but I don't think that's how it works.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: A- (92/100)<br/><br/>This is always a hard category for us to grade as it is the most subtle. El Camino's cinematography does exactly what it needs to, to me anyway. It doesn't do any crazy camera tricks or angles, it just frames every character perfectly with the right amount of lighting.<br/><br/>BONUS POINTS: -5 points because frick Todd<br/><br/>I JUST HATE TODD SO MUCH<br/><br/>Final Grade: A- (92/100 or 275/300)<br/><br/>El Camino the best contemporary western since 2007s No Country For Old Men, without question. I didn't even realize it was a western until the last act but reread the plot and notice that it makes for a perfect movie with cowboys and horses and banditos. The entire movie is perfectly anchored by Aaron Paul's nuanced performance, even if some plot threads are dropped earlier than they should be.<br/><br/>El Camino is currently available for streaming on NETFLIX<br/><br/>Written by: KC James<br/><br/>Please remember that film, television, and all art is subjective. We do not expect everybody to have the same opinions as we do and please be respectful, to our writers and the creators of the reviewed product. El Camino may have lacked the spark of Breaking Bad, but it was the perfect ending to Jesse's story and his desire for closure. The finale we wanted comprising jesse pinkman is this so satisfying thank you for breaking bad!! So I won't overdo this. Nothing much happens, bunch of slow paced flashbacks etc. It's like a very slow episode of Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul stretched out in to a 2-hour 'movie'. They should have made it a 'special' and tagged it on to the end of Breaking Bad as a holiday special type of thing rather than calling it a movie which sets expectations differently.<br/><br/>To be honest I was never a fan of Pinkman, such a weak and boring character. I loved Breaking Bad and Saul is good too, but I wouldn't have bothered watching this if my wife hadn't insisted that we had to watch it 'before someone at work spoils it' for her.<br/><br/>Yawn. Heisenberg was in this movie for half minutes.. and no saul goodman.. what complete bs.. i cant say this was breaking bad movie therefore.. Breaking Bad was awesome - that is the general concensus. Was this movie needed? Absolutely not.
Not only was it such a long time after Bb concluded on our TVs and most of us had forgotten what exactly happened and who was still breathing. This was just a lot of Jesse looking about with tears in his eyes and people appearing making us think what did they do again and who the hell are they?!
Aaron Paul is a decent actor and this review isn't a slate on him I just don't think this movie was necessary. Breaking Bad ending doesn't give a proper ending to Pinkman. This movie is as typical, intriguing and breath-taking as Breaking Bad.
The main focus of the movie is Pinkman, therefore no other character has given any more than required attention.
In the end, I want to thank Netflix for this gift. Just ok. Wasn't thrilled with the whole thing although I always love Aaron Paul. Also good to see the cameos of all our favorite characters in flashbacks. But sorry, it just wasn't that great storywise. Better Call Saul does it much better although with a series you get much more time to do it indepth. Let me start off by saying that Breaking Bad is my favorite television series of all time. The perfectly threaded, beautifully twisted masterpiece of art that is Breaking Bad is the closest thing to perfect that a television series has ever gotten. The acting, the writing, the directing- everything that made that show is levels above any other show in my opinion, and it was worked on and perfected until they got a worthy product- a product that revolutionized television and created a legacy in pop culture that only few works of art can maintain. This movie however comes nowhere near the level of the show, and it doesn't stand well as a movie in general either. When I heard that there was going to be a Breaking Bad movie I was mostly skeptical. Admittedly I was also full of excitement to see Jesse's character once again and to see what the genius Vince Gilligan has up his sleeve. However everything that I was afraid of this movie being, short of Walt being alive as a twist, was exactly what El Camino was. I did not see a good purpose for the film. I didn't think that the movie added much substance to what the show had already built. It seemed fairly meaningless and hollow as a six-years-later continuation for my favorite television series that has ever aired. I found the movie to be incredibly slow and boring for a good portion of it, particularly the first hour. I felt like a lot of the writing, and even some of the acting, was fairly weak, particularly in comparison to the series that it is a continuation for. The story was not a strong one, and it felt like it lacked energy, and I feel like this all comes down to the writing and the weakness of the story, particularly the plot of the Todd flashbacks. Another issue that I found with the movie is the weird, distracting inconsistencies with how the characters looked. Todd was much bigger in this film than he was in Breaking Bad, and it is incredibly noticeable. Jesse's beard was too long at the beginning of this film.It was easy to see that Bryan Cranston was wearing a bald cap for the Walter White flashback. These things may seem trivial, but for me, inconsistencies like these are important, particularly when you're working on a movie that is this big. The crew of Breaking Bad worked hard to make sure everything was realistic and worked will in continuity, etc, but this film did not manage to achieve this same feat. Basically my main issue with El Camino was that it seems unnecessary. The plot did not seem strong enough and like it added enough substance to the series that it builds on and in this, I do not see a good purpose for it have being made. This all isn't to say that everything about the movie is terrible. Aaron has some wonderful acting in this movie. It has some good writing here and there, even if overall the story and dialogue felt fairly weak to me. There is some amazing direction and cinematography, and it does have some interesting moments here and there inside of the movie. But they do come rather rarely and in the end, it doesn't make up for how hollow El Camino feels. If you're not looking for a movie that does anything particularly special or add much substance to what Breaking Bad had already made and you're just looking to see the exact events that happened to Jesse after Breaking Bad, even if they are not all that unexpected or surprising, then this is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a film that has a great purpose to it, something special that it does, and one that holds the same energy and brilliance as its predecessor series then you will be incredibly disappointed. Ultimately the movie doesn't work without the series that came before and it doesn't work well enough in correlation with the series that came before. Breaking Bad already had incredible closure with its final episode Felina, and this movie seemed unnecessary and hollow of a good purpose for its existence. I have seen Breaking bad about 3 years ago and I was so excited about this movie. The movie is actually good, but I just wish they gave us more of Walter White. And also I felt like there is something missing may be bcuz I have seen the show long time ago, so I don't remember every thing. I really had a very high expectations and I think that might be the reason I'm giving it only a 7 stars. Any it's such a good movie I would totally recommend it to anyone have seen the show. A little bit unnecessary, not really interesting, kinda looks cheap, but a nice closure for Jessie, that's basically it... It's so easy to take for granted, but a role model can simply make or break a person. I grew up fatherless with varying input from a big catholic family. I enjoyed my upbringing but subconsciously knew that I missed out on this key person. Vince G is masterful in relating fundamental questions and Jessie's recapturing of his life was the only story worthy of answering. I expected more of it to me it felt like it was a joker movie overrated It's not bad, I liked it just for characters but it doesn't have anything new
The first I was so happy because I thought Walter is alive! ðŸ˜¬ I only write reviews WITHOUT spoilers, but for this one, it's almost impossible to do this movie justice without going into spoilers, so this will be short!<br/><br/>The headline says it all. For the first hour, this movie does NOT really feel like Breaking Bad, but in a typical BB fashion, this slow pieced movie slowly gets to its overload of fan-service and typical ending, that serves as the perfect epilogue for the Pinkman story with a few to many flashback sequences.<br/><br/>This movie couldn't possibly live up to its expectations and that's totally ok. It still is a joyride, of a slow paced breaking bad encore that no fan wants to miss! It has to be first 2 chapters of 6th season. Too slow, not much of a story at all.
I'm big fan of Breaking Bad and Aaron but the movie isn't that level...Worth watching only if you love BB. It was enjoyable to be back amongst some of the great characters of Breaking Bad and El Camino does a good job in that regard.<br/><br/>I really like the pace and how it looks. The flashbacks were well executed and it was neat how they informed the main story.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul really is a great actor and Jesse Pinkman is an excellent character. El Camino really exploits its best asset very well indeed. That was the best thing about it.<br/><br/>It is a very strong dramatic device to have someone that has been dragged into all this at the heart of the story. They were able to contrast Jesse's reactions to events with those of the psychopathic mentality around him and this made for much entertainment.<br/><br/>I have given it 7 but I would have like to have given it a 7.5, maybe a little more actually, but I don't feel it is an 8.<br/><br/>There were two problems with it which are both central to a drama like this.<br/><br/>(1) The main adversary was weak. It is a problem with a sequel to Breaking Bad that all the first class bad guys of that series have been finished off so the creators have to dream up a new one. There is enough time in two hours to develop something really good, but it didn't do that.<br/><br/>(2) The plot wasn't clever enough.<br/><br/>If (1) and (2) had been improved on then it would have a 9 from me. To get a 10 for me there needs to be some sort of innovation, but I would never have expected that from this, all the innovation has been done already in Breaking Bad. You shouldn't go into this movie thinking it's a Breaking Bad sequel. It's not. Netflix liked to think and imply to everyone that it's a sequel but it is far from it. This isn't your typical Breaking Bad finale, car machine guns, ricin poisoning, people blowing up. This is a satisfying, not perfect, ending to Jesse Pinkmans story. Vince Gilligan placing Todd Alquist in this movie was very smart. I didn't like Todd in Breaking Bad but loved him in El Camino. The singing scene was my favorite scene of the movie, and one od my fabroite One of the things I loved about the tv shows was the suspense which some situations created. This film has that in places. Plot was average. At times, direction was unclear. Don't watch this. It's a waste of your time. The movie doesn't have anything to do with breaking bad. In "Breaking Bad", Jesse Pinkman's character arc was perhaps the saddest most tragic, and at times overshadowed by that of Walter White's. "El Camino" focuses soley on Jesse and Vince Gilligan gives the character a well-deserved and satisfying ending. Aaron Paul gives it all as he plays the character a last time, resulting in the performance of his life. Every move, every word spoken feels like he is putting as much effort in as possible and it's a true joy to watch. With absence of any major characters, even though Skinny Pete and Badger are wonderful to see again, "El Camino" is Paul's movie. He carries it - more or less - alone from start to finale, with a memorable last performance from Robert Forster. The film deserts much from the bombastic series final of the series form which it spawn, but at its best moment, "El Camino" paralyzes you, as you hope Pinkman will get out of the situation unharmed. This is not a film for those who hasn't watched "Breaking Bad"; it relies somewhat on nostalgia. The opening scene with the always fantastic Jonathan Banks, the chilling performance of Jesse Plemmons, Porter's astounding soundtrack, and of course, the moment we all hoped would come, the return of Bryan Cranston as Walter White. The flashback scene with Walt and Jesse talking at a diner is the - without a doubt - best moment from the entire film, the writing, performances, cinematography, everything about it is superb. Brilliant. Just as the rest of the film. While it never fully reaches the unpredictable storytelling of "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul", "El Camino" ends the entire saga well. And I can't do anything else but to love it. Cool to see what happened with Jesse after and before walts death, but fat Todd and his buddy (both from Friday night lights) weight gain was way too distracting. Too hard to get over to think that that happened before the final show episode. Should have gotten him a trainer a few months before filming. Still a good watch, but had the potential for more. Brilliant shows what happened to jessie after final episode I thought probably be better for the best of series because of it deserve that, but we did not expect like that everyone knows the situation in the end of series, only thing we can say it was be better instead of that. This isn't a movie. It's a feature length TV episode. While it was enjoyable to spend more time with Jessie it really wasn't needed. The writer/director also missed an opportunity to make a great cat and mouse chase between the police and Jessie. At no point in the movie did I feel Jessie was in danger and it fell a little flat. If you are a Breaking Bad fan it's definitely worth watching and enjoyable without being great. If you have never watched BB before then you will likely see this as a pretty poor movie. Great way to end Jesse's story yes some actors look different but that's what happens after so many years lol if you love breaking bad this is for you. I don't see how any Breaking Bad fan can not want to see this movie. It's alright if not out of this world.
Even with a recap at the start this movie relies a bit on remembering what happened in Breaking Bad. Even though I watched BB twice through I had forgotten quite a lot of details so had to concentrate and think back as to what happened to follow this movie. And there are some flashbacks in time that are slightly confusing but you do get it after a while.<br/><br/>This is the story of Jesse Pinkman after the shootout is what's told here. Like seeing some old friends. Aaron Paul is intense as ever. Jesse Plemons looks puffier. There are some tense moments. Some may find themselves disappointed because it's not that nail biting or emotionally involving as BB but I'm happy enough just to see some old familiar faces and get some closure. The movie remained true to the series, if you are expecting anything to top the finale, how could you? But it is a perfect representation of the series and an appropriate ending. If you haven't seen it, just enjoy it as you did each episode. I loved it... Some people complaining about Todd I don't have any problem with fat Tod Aaron Paul brings his A game to this wrap up of the series. Must watch for any fan of the series. A nice coda to Breaking Bad, but slightly underwhelming. The biggest offence is the decision to retcon antagonists into the plot completely unnecessarily, which feels uncharacteristically amateurish from a writer as accomplished as Gilligan.<br/><br/>Despite this, and the fact that much of the film is composed of flashbacks, El Camino is rescued by universally wonderful performances, beautiful visuals and Charles Baker's Skinny Pete as possibly the most likeable minor character in film or television this decade. One of the things that made Jesse Pinkman in the series "Breaking Bad" so appealing was his peripheral presence in a series that was almost exclusively about Walter White. The element that I found lacking in "Breaking Bad" was the real depth of pain for every character besides Walter. The series was always about this relatively average, mild mannered middle aged man who, through financial necessity due to an expensive battle with cancer, evolved into a drug kingpin, being changed at a fundamental level far more by that than the cancer that was likely killing him. It was a very fascinating and intriguing story about someone, very much like the vast majority of us, making us contemplate how we would react if we became a gangster. It was great theater, fun to watch, and had excellent production and acting to enhance some excellent and clever stories. Yet, it left me lacking. It was a great series but not perfect.<br/><br/>This movie is great in two ways. One, it does give some real closure to Jesse, a slacker kid from high school who happens to stumble upon every stoner's dream but finds it is filled with and leads to very tragic circumstances. We are confronted with all of his horrors in painful but needed detail. It also fills in many blank elements of his history and, in certain fashions, makes his life the most compelling and sympathetic of all the "Breaking Bad" characters.<br/><br/>The second great element is that it lathers on the agonies, fears, humanity, and hopes of Jesse in a very saturated yet not overdone way. Anyone who has ever experienced real tragedy (which will eventually include all of us) and those who have witnessed it up close (ditto) will know that these elements can never be overdone if you're trying to compare them to the real, agonizing ones. Aaron Paul's performance is as good as any that earned him his well deserved emmys. This film will give you lots of food for thought, even personal reflections, and is worthy of repeated viewings to appreciate many of its well done elements. El Camino, everyone excepting a movie worth or on par with breaking bad.They have taken a five years to make this movie ,so expectations are high but its only a average movie with a same type of story we have seen before..
Acting is superb and Vince have the same pace and continuing story line but when you know how great Vince is, its a disappointment.. It is not a second finale or a sequel but in fact a glimpse of something we all deeply missed for a long time. Everything is neatly dosed just like the journey had never ended. But in fact it is great to see Aaron Paul to catch up with something he also missed for some time too. He closes some loose ends brilliantly with his pure acting.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable and the cinematography is tasteful even a bit better than the series but in the end it is more like a collectors piece rather than a thriller. If you are a true fan of the series you will enjoy every second of the next two hours. If you haven't watched the series it wont be legit to spend your time. It's a normal movie
Nothing special
I think it was a good idea if they didn't make it Good suspense on several occasions but without doubt of Jessie's safety, as it was always expected to be a happy ending for him. As a two hour movie it would have been difficult to create a dynamic and complex plot, especially now that the main antagonists have been killed off towards the end of the series. Taking this into consideration, they have done a good job with this film and I can say that I really enjoyed it. Its just like a final final episode focusing on Jesse Pinkman; and for that, its great.
Just watch it, enjoy 2 hours.
You want a machine gun bloodbath, you're dissapointed, thats not Jesse, thats Walter's devolution into something worse then Fring.
El Camino lets you know AGAIN AND AGAIN, Jesse is NOT Walter. The pacing is more better call saul than breaking bad, but it gives us and Jesse closure and i'm sure any true b.b fan will be happy to add this to the collection. It's a nice farewell to Jessie and, I got to say that I expected a lot of this movie, but it's diffucult to surpass the masterpiece of Breaking Bad, thing that El Camino didn't do. It's a bit 'flashback-dependent' but at the end they're necessary for the storytelling of the movie. Pretty good, BUT TODD'S FAT.
Fun fact: I liked Walter's flashback :) Good to watch but over rated. It's like you watching couple of extra episodes of the series. (Minor spoilers)<br/><br/>There was no need for this movie. And I dock one mark for that simple fact. Classic vince gilligan being a sell out (joke but not really). Fat todd was so distracting and took me out of the story at times. Amazing writing, acting, cinematography and in my opinion the dialogue was top notch. Jesse and Todd talk about the weather for about 2 minutes and it's so interesting. It's dark with humour. I hated Bryan Cranston's bald cap. It was so obvious. This movie is a tribute to the character. Another excellent character study. I feel as though it should of been a mini series. I get that it was from jesses point of view but why did they not show what skinny and badger did after Jesse left. So here we are after 7 years of anticipation and hype. The question we can finally ask is 'does it deliver?' Needless to say the hopes were sky high for this film to live up to the expectations and standards of BB, and if you have seen Better Call Saul, then you know that Vince Gilligan has not lost his touch when it comes to crafting dramatic, intense stories and scenarios surrounding intriguing and memorable characters. He really is a master at what he does, and although masters can make mistakes too, rest easy because Gilligan is in full form here. As is everybody involved.<br/><br/>I try to keep my hype in check for things like this. Revivals and long awaited sequels and prequels have a long a complicated history of being hard to land, which is at the very least, a testament to how great the original story was. BB hooked fans from the beginning and help them all the way until the bittersweet finale, which is widely regarded as one of the best conclusions to a television serious of this stature ever made. So in that, I knew I could trust the old team to come back and tie a satisfying knot to a MAJOR story line thread that could be seen as a loose end. It was as if all the other major players in BB had their stories wrapped up, but Jesse, the main supporting character in the show and most people's favorite character, just... "got away."<br/><br/>And I was STILL more than satisfied. But of course I, and the rest of us who finished the show, was left with one nagging though.. what the hell is Jesse going to do now? And after watching El Camino, it really feels like Vince had always meant to tell you this story from the beginning. Even if he didn't know right away WHAT he wanted to do with Jesse, he knew something had to be done. This is one of the biggest reliefs to me as a fan of the show. All I didn't want was for this to feel cheap and just made to rekindle the former glory of the show or make some money. And I'm so glad to say that it is quite the opposite. Really, it feels even less like it was even made out of passion or Vince had such a genius idea that he just had to get it out. No, it's feels more like it was made because it should've been made. Because we didn't really get closure with Jesse, and I think Vince figured we deserved it. That aspect of this film makes it so pure and real to me, as if this is all based on a true story.<br/><br/>So how is it? Well it's pretty great. Even with the absence of some huge supporting characters, the story is perfectly held up and balanced on Jesses shoulders. It's his story, his ending. So while there were certainly parameters to stay within for story purposes to go along with the show, the possibilities of what could happen were endless. There were no other loose ends, nobody else with grudges, no money owed, no more gang or drug lords, just Jesse trying to figure out how the hell to get out of New Mexico and not get put back in a cage for the rest of his life. It's a whole new direction, a new chapter that is opened and closed in a two hour runtime. We get new and returning characters, all of which are well written and fully realized as usual. There are flashback sequences, but they're never egregious and all serve a point for the narrative or for Jesses character. The story and scenarios are both very taught and entertaining as well, and every scene is performed with vigor by all those on screen, especially our lead, Aaron Paul, who I really cannot praise enough for his performance here. He IS Jesse again. He hasn't lost that character all, it's clearly a part of him and always will be. And with the careful, smart writing from our boy VG, the cast shines here.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very pleasantly satisfied with this conclusion, and I will say that's about it. I wasn't blown away with anything story wise really, and found myself enjoying and appreciating the execution over anything. But this is a must watch for any BB fan and it will most likely satisfy who it was made for. Because in the end, that's why it was made. Spoilers are ahead... You were warned.<br/><br/>So I'm going to keep this short and sweet.<br/><br/>One flash back of Walter White was all this movie needed because the series of Breaking Bad ended perfectly with Walter White's death... Yes... He is dead.<br/><br/>All good things must come to an end but Jessie Pinkman was good enough to carry this extended back-to-back episode/movie to finally give fans closure to one of the greatest series ever made.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul nails the role of Pinkman again and it brought nostalgia just seeing him and a few other characters once again. It shows us that Breaking Bad was indeed a two person show and not just Walter White.<br/><br/>This was a satisfying movie... For years all I've ever wanted was just something extra after Breaking Bad ended... And this was enough. Just the right amount of fan service and Jesse's story conclusion.<br/><br/>Classic tense moments with cops, gangs and cunning moments make this a blast from the past.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 for the crazy ride once again... I'm glad they didn't bring Walter back because it would have lessened everything that happened in the main series.<br/><br/>Good bye Breaking Bad... If only I could wipe my memory to rewatch you again. Not a masterpiece like many are saying but closes the story of Jesse Pinkman nicely. According to Trailers, I expected much more. El Camino couldn't move me as it should.
I wanted to see deep investigations of Police and DEA around this case. It's funny that we didn't see any cops at El Camino!! The main thing we saw in trailers was the heavy presence of Cops in chasing of Jesse.
Next, It was all about gathering some money for going to Alaska!!! 90% of the movie was about Todd's house !!!! IT IS AWWWWWFULLLL!!! we wanted to see about a secret about Jesse or Walter not DAMN TODD!!!!!
then Jane and Walter appear in the end regarding Jessie's interests. At least the last parts about Jesse's interests MUST have been longer than it was.<br/><br/>I see el camino as a 90% waste of time.. It couldn't satisfy me at All...
It was better to promote movie as a secret of Todd. Not the way jesse wanted to go I had mixed emotions when this film was announced as breaking bad had the perfect ending, I was excited yet worried that a good thing may be ruined, it wasn't, this film was brilliant. The story itself was not the action packed drama we know and love from the series, but an intense look into what became of Jesse Pinkman in the days after his escape, and I'm fine with that. It was great to see some of the old characters back in flashback scenes, and these scenes really added to the breaking bad story, which was nice to see. Acting wise, Aaron Paul was incredible, which came as no surprise, but for me Jesse Plemons was a star in this film, Todd was a very disturbing person, this really shine through, great job. So now we know how Jesse's story ended, and it's pretty much how I imagined it/hoped it would be. So was there any need for it... Arguments could be made either way but I enjoyed it and that's what really counts, if you love the TV series then watch it and you won't be disappointed. Its Not Bad Movie But I Was Hopeing Somtihng Better But Bo Problem It gave a pretty great feeling about the series. It was the same Vince Gilligan'esque type of directing having several hot moments and gradual story telling. I first watched Breaking Bad with my dad when I was in school. I'm finishing college now and we stayed up until 5AM just to be able to relive our glory days. Honestly, I went into this movie with the wrong expectations. I wanted to see a fleshed out story with character arcs and a common structure. The thing is, El Camino isn't a story, it's a story's epilogue. El Camino gives Breaking Bad viewers the closure they didn't know they wanted. The acting from everyone is phenomenal, especially from Aaron Paul, who is amazing as always. The visuals are spectacular, Vince Gilligan is a master with the camera. A few characters come back, and they made me tear up a little bit. Vince said this movie could be enjoyed without watching Breaking Bad, but I don't really think that's the case. Without nothing else to say, goodbye Jesse Pinkman. It's been one hell of a ride. Throughout this film I was completely engrossed. Remembering the Breaking Bad show is a key part to this, there are many Easter eggs that I noticed. Aaron Paul is a phenomenal actor and I would love to see another one. Great but unnecessary.
The best serie ever with a great movie finale... "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we follow the story of Jesse Pinkman after the ending of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because it was a good closure not only of "Breaking Bad" but also of Jesse Pinkman and what happened to him after the end of "Breaking Bad". For one more time Aaron Paul who played as Jesse Pinkman was simply amazing and in addition to some other interpretations of the "Breaking Bad" series made this movie so interesting. Finally, I have to say that "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" is a must watch movie for the fans of "Breaking Bad". El Camino - Action, Thriller Movie
Cast - Aaron Paul<br/><br/>It is a breaking bad movie. This movie is a sequel to "Breaking Bad" - a marvelous tv series. Though it is hard to understand this movie without watching Breaking Bad. This movie is finishing touch which explains what happened later with Jesse Pinkman(A major Role) after Breaking Bad. This is more of an episode rather than a movie. It has some heart touching dialouges just like Breaking Bad. This movie shows how only Jesse survives and move to Alaska for having a new life. A perfect icing on the cake this is.<br/><br/>This movie has some irrelevant screenplay to make audience understand how Jesse was tortured. But lack of casting they could not show it properly. Moreover, many questions were still unanswered after this movie. No further update on Walt's family, Saul Goodman or current drug business situation. This movie only shows the story of 2 days after finishing of breaking bad. The last scene was so peaceful I don't know why. This movie is not good as the main series butthere is no doubt that every BB lover will watch this surely after finishing BB. Recommended but I am dissappointed.<br/><br/>Personal Rating - 5.5/10 Jesse deserves the ending!and it is awesome!
Movie Is awaome! El Camino<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie for what is was, a chance to meet old friends and tie up a few loose ends.<br/><br/>It is totally for the fan base of Breaking Bad and it must be enjoyed on that level as it is not a stand alone project and would be quite meaningless if you had not watched what had gone before.<br/><br/>6/10 This isn't a stand-alone movie. There are constant references to things done in the series and if you aren't familiar, this movie is pointless. Continues from where BB left off, it was nice to tie up Jesse's story but it was very rushed. I would have preferred it to have been a 3/4 part mini series.
But overall, its an okay movie. I fell asleep. Don't waste your time with this one. ðŸ˜´ Where's the masterful suspense? The wit? The brilliant plotting from BB? Really, where's everything? Right now I feel you have betrayed maybe the greatest legacy in all of TV series history. Aw, really BB guys? What is this? And why? Actually it was worse than okay. Very slow paced & long movie and nothing much happened. We also had flashbacks back and forth. In general, it was boring to be honest. I think people are giving it such a big rating because of Breaking Bad name and universe. In reality this movie had zero tense and zero intrigue comparing to Breaking Bad TV show. It was just plain bad. In short story, it could have been much better. Felt like they tried to sum up 5 episodes in one. Unexcused delay in the storyline, unnecessary scenes stretched with no meaning and in the middle Aaron Paul trying to save anything he could. Critical points like how did he escaped, probably got lost in the translation.
I'm disappointed. The fact that is in Breaking Bad universe, doesn't save it. Jesse Pinkman deserved much much better. When will writers write something that isn't overly written, i.e. what they would like it to sound like, rather than what it actually would sound like? Meaning if we could write out daily life it would be perfect, but it would never happen that way. There is a saying, you are wise before your interview, wise after your interview, but OTHERWISE during your interview. All the things you would like to say or should have said never come out when you say it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately writers write screenplays where they have the time to over think situations, dialogue characters etc, and they forget that sometimes you just need to let your thoughts play out on paper the way they do in life without the extra time to make it perfect by over-explaining everything and create phony rhythms between characters like a perfect tennis match back and forth back and forth.<br/><br/>Let's put aside, the badly written dialogue, but we have to swallow that Jesse is on the loose with the country after him, but he can take 20 min or so to get a car even thought the cops have been alerted that there is a stolen car.<br/><br/>They really just tried too hard . with this totally unnecessary movie, other than to rake in some cash like most movies in Hollywood. Obviously movies need to make money, BUT you don't make a money JUST to make money.<br/><br/>It would also have been nice if they bothered to give us a brief summary of previous scenes that led up to this since it's been a while since I watched Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>And I remembered why I hated Jesse's character in Breaking Bad. Such an annoying loser... makes one terrible decision after the other.<br/><br/>There was no reason to make this and I was bored throughout. It was like watching paint dry.... SKIP IT! This movie puts Jesse in a different role and a role that Aaron Paul cannot my handle. His ability to lead a movie has always been very week. The plot is fragile and the movie really shouldn't have been made at all. Expected a decent thrilling climax after binge watching 5 seasons just last week. When the climax is a 20sec western shoot out after a slow start and slow flashbacks, i think the movie is pointless. Jesse driving out at the end of s5 was good enough. Breaking bad was awesome. The end gave me closure. But this movie? I see no point to it. It actually has no story. Full of flashbacks. I won't say I'm disappointed, it's a good ending scene for Jessie. But again, no story, no context. This is a total waste of time, added nothing, too long, dragged, Boring and just a poor film, this didn't need to be made, just a cash grab.. Wow. How did they come up with such a boring "need cash to escape to Alasca"-story with some irrelevant scenes from the past interleaved (at random occasions, with almost no relevance to the present movie time)? Those scenes from the past hit the floor of the cutting room for a reason, too, as it seems: They do not reveal a mole more of information about any character that we did not already know.<br/><br/>Known characters? Yes, they do appear, but mostly either as flashback (scenes that did not make it into the series), or very shortly and mostly irrelevant to the story.<br/><br/>There is lots of (boring) sneaking, hiding and searching for cash, some forgettable characters - and even a ridiculous and totally pointless wild west shooting - and almost no story which adds anything to Jesse's character.<br/><br/>A missed opportunity (if such a thing was required at all for such a great series). El Camino added nothing new or exciting to the Breaking Bad plot. Everything that happened could've been very easily predicted. It's a two hour movie with about 30 minutes of content. Since the actors are obviously older, the film could've shown what was up with Skylar, Walter Jr., Jesse, Saul, and everyone else 10 years later. Maybe Jesse is off married to some new girl in Alaska. Walter Jr. is a social pariah, rich with the 10M Walt left him but is now a meth addict. Skylar is a deadbeat mom and Grey Matter went bankrupt. Saul changed his name, moved to Europe and is the same shiesty lawyer over there. But, I guess we'll never know.. It was a slow ride, with trailer that wasn't even in the movie. There where no excitement. It was boring. There where no reason to do this movie. Jesse character without Walter White is plain boring. As a Breaking Bad fan I am truly dissapointed. Bring me back the time i spent watching this bad movie Very poor story, poor content... I was expecting so much more. Story that could last 20 mins turned into 2hrs I honestly dont understand the amount of people upset over this. Is it a masterpiece? No. But It did was it was meant to do in wrapping up pinkmans story. Had intense moments. Gave people some of the BB cast they wanted. I saw people saying wasnt worth the 6 year wait..... It literally went public like 2 months before release... ratings of 6 and below is just ridiculous. Even comparing with the perfection Of the show it's not a "4" movie. You wanna rate 4s and such watch movies like birdemic or going overboard. I mean really guys? The movie didn't undo anything from the show. It didnt add any ridiculous story or sorry attempts to be shocking, it was just a good continuation and ending to a story. And as in all Vince's BB world. The acting was on point. This was too long for how little of a after story they had to tell. Flashback sequences too long and too frequent.<br/><br/>Felt like something was missing in the production. Just not as well done as the average breaking bad episode. Not dynamic. Not exciting. Very forced. This is an awesome addition to the breaking bad lore. i loved it. well directed with great cinematography. high quality movie in general. well acted and very funny. lots of cool connections to the show. intense and suspenseful. leave it to breaking bad to do a reunion/spinoff well. (1 viewing 10/28/19) Well, from beginning to end this movie was slow, meandering, dull and felt thrown together.<br/><br/>All's well that ends, and if you go against good counsel and watch this stinker, you be glad when it ends. Nothing to write but bad acting bad storyline ect ect BB is the best series I have seen, so anything that would take me bck to see all those ppl bck would be enough for me to keep me glued.. The movie was kind of a closure for all who wanted to know what happened to white.. I was one seeking it.. I am happy to get that ans.. The series was arguably the most well-written and performed series I can remember. I wasn't having too high expectations on this movie, I mean, the main character surely wouldn't come back from the dead? Though, I was hoping for some plot twist along the way. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most meaningless and dull movie experiences for me, ever. I honestly do not see the point why this was made. Neatly ties up what happened to Jesse<br/><br/>Nothing special but still watchable Brilliant, Nostalgic, True to origin, Satisfying, Pays homage to original characters, Provides an apt ending to the best drama series ever made Man, this couldn't be told, like, faster? Good coulda been great without keeping all the paint drying in all the scenes. This is the movie based on the Breaking Bad show. This is the movie where you see where Jessie pinkman goes after he escapes from the jail. He goes to Alaska. But before he goes there he has to fight a lot of the guys who made him angry before when he was dealing drugs. A lot of these guys didn't know he was hiding a gun in his jacket so he shot them and then you got a way I'm talking about Jessie the younger guy not Walter the older guy. Walter died during Breaking Bad If you remember correctly. This is about Jesse and he goes to Alaska after fighting and shooting some guys. You get to see a lot of old characters but it's not like they're alive again. It's like you're seeing inside Jesse's memory. It gets pretty confusing at times cuz you don't know if it's his memory or his real life that you're watching but it's pretty close to a perfect movie kind of like one of those old great movies you have already seen from before. I'm a huge fan of breaking bad but this movie sequel or whatever did not live up to the standards of the show... with that said my reasoning is the acting wasnt as good or intense and the actors have all aged or gained so much weight and this is supposed to take place during the same time era. Nothing matches up. Just not what I expected wish they could've spent a little more time. The only character that looked the same was brian Cranston lol hes legit looked the same age for years. This is just the perfect end for Jesse of course the quality between Breaking Bad and El Camino is some and it's perfectly normal .
The flashbacks were so on point , that shows the other side of Walt that show us the love he had to Jesse , the advices of Mike , and the loyalty of Skinny and Badger ,the hard time that Jesse got throw but in the end that suffering he used to escaped and get his freedom and that knowledge he used to survive he knew were the money was , the Ed and that code to he helps him and even Jane telling him to make his own choices .
It still remain some questions to answer from Breaking Bad , but yeah ...
It's the end that Jesse Pinkman deserved a long time ago and the final story of the name Jesse Pinkman .
This movie was really good but maybe a spin off serie focused on Jesse would be better ...
10/10 . Breaking Bad best serie ever .
R.I.P Robert Forster A great goodbye to a wonderful character, Jesse was the heart of BB and fitting he said Goodbye in this way.<br/><br/>Loved the film and loved how it stayed true to Breaking Bad all the way through. Guys this movie it's close to perfect.. I don't know what you people want more
You have it all..
The cinematography..
The acting..
The characters..<br/><br/>Some comedy with badger and skinny P<br/><br/>This is literally felina for Jessie pinkman..<br/><br/>Thank you Vince G and follow writers... And netflix for this amazing gift<br/><br/>And if anybody needs me ill be rewatching this movie<br/><br/>Once again Ty Vince Gilligan and writing staff for this amazing movie MAGNIFICENT MAGICAL MYTHICAL WONDERFUL INERREST THAT MOMENT TO THE SAME TIME TO THE SAME TIME TO THE SAME I love this movie like they legendary series braking bad The best tv programme ever takes the story a little further, I wish there was more to come. That was problably the best ending that we could have, lived up to my expectations! Scenario makes me happy. awesome film but that must show skylers last look. Im excited for that . I had no hopes for this movie and it STILL managed to disappoint me.<br/><br/>Pros: only one good scene (shootout).<br/><br/>Cons: Nothing that happened matters. Bad acting. Jesse moves to Alaska. End. Not even close
They should never filmed this movie.
Who cares were Jesse will end. The movie was completely useless. It doesn't add anything really interesting to the breaking bad story. I don't understand the high rating. I have nothing more to add. This isn't a film, not by any stretch of the imagination. It's an extended final episode for Breaking Bad fans to get one last hit of their favourite series.<br/><br/>As far as actual films go, it just doesn't have anything to make it qualify as a real movie. There's no plot - no start, no end, no quest, no progress - nothing! It just drags on and on, following that one guy around while he 'does stuff'. I couldn't grasp any of it at all. It feels more like 2 hours of build-up to a narrative that never happens.<br/><br/>I suspect it would have been better if I knew something about Breaking Bad, but movies aren't supposed to rely on the audience having watched an entire TV series of background story beforehand. Utterly disappointing. Like the titles says, the movie is about Jessie trying to find money to pay the "dissapearing man" for 2 hours..<br/><br/>The movie has some interesting encounters here and there but ultimately the plot was horrible.<br/><br/>Also, the movie doesn't really have a "movie-format", it's just like an extended episode and just like in the episodes, there's plenty of dead-time where really nothing happens.<br/><br/>Found myself horribly uninterested in Todds and Jessies few moments that took up the first half of the movie but things did get a bit more interesting at the middle/the end.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 4 was because I was genuinely happy for Jessie at the end, knowing that he found his way towards a brighter future.<br/><br/>It's not a good movie straight up. The only 10/10 you'll see are from "Supernatural" fans. Aka fans that don't care that it's the 37th season of a series or the quality of the series. Simply, fans that just wanna know what happens to the characters and watches no matter what. Disappointing 2 hours of mainly unnecessary flashbacks. I was really looking forward for this. Doesn't deliver what I hoped to get at all. 3/10 max. Was ok, but didn't really see the point!! Didn't really add anything that we needed to know, and he looked about two stone heavier considering he'd been kept prisoner, they could have made him lose a bit of weight for the role. 2 hours of my life I will never get back. Nothing happened at all, glad when it finished!! 2 hours for THIS ???? SERIOUSLY NETFLIX YOU RUINED BREAKING BAD It's like another episode should not be playing in the movie theaters just on the TV shows Yes I loved it. I felt it was perfectly in keeping with the style of the series. El Camino ?! Not even worthy of anything to do with Breaking Bad. No continuity- no direction - no good. Vince Wtf??? Talk about a money grab This movie could have been made in a single 42 minute episode of breaking bad. Usually the detail in breaking bad was necessary or at least contributed and gave us more information that we craved. There were so many scenes in El Camino that could have been taken out and you wouldn't have noticed at all. All in all, it gave the fans some info about what happened with Jesse after the final episode, but it was very anticlimactic and a disappointment in my eyes I really don't get it. At all. Walt got what he deserved, unfortunately. I LOVED Walt until he started doing terrible things to people because at the beginning of the movie he was such a nice man, but he turned into a d bag who got killed and rightfully so. In Walt's journey to becoming a terrible person, he dragged down Jesse who wasn't the best in the beginning but he wasn't a bad kid, you could see he was just lost. Walt made him kill people and do a lot of stuff he didn't want to do. Why doesn't Jesse deserve a happy ending? The story tied up all the loose ends imo. Did Jesse deserve to rot in prison? Hell no! He was imprisoned by Walt while they were together and then again by the Nazi d bags quite literally. Idk what you people want. Wasted my time watching it. Nothing to do with breaking bad series ... just used its name and create something called empty baloon ... I need two things in a movie acting and a story you only get one here, this could have been wrote over a six pack of beer. Is it now hip and cool to not have a plot and a story ive see the same in the Saul series and have come to the conclusion this writer is just not deep enough, very boring. I see a lot of people complaining that this movie was not how they wanted it to be, and it was a rather simple story that needed no showing because the best ending for Jesse apparently is him driving off in the series finale.<br/><br/>This movie was not supposedly a movie, think of it is a breaking bad episode prolonged, this is what El Camino was, the finishing character arc of one of the greatest characters seen on television.<br/><br/>While Breaking bad solely revolved around Walt's purpose for doing what he did, Walt's purpose for involving Jesse. El Camino gives all the 2 hour attention to Pinkman and focuses on his closure and it surely takes its time.<br/><br/>This is El Camino's greatest strength, that it keeps the same pace as any other breaking bad episode and doenst rush into it because it is a movie.<br/><br/>Involvement of characters revolving around Jesse's life, his mental state throughout the torture he faces in season 5. All character introductions were placed at perfect time.<br/><br/>However this time, every character involvement adds more depth to idea of what Jesse pinkman was and has become throughout the course of breaking bad.<br/><br/>Him taking Mike's advice to move to Alaska, signifies almost as if Mike took a parental role to give him a peace offering given he walks out alive.<br/><br/>Jesse calling his parents to tell them that it's not their fault he turned out the way he did.<br/><br/>The small nuances, such as his reaction upon hearing on the radio the death of Walter White. It's almost as if it to say that even though he had come about to hating Walt for not saving Jane, being swallowed by own ego, feeding ricin to a small kid, in the end the journey was messy but Walt played a huge part of his later life.<br/><br/>The involvement of Todd and him being rather nice to Jesse, which was to perhaps signify in the end Todd did what he did only for business and as a person he was perhaps not that bad.<br/><br/>Maybe the fact that half of the screen time of the film is given to Todd, is to remind us that he died of choking, maybe he didnt deserve such a ruthless death?<br/><br/>The involvement of Walt explaining Jesse that his true calibre academically stands in Business and Marketing<br/><br/>Skinny Pete and Badger in the end truly coming out and saving his life because Pinkman's friendship meant a lot to him, so much that he was a "hero" to Skinny.<br/><br/>These are just a few scenes that add so much depth to not just Jesse but every other character involved.<br/><br/>There are some really gripping scenes such as the wild west style shoot out that particularly stood out, and all of it is just topped by Aaron Paul's tremendous acting.<br/><br/>Truly a fantastic watch, and a great end for what will probably be one of the most memorable characters in television history. Vince is a legend. I had the nostalgia Breaking Bad feeling during the movie. The way how the story telling and illustration was build up was intense for my nerves. I love how they kept the same energy and level without overshadowing or destroying the picture of Breaking Bad. It's definitely art to add something legendary to the best series ending ever made.<br/><br/>If you love Breaking Bad and always wondered how Jesse's road continues, then you'll find satisfaction.<br/><br/>Not to forget it was a nice act to see so many familiar faces from the series once again. I won't name drop over here.<br/><br/>Don't listen to bad critics those are people that expected lame action with stupid stunts and something like that.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul deserves an Oscar. He reached Bryan Cranston level. He developed as an actor so much. He really reached his peak. People say this can't be nominated for an Oscar only for Grammys. Well... the movie was shown in selected theaters so why not ? I haven't seen Joker yet, but at the moment I'm so emotionally tied up with the El Camino movie. It hits me on a different way. Man I'm done. I even applauded when I finished it. The cinematography and the quality is so amazing that you wish Breaking Bad was produced in 2019.<br/><br/>My only critic is that I wished the movie would've lasted a little longer so I could enjoy more minutes.<br/><br/>Fantastic Work Mr. Vince Gilligan! Through out the all movie i was happy and amazed and this is a rly nice way to show the faith of jesse pinkman. Im traying to put in words what was my expirience but beside saying im happy i have nothing else to say cus u gotta watch it to understand what im talking about, so grab a popcorn and watch it, enjoy it and be open minded ofc. Amazing as always, the best acting and story . I love it . It did worth it the waiting. Don't hesitate to watch it !!!! I've always loved Breaking Bad and this movie just gives us the most perfect closure for out favorite character. When Music started in Recap, I literally started crying. It hits so hard. Wow. Thanks for this beautiful show.<br/><br/>Love you all who made this happen. This is the best show in my lifetime. Aaron Paul as Jessy was phenomenal. Jessy being in pain and distress is outstandingly portrayed by Aaron here. Jessy had the best friends looking out for him. Did not expected Jane at the end of the movie which may caused me shed some tears.
Overall fantastic movie. It was worth waiting for. I recently re-watched the series millionth time and particularly the season 5 episodes and was yet again genuinely awed how good the series and AP especially was. Heartbreaking, intense, making us feel and love Jesse. And I think Aaron Paul is one of the most underestimated actors there is. But god now in this movie I couldn't see no Jesse, only Aaron Paul playing Jesse so so intensely in looooong pointless scenes that dragged on and on and I think I can't even watch him in the series any more. Jesse is ruined for me! The truth is Jesse needs Walt like Aaron needs Bryan. This was no Breaking Bad movie, only some movie placed in Breaking Bad universe. If u really loved breaking bad series then I suggest you to stay away from this slow paced...boring....cash-in sequel which have nothing to offer.
for like 2 hours u watch how jesse tries to run away from his past and start a new life. nothing really happens worth mentioning.
the breaking bad series ended for good in season 5 so let's move on with our lives. Couple of months ago I finally finished Breaking Bad. I know I was a bit latecomer but nonetheless I watched it. And Now it's my most favourite TV Series ever. So from a fan's perspective, a lot was anticipated after this film got announced. Me too was excited about this adaptation. But unfortunately the wait, the eagerness wasn't worthy at all. The film starts right after where the last episode of Breaking Bad ends. It now focuses all its attention towards Jesse Pinkman's character. While it engrossed you with clever choice of cinematography and a Solid background score. It forgets to add anything extra over the original show. Many fans here might argue they loved the film because that's the usual representation of Vince Gilligan's work. To be honest it's far away from what Vince Could possibly do. The storyline here just showcases tiny bits and pieces of Jesse as a character but never really dived deeper into his personality. It shows us the sufferings he bear In the past but never the traumas he's facing in the present time! The appearances of other major characters from the original show failed to leave a long-standing impression. Aaron Paul as Jesse nailed every scene he is in. There's no doubt about his excellency as an actor but With a hollow script as such; deprived him of a more memorable conclusion. They tried to wrap up his story here but that too does feel like incomplete in someways! As a whole this is an average movie that wasn't really needed in the universe of Breaking Bad which has already set up the standards miles high up. Please, stop this hemorhage.<br/><br/>Is this all what you got after all these years?
The scene on the room of the wielding co. its the only thing I'd save of it. Period. The script is very boring, I expect some more exciting!
This just did little entertaining, too far from the series. The movie was really good regarding Jesse. How he ended up was a really satisfying ending. Vince Gilligan never disappoints us. Breaking bad and after that, this movie are a once in a lifetime experience. Walter White told Jesse that you don't need to wait your whole life to do something special. And by saying something special, I think ever fan of BB knows what's that all about. He loves meth. He's good at. Another impressive scene is that Jane, Jesse's former "partner", said "I've gone where the universe takes me my whole life. It's better to make those decisions for yourself." After watching El Camino, I couldn't think of anything but those lines. And the path to Jesse's new identity is of self-revelation. The message I'm getting here is to be who you really are and do what you really want to do. The rest is not that important to you. I'm going to Australia this year. Was really a hard choice to be honest. But I'm glad I make this far. I hope Jesse enjoys his new environment, as I kinda hope that for myself. (Flash Review)<br/><br/>How did Jesse Pinkman's life play out immediately after the end of the Breaking Bad series? The Director, Vince Gillian, of Breaking Bad thought you should know so if you enjoyed the series, you'll enjoy this. He brings the same compelling storytelling, outstanding cinematography and top tier production quality to this effort. You follow Pinkman and the people in his small circle as he tries to escape and leave that part of his life behind. There are many tension-filled scenes as he crafts his plan. Will he make it or be captured by the highly publicized police dragnet? This is a worthy additional chapter in the overarching story. Lots cameos that brought you back to the original series...a couple decent scenes...but it was just boring... Because Nothing happens. There is nothing to say that could spoil the film, it just occupies time and then ends. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is that it came out just now... Yes, it might not be THE best movie ever, but it was THE best ending to something bigger.<br/><br/>After I watched Breaking Bad, it didn't really feel like an ending. Okay, it was an end to WW story, but I also liked Jessie as a character and he didn't get the same great ending. This movie managed to do that. Acting was great, Vince was great, again, story wasn't anything complex and big, but who cares?<br/><br/>It was perfect. Two hours of serious entertaining. Aaron Paul does another great job and all in all this is a great watch.
Especially if you marathon the series last season to refresh your memory like I did. However, fat Todd was a distraction or me. Usually shows that try to come back for a finale with a another season or a movie fail miserably. This one didn't! It is a fitting end to the story of the show's most intriguing character and reminded us of the masterpiece Vince Gilligan created. I thought this was amazing. So many people didn't. I dunno why. It was the ending to the his story that was needed. This isn't meant to be some OTT VFX feast. It's tried and tested storytelling. You get with that.. you get yourself a good night on the sofa watching Aaron Paul smash it. I loved BB and was excited for this movie but it's 182 minutes of mostly nothing. Was constantly zoning out and having to go back and re-watch. The timeline bounces around like a pinball. Flashback and flashforward so much you get whiplash. Do yourself a favor if you liked BB and skip. Just not as good as it could of been. The end of breaking bad was perfect. Why elaborate. A great movie with a nice smell from Breaking Bad
Free from the agendas of filth oligarchy
Thanks Netflix In a world riddled with non stop action, special fx, and beautiful storylines, this movie is to viewers as black and White, are to Skyler. What did we just view?<br/><br/>The plot of this film is a balance of "never before seen" flashbacks, and the progression of Pinkman from follower...to follower with a new name in Alaska.<br/><br/>Was there truly any point to this movie? "When i was a child, i talked like a child. I thought like a child. I reasoned like a child. When i became a man, i put the ways of childhood behind me."<br/><br/>That being said, Netflix has once again proven they are driven by childish wonder, and meaningless satisfaction.<br/><br/>If you love tales of the crypt or even tales of the absurd, this is your kind of film.<br/><br/>The franchise has been done a total disservice even though Aaron Paul is amazing, and has grown into a star. This is the only reason this move shouldn't get 0/0 Let's be honest. If you are a fan of BB, you're going to watch El Camino. No review I write should change that. Go ahead and watch it, smile at the cameos, feel the excitement at the unexpected W+J scene, fall in love with the loyalty shown by Skinny Pete and Badger. I felt all of those things, but not much more. The performances were outstanding - particularly Aaron Paul, Charles Baker, and Robert Forster. But the newly introduced characters carried no emotional weight. I guess it all went to Todd's cheeks. 100% breaking bad all the way. Great flick and leaves you wanting more just like the series. Acting is spot on and jumped right back in the thick of it. There is a reason the series is one of the best shows ever made. Great writing and great acting. El Camino carries the legacy on. Make a sequel or better yet, a new series with Jessie on the run!!! Awesomeness!!! I was not impressed by the trudging sexist violence of the first three-quarters of the movie... however the last quarter BLEW ME AWAY. Starting with the scene with Aaron Paul & Bryan Cranston and then the scene with Kyrstin Ritter ... They were unbelievably powerful and wonderful and poignant and lovely. Mr. Paul did a spectacular job of coming through at the end as a fully robust emotional and sophisticated character. Wow. I enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Faithful to the characters story arc, a basically decent bloke who was influenced into making poor decisions. The film explored the moral crises he has to face to leave it all behind and a reminder that not everything in life ends with a bang, but more often with a whimper.<br/><br/>But I could just as easily live with not having seen it. I thought the downside was shoehorning in so many tangential characters, their seeming retrospective value to Jesse felt contrived.<br/><br/>An interesting addendum but far from essential. First of, this isn't a stand-alone movie. You will need to watch the Breaking Bad series. Otherwise, a lot of things won't make much sense.
If you watched it and it's been a while, I recommend rewatching the last few episodes.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Breaking Bad fan from the day that show first aired and was stoked when Better Call Saul came out, which I watch religiously.<br/><br/>I can appreciate this production for its awesome cinematography and superb acting. But that is where it ends.<br/><br/>The story line is dull and boring. You keep hoping for a Breaking Bad style "OMG" moment but it never comes.
Lots of "are you serious?" parts in it where actions/behaviors are extremely unrealistic or "out of character" for Jesse Pinkman.<br/><br/>For comparison:
Breaking Bad - Five Course Dinner at a 5 Star Restaurant.
Better Call Saul - Three Course Dinner at a 5 Star Restaurant
El Camino - Double Cheeseburger with Curly Fries at a fancy Burger Joint<br/><br/>I can't give this more than 7 Stars. It was always going to be a very difficult task to follow up on the incredible TV series BB but this was a pretty good job. The plot and the characters drew you into the old story once again and continued to keep you interested and intrigued throughout. No real conclusion as Jessie has changed identity and hopes to remain anonymous in Alaska but he is alive and well which leaves the door open for further episodes. One further question - Did Water White really die in the BB shoot out?
Loved El Camino but leaves me wanting more! No spoilers...<br/><br/>If you are a huge Breaking Bad / Better Call Saul fan, you definitely watched this movie the day it dropped. Regardless, expectations were sky high for this one and if you were completely satisfied to the brim, you should watch it again. If you happened to be let down in any way...you should watch it again.<br/><br/>Why? I personally went in with said super-high expectations and I left slightly emptier than what I would've liked. I thought it was great but I remarked to my buddy, "It was what it needed to be. A solid 8." And that was that...read some reviews that picked up on some cool Easter eggs from not just BB, but a couple from BCS as well. And on went my weekend.<br/><br/>So here I am just relaxing two days later on a Sunday by myself and I decided to throw it on again, not expecting to finish it but just sort of re-watch it like I have with any episode of either of its parent shows...and you know what? I upped my rating to a 9 after the second viewing. Somehow I was even more drawn in. I didn't even pause it once. So many subliminal details that get missed on any first viewing - I caught many subtle throwbacks and nods to BB/BCS along with being able to digest the story as a whole rather than sit in a weird anticipatory mood for the whole two hours...I knew who was / was not in the movie from characters past and present, I knew the outcome, but now I was able to take the time to appreciate the story, the visuals, the soundtrack, and the acting...and damn, is it all tastefully high-quality. Even the slightly different color palette and texture of the film felt astonishingly appropriate. Team Gilligan doesn't accept anything but near perfect - even their occasional slip-up is a "B" at worst!<br/><br/>This movie plays out more like an episode of BCS than BB, so (re)watch it with that frame of mind, and it will click into its deserved place in the fictional universe. VG and gang continue to impress.<br/><br/>Next stop - BCS Season 5! This movie is a great watch for fans of the show - giving Jesse Pinkman a true ending. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was spot on! The story was simple and to the point and everything shown pushed the story forward or gave reason to things Jesse was doing. I really enjoyed this movie and felt like it was a true farewell to Jesse. When the film was first announced I was unsure if it was a good idea. After watching el Camino I now know it was. Really enjoyed seeing the characters again and getting an insight into what jessie had been through during his captivity. It's nice to see a conclusion for jessie after all his suffering 10/10 perfect scores for this are a bit silly and probably given by die hard fans of the T.V. series. I guess it wasn't easy to make it great with the main star from the T.V. series missing (he died in the last episode). However I feel it lacked imagination. I would have made Jesse end up running his own drug business out of Mexico and becomming more like the guy he grew to hate, "Mr. White". This film doesn't really cover much. Just his struggle to escape the law. El Camino is real let down in my opinion. I had lots of issues with it and it is nothing compared to the brilliance of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. It spends way to much time on flashbacks that are only there to explain why Jesse is doing something which isn't at all interesting as we want to see what happens after not before and is also lazy as they are just showing us.<br/><br/>El Camino also feels like its just an overly long episode and has a very slow pace throughout. It feels like it should have been an additonal last episode to Breaking Bad and not the 'event' Netflix was calling it. However, if it had been an episode of the show the pacing would probably been much better since the film does not need to be 2 hours but I do not think it would have fitted in anyways. With a bit of editing I could see the last scene of El Camino being the last scene of Breaking Bad anyways as we don't need an explanation of how Jesse got there.<br/><br/>Finally, the main antagonists in the show where really boring and there was not threat about them at all. The two policemen where not old characters so we had not connection to them and instead they where basically just bad men without any character development.<br/><br/>Oh and Fat Todd was really distracting. You can't compare this with breaking bad. It didn't really have that excitement and thrill. Some scenes were actually quite boring. However, it was nice to see how Jesse ended up! And that he's basically still the same guy with some of his foolish mistakes, because of his kindness and mercifulness for people. This movie is just as amazing, maybe even more amazing as the series. It is a perfect addition to it. Could be the best movie I've ever seen. I'm giving 8 because only because it's the next of Breaking bad. Movie with pinkman without action and some idiots. It's finishing like Saul Goodman. Why in Alaska?
I expected it to go somewhere else. Maybe in Mexico!! There's nothing about 'El Camino' that's going to blow your mind about anything. It neither adds to, nor detracts from the original series. Whatever you hypothesized about Jesse's post-BB fate, this movie is not going to blow the lid off of it.
It's more like just a treat for the die-hard fans.
Mike is back, but his scene amounts to nothing. Todd, too; same results. Jane, Badger, Skinny Pete: little substance, no style.
Even Walter pops up again at one point. But just because. His brief walk-on has no effect on the narrative. He's there to appease the rabid among us, like everything else in this movie.
It is chock-full of flashbacks mostly to just beef up the runtime so it feels like a real movie. And the ultimate climax (I suppose) just seems inconsequential.
Aaron Paul delivers, though. He makes it worth one viewing. If you always wondered how Jesse would fair after breaking bad, then WATCH THIS. A masterclass. The best finale possible! Absolutely loved it! If you've watched breaking bad, watch this asap! I didn't even know how badly I wanted to see this story until I watched this. Aaron Paul is amazing. Couldn't be a better instalment in the Breaking Bad series, very satisfying. I seldom leave reviews but I had to do so for this movie. As a fan of Breaking Bad I had really high expectations, that were completely met!
The cinematography is perhaps even better than the show, and so is the acting of some of the more minor rolls. Jesse Plemons was superb again at playing a childish, but meanwhile very brutal, Todd. I was also great to see Badger and Skinny again.
I agree with other reviewers that this is Jesse's Felina.
If I have to name one downside, it felt like a second goodbye to the greatest show ever again. Breaking bad set a bar and I don't know what people are expecting from this with Walter gone but it wraps the story up well. Aaron Paul was excellent, his acting was solid. It had some interesting tense scenes and some typical breaking bad humour I love. To enjoy the film, embrace the story and don't expect a big action blockbuster and enjoy. This is a good movie, I love Aaron Paul performance, he's always the best. I really liked that now I know what happened with Jesse after his escape.
I feel happy to see that he finally scaped and lived free. But I'm a little disappointed that the movie didn't show any other characters, yeah the movie showed good tiny moments from Walter, Mike and others but personally I would like to know what happened with Walter family, did Walter Jr get the money? What happened with Marie?
Maybe in another movie.
It's a really good and close to Jessy story in the best way possible Like most other reviewers I agree that it was good but just felt it was a bit slow paced and and felt like an extended episode rather than a movie. Could have done with a bit more omphf 10/10 no but still good closure. What a fitting end to Jesse's story
The writing, acting, music, cinematography, all beautiful. Only thing is there were alot of references or moments that referred to breaking episodes that I saw years ago and so I missed some things. Pros:
Every scene has mastered tension, seriousness, creates a permanent feeling of tight fear until the end
So many great characters on their own, work extremely well when it comes to relationships
Artistic shots, I can probably point out dozens of shots that looked pretty
When the movie wants to tense it is, when it wants to be funny it is, when it wants you to feel the gravity of a scene, you do<br/><br/>Cons:
Certain actions don't reflect a character trying to be stealthy or subtle<br/><br/>Best part: Jesse and the welder testing scene, a good way to summarize 5 months of servitude and confinement
Worst part: explosion after the gunfight, a touch unnecessary and counterproductive to staying stealthy I was afraid. Yes, I was afraid that this movies could mess up a masterpiece. Instead, everything is over as it should have been: without fireworks, without twists. The right final chapter for an amazing character. Thank you, Vince Gilligan. Recently I watched the movie follow up to the TV show Deadwood and was very disappointed (I believe I wrote a detailed review on here as to why).<br/><br/>This, however, is very good. It pays homage to the original show in a much better way. This isn't a movie that's been fashioned for quick profit. It feels like a real tip of the hat to the original show and its fans. I very much enjoyed it. I felt very emotional towards the end and it's great to see some of the old characters back if even for a few seconds.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this. It is also known as the super-famous series needless to talk about. The film el camino is a living embodiment of the magnificence of the writer and I salute him from here and thank him We needed this film to discover together one of the important figures Jesse Pinkman and dive in two hours of excitement and thrill like no other. The film deserves a full mark for its beautiful addition. With Felina, Walter White had his closure. He got what he deserved. But what about Jesse? Jesse who, despite being tormented, manipulated, and toyed with by Walter, despite seeing his girlfriend die in front of him - what he later learned could have been prevented by Walter, despite having his whole life turned upside down by Walter, still stayed true to the criminal mastermind, what did he get? El Camino answers just that question, and with impeccable style.<br/><br/>Substance over style, or rather Substance but with style, is one way to describe Breaking Bad. El Camino retains the substance part, but ads a few layers of style on it. It is a strikingly beautiful film, something that was a surprise to be sure, given the quite raw cinematography of Breaking Bad, but a welcome one. With exquisite camerawork to flawless production design and unblemished editing, Vince Gilligan takes you on a deep reflecting cruise along the highway, with a few explosive stops during the way.<br/><br/>Apart from its stunning visual aspects, there are many nuanced layers of the story, that provides a greater insight into many of the shows characters, some new ones, but most of all it gives Jesse Pinkman the ending he deserves.<br/><br/>The story of Jesse's road to salvation is a suspenseful one, with almost every scene having something at stake, that is sure to keep anyone from being bored. But in the end, it all ties together as a rather beautiful drama, instead of a suspense thriller. Its greatest accomplishment is that it tells a beautiful story of a broken man on the search for salvation, something that feels quite rare these days.<br/><br/>Now what? Breaking Bad is long over, and now the whole story has come to an end. Do we just sit around and wait for Better Call Saul season five? Well yes, but let us appreciate the legend that Vince Gilligan has given us. It is a Shakespearian-esque drama that have no equal. So thank you, Vince Gilligan, for creating the most incredible visual stories. I have watched Breaking Bad 6 times, so i know each and every piece of detail from the show, and this movie is like the very last perfect piece that was left in this ART by Vince Gilligan I think more than a movie El Camino is a special episode of serie.
As a special episode El Camino is appropriate and acceptable 10/10.
As a movie there is nothing special* about it and its just a good movie 8/10.
But I guess no one watch it as a separate movie and well,because of this I pick (10/10)
------------------------------------------------------
*: I mean it isn't something unique as a movie. like BB in compare with other series. Todd shouldve lost weight for this movie like what the hell cmon lmao...
And you know it was a solid movie nothing speical really predictable but overall its a good additional bonus to the fans who love this series and want more and here we got it. It was the best ending for this incredible universe Vince Gilligan could give us. I am truly amazed by what I watched and I could not be more satisfied Any film that is made from/after a tv series is always in for a tough time.
But this film can finally put all speculation to rest about what happens next.
Personally loved the series and the way this film has ended, finally puts an end to Breaking bad. Although it's nicely filmed, and the acting is solid, I just don't think this movie really tells us anything we really want to know - it could have been a postscript to the series, and the story could have been told in 20 minutes. I was an ardent fan of "Breaking Bad" and I think after all the fanfare, this is a bit of a letdown. No spoilers as you need to make up your own mind. It felt like you watching two or three episodes of the show, the drama is similar to that in the beginning of season 5.
The directing and cinemagraphy were brilliant.
Aaron Paul's performance was epic, so was the time line, the weight and age were the most annoying thing.
Great movie for the best series ever. Paul gave remarkable performance throughout. I didn't feel like I was watching Pinkman but it didn't really matter, it has been way too long since bb came out. Vince provided great direction but it was not in the same level as the tv show. All of that is understandable. I was hoping to see all other characters including Mr. White and Saul but they were probably busy doing other shows.<br/><br/>Storyline was little predictable due to the begining dialogue but overall it was enjoyable and I was just happy to see old but familiar characters. It can be watched by anyone but Breaking Bad fans will probably appreciate it more. I swear this is the best movie in the world .
I cant belive that . its imposible oh Vince once again produces a masterpiece.
Just how far can the Breaking Bad Universe go?
Breaking bad was always gonna take some beating but I think this may have just done so. Pinkman was far from my favorite character in the show but Aaron Paul does a great job in portraying a older more seasoned Jessie Pinkman in El Camino. In classic breaking bad fashion this film is gritty, dark, humorous and tense in all the right places. In my opinion it's a perfect conclusion to one of the top tv shows to ever grace television. I love this movie and I am so happy do see that Jesse is on a new way to a new live An incredible movie that is not just a sequel. The flashbacks add greater depth to the entirety of the bb series. The pacing is brilliant also
A must watch for the true ending to jesse pinkman Beautifully written, acted and directed. Much like Breaking Bad, the visuals and small details are well cared for. There are flashbacks and forewarnings, as you would expect from Gilligan.<br/><br/>Though Breaking Bad had its moments of levity - due to the antics of Jesse or the screw ups of Walt - El Camino is void of those moments. It's sober and emotionally dark - all very much necessary to tell the story as it needs to be told.<br/><br/>The character of Todd is revealed at a more personal level and he may possibly be the most loathsome of all the BB characters.<br/><br/>Finally, Aaron Paul was just brilliant. His portrayal can only be called Jesse Pinkman 2.0 and Paul brings to this evolved character a level of emotional depth that would naturally come from the tribulations he has endured.<br/><br/>Up and down and side to side, brilliant movie. Without giving the game away, El Camino serves as quite a nice bow on the end of Breaking Bad, which though is a gamble, paid off well The best series of all time and te movie was dope, b*tch!! Very good acting and visually stunning. 10/10. What can I say? For years we've waited to find out what happened to Jesse Pinkman when he rode off in the El Camino at the end of breaking bad and now Vince Gilligan gives us the closure we needed. To say everything feels familiar is a understatement it's like a bonus two episodes of BB. Aaron Paul is amazing as he always was, there's a few of the old characters back to show their faces and *major spoiler ahead* we get treated to one final flashback scene with Walter White which got me emotional to say the least, one of the most iconic characters in film or tv on our screens for a final few minutes. It gets a 10/10 from me just like the tv show did. Seriously amazing Thats great movie I gave him 10/10
Why people say the movie was boring Awesome movie congratulations to Mr Gillian for another masterpiece!! It takes us back to the good times we met in BB .. specifically the flashbacks are so great . Good job It's a Breaking Bad movie, what did you expect?
Was definitely worth the time that Vince Gilligan and the whole cast put in it and everybody that has liked Breaking Bad will have a blast watching our favorite tv show characters on the big screen for the last time in a true Breaking Bad fashion! I was waiting for a very long time to see the fate of jesse pinkman. I watched the whole series again so i could memorize everything before watching it. And today i kept opening netflix again and again to see when it will be available. And now after finally watching it, i must say that it was a wonderful ride. The cinematography is beautiful. Aaron Paul's acting is great. It is everything i expected from a breaking bad movie and it truly feels like something directed by Vince Gilligan. The movie does feel slow but that doesn't matter because this is the pace a breaking bad movie needed. Overall, the movie is GREAT. It is not a masterpiece but i dont think it needs to be one. It is simply the journey of Jesse after everything thats happened to him. If u are a Breaking Bad fan, u will definitely love the movie. A must watch... Now it's (the story) complete. I enjoyed it allot.
Allthough fat Tod should have prepared for his part by going to the gym couple of months before shooting started. It's a slow burn but that didn't bother me at all since BB could be slow paced at times aswell. This is a very slow paced movie and there is no excitement, plot twists, great emotional moments. It gets you bored in the middle but as a fan of breaking bad you get to see most of the characters back in this movie and makes you feel really satisfied. Great, feels just like a very long breaking bad episode, excellent way to close the whole series I remember hearing Vince Gilligan say that this movie is enjoyable to someone who hasn't watched Breaking Bad, well... not really. Is it a good movie? Yes, absolutely, but it heavily relies on the watcher having watched Breaking Bad, and there is no shame in that, after all, it is called "A Breaking Bad Movie". I don't see how it adds to the story of the show, for two words are enough to summarize the whole movie: something better. It is virtually pointless, yet fun to watch, and that's enough. Obviously i spoiled myself having just watched the original for the 4th time but this contains none of the old sparkle certain people had just gotten fat and old just another movie that shouldn,t have been made leave well alone in future !!!! This movie didn't like me at all for a lot of reasons, but it looks like the director needs the money. After I waited all these days for this movie, I am super disapointed! NO great story or new big events.NOTHING creative at all...very boring ..specially that half of the movie was only remembering what has already happened! Vince ur a goddamn genius.
I'm speechless I don't know what to say.
Thank very much VINCE. I loved the series having seen it probably 5 times in it's entirety , felina the final episode for me was the perfect ending all though there were moments I wished could of been tied of towards the end , so moving on to discover a trailer to el camino I thought this would be Jessie' s moment to set things straight , like tip off the dea or walts family as to where the dea agents were buried after the desert shootout . These were the kind of things i was hoping would be told during this film but it kind of took 2hrs to tell us that Jesse escaped, which was the ending of felina anyway. So it was good to see Jesse and the others again but failed to live up to the breaking bad standards the series had set. Pretty much a money grab! No real scores settled, just a weird transition from fugitive on the run to fugitive gone into hiding. Could have been so much better but this lacked depth and to be honest it was an anti climax to what was an awesome series. My opinion though, some probably loved it! What did we watched nothing new! It's just old scenes repeated itself that's all...! One of the best movie in 2019 :
Jessy had the one of a life time experiense First half very slow and boring, second half slightly picks up but still doesnt live up to expectations.<br/><br/>Such a shame this could of be something amazing. This film start with a man "Jesse" talking with an old man, he want to retire and go to Alaska, he chase by police and taking refuge in a house with two man playing video game scene! As turnout, this film is about Jesse capture and torture by Todd and his gang, he escape and back to his house to retrieve the money he hide in a fridge to make a run to Alaska! He rob by two fake cop when he trying to retrieve the money! Entire film full of overuse TV news scene! The pacing of the film also quite slow! This film clearly is want to contend for Oscar instead of entertaining audience! Keep showing close up scene of the main actor! The conversation also very bored and not intense! Barely laughable scene is, Jesse go to a vacuum cleaner shop and ask the boss help him! The boss refuse and call the cop, Jesse opinionated the boss is faking the call! The cop arrive after the call! Barely intense scene is, Jesse went to the place of the guy who rob him, the guy challenge him a gunfight! Jesse shot him dead and shot another man on the head along the event! This scene quite bloody! And have some glass broken! He eventually burn down the place by leaking the gas! El Camino actually is the car name! And this film not even about a car! Ridiculous! At the end, Jesse eating with Walt at the restaurant! Ed borrow his truck to Jesse to go to Alaska! That's it! Deceive by the action genre to watch it! Turnout it's completely letdown! Not recommended! Netflix come out with the worst movies ever. They make movies to make movies. No quality at allnin their movies. What we got here is the screenplay turned Jesse Pinkman into a wimp, a wanker, lamer, a nervous breakdown wreck, couldn't control his fragile emotion and kept crying. There were two times that he got the guns, but he just returned them to the owners. What can I say, man. If you can't walk the walk, then don't talk the talk. being a nervous wreck was just too pathetic to watch. He wrecked the whole apartment like an amateur handyman trying to do a fix-upper remodeling job. This crying baby is so pathetic to watch. A horrible appendix totally unnecessarily and purposelessly tried in vain to hook up the "Breaking Bad" TV series. Wasted mucho $$$ that actually could do some good for animal shelters. What a pity, man. I do hear Jesus cried on his crutches, sharing tears with this Jesse wimp. It's like the mediocre writing of Breaking Bad; flashes of greatness interspersed with illogical characters, bad writing and dropped story lines and conclusions.
The flashes are what wasted several seasons of my life, hoping it would settle down and get better and if i had spent that time day trading instead of watching TV, I'd be much richer now.
If you're expecting a good story line and answers to questions, fah ged abowt it! Not as good as i would have expected but on the other hand not at all terrible. Recommended if you have watched the Breaking Bad series. Lighting was bad and the cast looked like they were fed up of the series. Production looked like it was made by 2 year olds and the setting was completely off. Terrible plot without a climax. Very disappointing overall A great film - much in the spirt of BB! Give me a break you not- pickers! It can stand on its own and the same great filming, dark dialogue and themes are greatly interwoven!! I hope they do more sequels! I hate giving the rating that I'm giving but I want to be honest instead of giving it a 10 because it's Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is such a classic series and truly feel that it will age wonderfully because it's just that damn good on all levels. It was a series that truly left you on the edge of your seat because you kept wondering what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>I mentioned BCS in my header because I tried to give BCS a chance. I enjoyed the Saul and Mike characters on BB so I followed them to the prequel series. And overall I was disappointed in what I saw. I sat through an entire season so it wasn't like I watched for 5 minutes and flipped away. I realized even before I watched BCS that the pacing will be completely different than on BB. And that didn't strike me as being a problem. One of my favorite shows is "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and the pacing on that show is average. You have an interesting story line taking shape before your eyes and it keeps you interested throughout the whole episode. BCS became a problem when the pacing is too slow. You're sitting through the episode while waiting for something to happen because nothing's happening. When the first season ended I debated on trying the second season and decided against it. I will forever enjoy Saul and Mike on Breaking Bad but Better Call Saul just isn't the show for me.<br/><br/>I felt like El Camino followed in that same 'too slow' pacing that BCS has going for it. I kept touching the screen and wondering "Is it about off yet? geez, still has x amount of time to go." Overall I was disappointed in the movie and more than likely won't watch it again. The following items I enjoyed about EC:<br/><br/>1. It is nice to see certain cast members again. I realize there's gonna be a lot of criticism because this is supposed to take place immediately after BB wrapped up and certain people have changed during the years from the finale of BB to the shooting of this movie. I can ignore aging and stuff like weight gain. That didn't bother me.I realize stuff like that can't be controlled so it's not a big deal.<br/><br/>2. I enjoyed Badger and Skinny Pete's scenes at the beginning. They were truly the highlight of the movie for me.<br/><br/>3. It's nice that it looks like Jesse might be able to be happy/at peace in Alaska. I'm glad he got a happy ending when so many BB characters truly didn't. The one thing that I did notice in this movie was no one really says Walter White is dead. That is the best take away I got from this movie. It's still possible and gives me hope for what we all ultimately want, a new Breaking Bad series! The movie didn't deliver anything new. It could've been much better if it delivered Jesse's farewell in another way. Such a disappointment. Being a breaking bad fan boy I had large expectation on this one ..but there seemed to be no point in making this .<br/><br/>the ending of BB was perfect ..it was kind of open enough and left many things to our imagination ..
even the death of Walter was not confirmed (as Bryan himself told in an interview later ) .<br/><br/>There was nothing new in El Camino..it was boring and doesn't even deserve to be an episode of BB . The story would fit into 15 minutes.
Jesse got away in the El Camino (we saw that in the last episode of BB).
From there we get mostly flashbacks what happened while Jesse was in captivity.
Poorly written and not relevant to the rest of the story of BB.
There's no unexpected plot-twist, no secrets revealed, just... nothing!
Jesse got away, in this film he got even "more away".
Boring, unnecessary, not relevant.
If the last episode of BB would have been 15 minutes longer, this story perfectly could have been told in that time. I wasn't sure what to expect from this film and thought it might be OTT and best avoided but I was pleasantly surprised. It's understated and measured and a great watch if you were invested in Jesse and Breaking Bad. I thought it was brilliantly done - subtle, tense and well acted. Would definitely recommend. We wanted to know what happened to Jesse. We got it. More of the same? Absolutely. Great. Give me more. It's what I want. If your looking for a new tv show. Watch one. This ties everything I hoped for up. I like the ending after so much things breaking bad. Nice try. Not at all what I expected and I couldn't finish it. Too dark, too much focus on torturing a human being and enjoying it. Horrible to watch, not my kind of entertainment. I don't understand why the writers choose this story line to follow from what they had to work with from the series. Too bad really. Six years after Breaking Bad's finale 'Felina' aired we are gifted with 'El Camino' - the perfect ending to Jesse Pinkman's story. Many see him screaming in the El Camino without a care in the world in 'Felina' to be a beautiful poetic ending- myself included. That's why when El Camino was revealed, I set very minimal expectations- asking 'what else do they need to tell us?' But oh my- this movie was beautiful. A slow paced film that captures the essence of Jesse Pinkman at his core, flashbacks that provide the narrative with an effortless structure that works. Aaron Paul with another award worthy performance as Jesse, what else could you ask for? I can't stress how much you have to watch this film, it is a perfect example of how cinematography, sound mixing, narrative and performance can work perfectly together. Nothing is short in 'El Camino' - I finished it satisfied and so happy! 'El Camino' is sublime. This movie should never have been released. It's one thing to have a bad episode in an otherwise epic series but these 2 hours were a disgrace to the good name of BB. The pace is ridiculously slow and absolutely nothing happens.<br/><br/>I'm only giving it a 2 instead of a zero because Aaron Pauls portrayal of the haunted and intense Jesse was good as always.<br/><br/>Apart from that, a pure waste of time. No closure needed but this film achieves nothing apart from getting to see some of the main characters again. Not sure what the director was thinking here. Given the backstory, that Jesse is simply allowed to stumble into he sunset per the finale would have been enough. El Camino has Jesse kind of quickly recovering, with some nods to PTSD, but then launched into regular Breaking Bad problem solving as if this is just a longer episode. Seems like such a lapse in judgement to get this thing produced, save for Jesse Plemons playing an amazing socio-path and the always great Aaron Paul. Like many here, I'm left asking why we need to explore the internal despair of someone so completely destroyed, he has almost been killed numerous times, betrayed often, with two girlfriends murdered, as well as other friends, kidnapped, tortured with the constant threat of being murdered and he is an actual murderer. I suppose people get into the scene by scene artistry here, Gilligan is always great but jeez, enough. Better call Saul was a far better tribute to Breaking bad, indeed, in my opinion, a better show as I really soured on the fortunes of Walter White after the planes collided in mid-air (can't get much worse than that). And to be clear, the finale was awful good, what went before, not so much, but not much more to be said,and for you, dear viewer, not much more to be watched. I don't know what this was supposed to be.
Was it a primer for an upcoming new series in Alaska or was it just that someone had some spare cash left over from the last series and it was burning a hole in their pocket?<br/><br/>You've got to give a few marks for the scenery in New Mexico and the teaser scenery in Alaska but that's about all there is in this disjointed waste of time.<br/><br/>You have to keep notes to keep up with the storyline and woe betide you if you get up and go to the fridge. If you do you'll have lost the plot completely and you'll have to go to Wikipedia to fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>Jonathan Banks makes a cameo appearance confirming that he's not even "one dimensional" and the rest of the cast is portrayed as inscrutable , expressionless villains.<br/><br/>In the end I realized that it is more than likely a setup for a new series based in Sarah Palin's back yard, probably because the government of New Mexico wants too much in the way of fees .<br/><br/>If this is the case then all is not lost. The director, Vince Gilligan, is a very talented guy and I'm sure he can come up with a riveting series from Alaska. After all you've got wildlife and snow to throw in the mix, along with Palin's family.... that could be a series on its own. You've also got a border without a wall up there and the Ruskies on your doorstep.
(at least that's what the aforementioned Palin used to tell us)<br/><br/>So, look at this movie in that sort of light and you'll enjoy it, not for the performances or the story, but more for the anticipation of what might come. The film depondes on the series reputation only there is no suspense no morale low acting performance it wasted my time I went in to this movie with really lukewarm expectations. The reviews I have read gave it 6's and 7' as good but nothing special. Well for me it was like seeing old friends who I love again after some years of absence. Vince Gilligan's writing and direction were flawless. How he told the story of Jessie interwoven with all the back story from the last episode was perfect. Seeing Walter White and Jessie almost brought a tear to my eye. Jessie calling him Mr. White at the diner then you realize the road they travel and devastation they cause. The referral to Lydia dying in the hospital thanks to Mr. White. Jessie Pleamons was such a sociopath as Todd his dialogue fits him to a T. So in closing this was Jessie's story and it was done as great as Breaking Bad was, a classic show written by a genius. Goes all the way back to X Files. It's always great to see old friends you love. Thank you. Alls I can say is, this film is boring and no where near as good as breaking bad. Nothing really happens in it and the story is boring. This movie is everything that a breaking bad fan could have hoped for, and more! It exceeds all expectations and is better than you could have wanted or imagined.<br/><br/>I was so curious as to what the theme of this movie was going to be. I knew it was going to be about Jesse on the run after the show. But we've all seen action movies about criminals on the run before, how were they going to make this unique and special and hook us emotionally and get us engaged and invested?<br/><br/>The answer is by having Jesse on a journey to freedom (which in itself is already emotionally engrossing), and all the while remembering emotionally significant times he had with all of your favorite characters from the show. Every flashback he has will make you lean forward in your seat. Its genius!<br/><br/>This movie is so well done, not just with the story and the delivery of it through the acting, but with the cinematography and directing as well. For a breaking bad fan, it is a work of art, a true masterpiece. I give it a ten out of ten.<br/><br/>The only disappointment was that there was no appearance of Gus Fring. But I wasn't sure whether to expect that or not. And its not like there is anything wrong with the movie even though that didn't happen. Just don't expect it. Didn't have high expectations, because you can't continue a perfect ending, but this movie seems to be a movie made for the Breaking Bad show fans. It has a lot of flashbacks, some good action, but it ends the same way as the other ending: Jesse free. It was good to see Pinkman and Walt again, and some of the other characters, and in the end it got me feeling like: damn, this is the end of this(just like the tv show). I was eager to see better than that breaking masterpiece The reviews warning about "fan boys" are irrelevant. El Camino is actually a warranted story about what happened to pinkman. It's good to have that closure of the series.<br/><br/>To be honest all through this you just want to watch breaking bad all over again. I liked having this film to finish it Not much to say really to be honest 2 hours of dragging, to see Jessie drive away, shame the wasn't anything about Walter white or any other characters ie Walt jr or skylar, give it 5star not going to miss much If u dont watch it, series is 10 star tho This was an incredible movie, and I really enjoyed watching Pinkman's closure. We don't know what he is going to be doing in Alaska, but nobody has ever been kicked harder in the nuts than Jesse Pinkman in film. He was a slave, his parents gave up on him (even though his parents were also victims), all his girl friends died. He finally got to start over, he can live in the wilderness for years and hopefully nobody will ever recognize him. Pinkman obviously wasn't a saint, cooking meth at the levels he did, he deserved to go to prison for the rest of his life, but his character in film made viewers feel that wouldn't be just. It reminds me of Tony Soprano, where he was a ruthless killer mob boss, but the series made people actually like someone who is basically evil. Before I start to criticize the movie I want to say some good things about it. first of all Jesse's character, his actions and decisions after the Breakout are realistic and believable (except for some scenes which I will mention later) cinematography is very good, (different but good) the flashback scenes are well written, and the performances are outstanding.<br/><br/>El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is not loyal to the series. it's like a whole other thing which individually is pretty good but when you consider it as a Breaking Bad movie it just doesn't fit.
The cinematography is different (like I said before, good but different), camera movements are different and honestly it doesn't feel like Breaking Bad. it doesn't go under the character's skin and doesn't show us what he's going through which is kinda the reason why Breaking Bad was so good. some of the scenes just seem ridiculous like that duel scene (don't worry, not gonna spoil anything), where suddenly Jesse turns to John Wayne, and the dialogues are so unrealistic."like in the wild west?".
the scene with Walter White is one of the best scenes in the movie but it kinda ruins the perfectness of his last moments in our minds, I liked it better when the last Walter White on the screen was smile up to me, and not coughing in some restaurant. the same thing goes for mike.
and the most disappointing thing, the ending. it's unrealistic and trying too hard to be hopeful and optimistic. It's hard to make a breaking bad movie when the show was perfectly crafted. It almost feels like the directors cut this from the end of the breaking bad show. There isn't a real strong climax to it all, which I personally don't mind but I'm not sure if the movie could stand on its own outside of watching the TV show. I'm also kinda surprised of how little Walt was used in flashbacks. Regardless it was enjoyable. I didn't complete watching the whole series because it was just too dark. This was an interesting wrapup and I would imagine most diehard fans appreciated it. I have no complaints about it. Vince Gilligan once again delivers a finale that is both provoking and satisfying. An incredible homage to the series that hones in on what made the show so great. It is a tribute to the excellent writing and story telling of the Breaking Bad series that makes the audience want more, but still be content with the hope it provides. Not once, but twice, Gilligan creates a conclusion worthy of the performances in the show. It's good, just not 2 hours worth of good.<br/><br/>The story follows the efforts of Jesse immediately after the last scene of Breaking Bad as he tries to get out of the country and start a new life. The film tries very hard to ramp up tension in several set pieces, but you never feel as if there's any real jeopardy, no 'edge of my seat' moments such as we were swamped with in the original series. It all feels more like a quest movie; Jesse has to find an item, then he has to find a character who sets him onto another quest. There are conflicts, but none feel like he's going to lose.<br/><br/>Many original cast members appear in flashback scenes, none of which do anything to propel the story, with one exception.<br/><br/>If it were cut to 60 minutes, it might still feel slow, but at least you've only wasted an hour. It was a masterpiece. One of the best stories I've ever seen. Incredible acting!!! Amazing camerawork!! Thank you for this Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul! It made me tear up a few times but also made me feel really good too! I'm sad that it's over. You just couldn't ask for more. It's brilliant. It adds more context and background to the TV Show and has a lot of nice throwbacks/parallels/easter eggs. It's a chill movie for true fans. It has no unrealistic events (like Walter being alive) for more "hype and action". Breaking Bad is already finished and it doesn't need more than this kind of movie, it would even hurt the already happened climax of the show.
I can understand people who are disappointed, but this is not the fault of the writers (Vince Gilligan is a god). This is your own fault by expecting something that makes no sense or would hurt the show.<br/><br/>Only one thing I didn't like while watching was the look of some cast members in the flashbacks which just don't look like their TV show appearance. I think you could have put a bit more money in this project to make them look like their show appearance. We know this is already possible nowadays.<br/><br/>However this movie is truly amazing. I've watched it 2 times since now and I'm not tired of watching it again and again and again. I was worried this was being made for the sake of it, for them to make some extra cash on the back of a show I have loved so much.
I was wrong! If you loved breaking bad for the charecters then you will love this. If you only loved it for the action then you may be disappointed.
The story is solid and gives us a final ending for Jesse that we all wish we knew when the credits rolled at the end of season 5. A big disappointment but overall its Satisfactory End.
Technically it is not a movie, it is 63rd episode of breaking bad which quite lengthy then usual.
As everybody saw in trailer, Jesse (Aron paul) asked some help from Skinny (Charles baker) and badger (Matt Jones), they helped him best, then a flashback starts and Jesse start searching for the money which todd (Jesse) hides in hit condo.
That's it.
In between them, there are couple or may be thrice flashbacks, a few gun shots and lots of emotions.
But, if you are seeking for some unsolved puzzles like where the hell of the 69M money? what happened to the white family? Did grey matter donates that 9M or not? then you would be empty hand in the end.<br/><br/>Again, it is a satisfactory ending but it wasn't much necessary. We all could imagine that. There's nothing special in it.<br/><br/>Vince said once "He can't recreate the breaking bad again, even if he want to"
You said it correct.<br/><br/>One more thing I get and probably you also find that odd, Jesse is an awesome character but without walter white, it's barely enjoyable. It is almost nothing.<br/><br/>But, Aron Paul acted very very well. An award winning performance but except him, nobody is on the mark. Jesse Plemons looked fatty. Matt Jones also looked like a man instead of a young boy. Kristen Ritter looked aged.
Trying to say that all those flash back characters were missed their continuity except Bryan Cranston and Jonathan banks (Probably they are already too old, their face would not change in even after decade)<br/><br/>Overall it is a one time watch but only for those who are / were connected with breaking bad saga. This movie was such a thing that gets you back the days you were watching Breaking Bad. While Jesse and Walt were eating in the cafe, the air was amazing. The scenes that Jesse and Todd are making conversation each other, make you remember that days. Finally, at least I have just relaxed to learn the rest of the story. Therefore, everything that Aaron Paul has a role in and written by Vince Giligan is excellent and "Breaking Bad" definition as a brand new compliment. This film was such a Breaking Bad! Beautiful with all the latest
Beautiful connects the past to the present
Beautiful music
Beautiful with beautiful photography with everything
My rating is 1000/10 Vince Gilligan has just shown us what we do not see usually on a movie, those long shots, those long emotions on a scene, those long moments where people just connect with the character.
Is it a perfect movie ? no yet I am going to give it 10 as it is a perfect ending one can expect from Breaking bad characters.<br/><br/>You will feel nostalgic when you will reunite with all the characters you have loved for the last 11 years. The conversations will make you think not only about the characters but also about the meaning they have in a regular life.<br/><br/>I am not going to write about directing, screenplay, acting or music as it is not about that, it is about the goodbye.<br/><br/>Thanks Vince Gilligan. I really believe that whatever they do with breaking bad is fine, Vince Gilligan demonstrates that he can continue to exploit the universe as much as he wants and will always do something of a really admirable quality. This film simply cannot help but make you feel so sorry for Jesse, you hate him for turning against Walt in BB even though he's totally justified in doing so. The film showcases a lot of the psychological abuse he suffered in the hands of Todd and Jack's gang, he even had an opportunity to kill Todd before and escape the end of the series, but was so broken he just couldn't do it. This film just shows you how much people want to survive and live and the lengths they will go to. The scene where Jesse goes back to the fabricators who made his shackles in the lab was simply amazing, it was almost a Heisenberg moment and Jesse thoroughly deserved what he got from it.<br/><br/>The addition of Skinny Pete and Badger were great too, showing the compassion we have for our friends and especially ones that are in a tough spot, simply brilliant acting throughout.<br/><br/>I would've given it a 10, but sometimes the pacing was a bit off but that's just me nit picking and doesn't take anything away from this masterpiece. Breaking Bad was an incredible show that played against the rules of traditional Tv storytelling. Vince Gilligan has once again managed to continue the Breaking Bad universe with Better Call Saul and now El Camino. El Camino helps answer the question everybody wanted to know and this extension of the show is essential and relevant. This is a strong movie and well developed, hopefully the success and popularity entices Netflix to expand. Worth every minute and Gilligan clearly loves every beat of this film. I expected more , so disappointed. It's just 2 more episodes of breaking bad. Good acting, great cinematography, solid directing.... but still, comparing to the series.... it can't hold it's candle. A good wrap for Jesse Pinkman but that's it. The movie doesn't live up to its hype. Nothing special. Great job. Truly just a great job all around giving all of Breaking Bad addicts one last hit of that Heisenberg/Cap'N-Cook/Badger/Skinny Pete.. Blue plate special! Hahaha Lovedd this soo much! Gave me the peace of mind I needed. And I'm sure many others. Well Jesse you go make the last frontier your playground my friend! Hope you are happy because I know I am after seeing El Camino. GL & Happy Trails to all of you fanatics just like me! It wasn't on the same level of Breaking Bad, but we call it a good movie.
Or a great deserving closure to Jesse Pinkman. Seems its bit interesting for the people who watched the Tv series ,as they know all about the old characters but for new audiences its its nothing interesting, so i gave 10/10 to show but this movie is not as great so cutting the 4 point. So great!<br/><br/>You could say this is an unnecessary follow-up, but I believe 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' is an excellent add-on to the television show.<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan, as I expected, hits it out the park with this. Aaron Paul does too, it's a joy to see him reprise the role of Jesse Pinkman - he's brilliant. Jesse Plemons is terrific here, he fully commits to Todd with a quality performance.<br/><br/>The only criticism of this is the lack of continuity on how the characters look six years on, especially for Jesse and Todd. That's only a minor detail though, as the acting remains top notch.<br/><br/>I like the premise, the stuff with Kandy's crew is a little less interesting than the stuff with Pete, Badger, Mike etc. Not to say the former is dull, far from it - the complete opposite in fact.<br/><br/>I will say it's probably only worth viewing if you've seen 'Breaking Bad' itself, as it'll make for a fantastic watch if you have. BB was one of the best series of all time and to make a movie that has no pulse I'm really surprised. I really can't stand Jesse Plemmons character, come to think of it I really don't care for him period as an actor so to spend so much time with his character was a complete waste in my opinion. This movie could have been so much more, the slate was completely open for any and all possibilities but the step was never taken in that direction instead we're left with boring flash backs and a so so present story. Actually yes it is just like sixth season of BB. However it took me into last part of story( it may not! ) and i think this is the most important matter about this movie. So Breaking Bad did not finish in S5/E16, okay Walter's story is done but Jesse's is not! Then they finished the story of Jesse El Camino too. Exactly there are some problem about production but this movie deserves 9 points to me. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I knew I would like it, but I didn't think I'd be as engrossed as I was. I think it goes beyond merely fan service and closure, and actually functions as a more meaningful postscript for the Breaking Bad universe than a film with a goofy title starring maybe the most polarizing major character from that universe should have any right doing. Personally, I forgot just how bleak the arc of Jessie really got in that final B.B. season. My goodness, he went through some stuff! (To say the least.) This movie provides a nice mix of flashbacks (most notably with the scene-stealing Todd performance of Jesse Plemons) and new plot points. Vince Gilligan hits all the beats of a good episode that never gets old over the stretch to a two-hour feature. And sure, the one flashback towards the end with you-know-who maybe didn't fully work for various reasons, but it was still a lot of fun to watch. There isn't really a reason to critique this outside of the realm of Breaking Bad fans because what crazy person is watching this as its own thing? I have no idea if it's a good movie fully on its own merit, but it's a good and welcome addition to the previously TV-exclusive universe. This would have been a much more enjoyable film if the ending had not been given away by the first two minutes when Jesse is talking to his friend.
My advice is skip this and I think you'll like the film more. Shows the horrible abuse Jesse went thru , but the star of this is Jessie Plemons who nailed his role to perfection Jesse and I will be there at the same time I don't have a car so I can get a ride to the airport on Friday and I will be there at the same time El Camino is a 2019 Netflix original film which picks up exactly where the storyline of Breaking Bad left off. Breaking Bad was a hit TV show airing on AMC from 2008-2013, which won several accolades, critics' praises, and wide commercial appeal. After the disappointing finale to Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad is arguably the greatest TV show of this era. So a sendoff movie was made to give Jesse Pinkman's story a nice little bow on top. Creator Vince Gilligan said in an interview that he would not have made this film if it were not for the success of Better Call Saul - the prequel to Breaking Bad centering on the origins of the sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman. It makes one ponder that did Vince Gilligan really need to make this piece for a proper sendoff for Jesse, or does he have ulterior motives like making money for Netflix, and getting more exposure for Breaking Bad, and its spinoffs.<br/><br/>It's interesting to point out that the ending of Breaking Bad and El Camino are similar in their regard to Jesse. In both versions, Jesse is seen driving off into a new life awaiting him. Breaking Bad did not end with a crazy cliffhanger for Jesse; plus a lot after his departure is left for viewers' imagination. With the addition of El Camino, viewers will not have to use their imaginations as everything is laid out for them. El Camino doesn't answer any large looming questions. It just shows what Jesse does and what skills he utilizes to get out of tricky situations. However, it does provide more character development in the form of flashbacks for Walt, Mike, Jesse, and even the despicable Todd. It also delivers on things we loved in Breaking Bad such as: intense confrontations, nerve-racking situations, badassery, and intelligent plotting. In other words, the addition of this film to the Breaking Bad cannon is welcome, due to its faithfulness to Breaking Bad style and continuity, but it does not really add anything new. Breaking Bad ended just fine on its own. Everything Jesse does and accomplishes in this movie, is pretty much how we left him at the end of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>El Camino provided more character depth, entertaining confrontations, badass moments, and nostalgia for the glory days of Breaking Bad. El Camino did a good job of carrying on the Breaking Bad spirit. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad, then you will like El Camino. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, you should make plans to watch Breaking Bad immediately, and then go watch this movie. There were so many themes, plot lines, and characters this movie could have pursued and it chose to mostly ignore all of them. Instead of exploring characters such as Walt's wife and son, his sister-in-law, Jesse's murdered girlfriend's son, or the poisoned Lydia to name a few it spent an extensive amount of boring and senseless flashback time exploring Jesse's time when held captive and his interactions with an extremely overweight psychotic Todd. Plot lines such as the missing 10 barrels of money or the friends of Walt who were entrusted with money for Walt's son were ignored. Time filling cameos by Jonathan Banks and Bryan Cranston were embarrassing and downright nonsensical. I know this was a movie that was supposed to be about Jesse but it could have been so much more. Like I said a total disappointment. On the plus side Paul's acting was superb but was not nearly enough to lift this movie above mediocrity. I thought this movie was a gem, I watched it recently and it is just as action packed and adventurous as Breaking Bad, it' the best closure for Jesse that I think many can relate to but there is one thing that I thought would make it better.<br/><br/>I felt that Jesse, as Mike had wanted to do, moved to Northern America. I feel that Jesse felt forced to go to there.<br/><br/>A better place, in my opinion, for Jesse I think would be if he moved to New Zeland, where both Jane and Jesse wanted to go and both agreed that would be the best place. Things I liked:
1. Jesse grew a set and was more mature. He was no longer the weak, cowardice, head case he was at times during the series.
2 Skinny Pete and Badger's characters were developed further and were a lot of fun.
3. We got to look inside of Todd's warped mind. He was a complete psychopath and a great villain.
4. Great to see a lot of the old cast.
Things I didn't like:
1. Too much filler, too much time with the extractor character and too much time with Todd.
2. Todd was too fat, should of trimmed down for the movie. It was hard to see him as the same guy.
3. Just one meaningless scene with Walter.
4. No Skyler, Walt Jr, Saul? What happened to them?
Overall, good but not great movie that could have been so much better IMO. That scene with Mike and Jessie right by the lake was never shown to the series and it is not implied to the story timeline. Either the writer wanna told a story where Mike and Jessie lived that moment like a happily end or its just a mistaken scene just to give Mike some air time.<br/><br/>Any suggestions welcomed Epic ending but wish it's more. Since after the sad ending drama it could be a happy ending too but it was a relief. I m a big fan of the original series and it was one the best I have watched. It should be end up like this as if we put more into it we don't feel the same that we felt about the series and that won't be a epic climax and we won't be missing it. El Camino was a very good ending to Jessie's story. It was the toy story 4 of breaking bad. We didn't necessarily want it, but we needed it. BB ended in a great way. But Jessie's story could have had a better conclusion. And this was that conclusion. It was a little slow in the middle but you still never know where it's going, and in a good way. Lots of great suprises throughout. Essential viewing for BB fans. There is nothing new in this movie. It was kind of boring at point. I think it was a movie just to stop speculation about Jesse Pinkman's future. But the ending was the same as breaking bad, when Jesse with his new identity drives off to Alaska. The story was bland. This movie wasn't what I want, but it was a good movie.
After Breaking Bad Series, I'd like to find out how Jesse's life will go on!
This movie was a part of it and I will watch any sequel! This film is great, however having just re watched season 4 and 5 before watching this, and seeing this as a continuation, Todd has not aged well at all. You would think the creators would have given Jesse Plemons the heads up to loose some weight to make him look believable, just a little bit of a distraction unfortunately. On the whole, this spawn Breaking Bad was entertaining but not in a league with its parent (unlike Better Call Saul, which is even better than Breaking Bad). Where to begin? Don't bother to watch the recap; it's just a few minutes of disjointed outtakes from the original series, not a lead-in to the situation with which the movie opens. Unless you have an excellent memory for such things -- or just finished watching Breaking Bad -- you won't know why Jesse finds himself where he does, and you'll never learn. Characters from Breaking Bad are recycled, but their past relationship to Jesse is never made clear. There are a lot of back-and-forth time jumps that interrupt the main flow of action. After a lot of sound and fury there's a limp ending, which has the feel of a setup for another sequel. I'll pass. Aaron Paul gives a stellar performance in this classic Vince Gilligan tale. I loved going back inside the BB story and getting some closure on the criminal (but still lovable) Jesse Pinkman. If you are expecting a blockbuster movie, it isnt that. The movie simply felt like an extended episode, a second part to the original finale, centered on jesse and his struggle to find freedom and resolution. If you are a fan of the show you will enjoy el caminos provided that you can manage your expectations. The original finale left Jesse's story arc lacking, and this movie corrected that shortcoming for me completely. In all honesty I didn't want this film to happen as it didn't want it to tarnish the amazing Breaking Bad. So when it was, I had 0 expectations.<br/><br/>It's good, seen a few people whine about it and I have no idea why. It was a fitting end to the Jesse Pinkman storyline. I didn't feel like it dragged out and in all honesty it worked well as a film.<br/><br/>Only problem was that I hadn't seen breaking bad in a while now so a couple of characters and references I had to think real hard about it. But it's definitely worth watching if you enjoyed breaking bad. You got to see a great character in Jesse in this 2 hours and I feel the ending of this movie was perfect in terms of how you'd want it to end.<br/><br/>8/10. It was the film I didn't know I needed. But did. It shows you what happend with jesse after the events of Breaking Bad, and it closes the series as well.
its like another episode but totally dedicated to Jesse's future.
fans will enjoy it. My first mistake was going into this film with EXTREMELY high expectations. But after six years since the Breaking Bad finale, this was the best Vince Gillian could do? El Camino introduces new characters we don't need while completely forgetting fan-favorite originals -- I'm being generous as this IS an addendum to Breaking Bad, arguably the greatest TV series of all time. It was ok but nowhere near as good as Breaking Bad. It leaves a lot of unanswered questions. How do they make a movie 6 years after Breaking Bad's last episode and expect people to remember what happened? The movie seemed ok but then it just ended and we were wondering if Part 2 was going to begin. It couldn't have been the same writers. I loved this movie. I know some people say it's "irrelevant" and "unnecessary", but I needed closure on Jesse. The character development was too good in breaking bad to not have complete closure, the mystery didn't work for me. Him driving off in the finale was great, but we knew cops were coming and we didn't know if he'd be ok. He went through all the torture to get a mystery ending? Heck no. Vince Gilligan did right by Jesse in making this movie. The only thing I wish the movie had was some status check on skylar and Walt JR, maybe just a throwaway line on the news about skylar being arrested would've been awesome. Overall I give this a 9/10 and will gladly re watch the show and the movie. Lenny Kravitz knew best ... Music reference aside, this movie continues from where Breaking Bad left us. So suffice to say that this was made for fans of the show. And I will assume that you have seen the TV show, therefor do not read on, if you haven't.<br/><br/>The very last episode of Breaking Bad seemed to round things up. Almost all loose ends were tight up. Especially when it came to Walter White. And what was Breaking Bad if not a show about a teacher who became this bigger than life villain? Well Aaron Paul had something to say about that. And since his character had something to offer us still ... the creator of Breaking Bad felt he could satisfy the need from fans to have more.<br/><br/>And for fans the movie is filled with little pieces of callbacks and nice references. Not to mention some flashbacks with some of our favorite characters (to hate). So yes I do understand if some feel this undermines the end of the actual TV show, but that would be missing the bigger picture (no pun intended). Yes there was not an absolute need for this movie, but what it does is expanding on the ending and giving us something that transcends the TV show and may even elevate it - not to mention get many people to rewatch the original series ... even more so than Better call Saul made them do it (a show I haven't watched yet) ... Jesse breaking bad for a last time before he breaks free to live a good life.
I expected to see more characters and Walt's family and some kind of general aftermath. Instead it was just a movie to show that Jesse got away and that's that. Nothing more. Overall it was wonderful to see another breaking bad "episode" as that's what this was. It's basically just the 12 hours following the last episode plus a LOT of flashbacks. Was great to see the characters, but Walt just died and we don't get to see Skylar, Marie, Walt Jr., etc. Since those people clearly didn't want to come back for this film, maybe it would have been best to go with a more broad timeline. In the current one, it feels imperative to see how the fam is doing after getting Hank's burial site and Walt's death. Last night after watching this I gave it a 7. Today after thinking about it more it has dropped to a 5. It doesn't sit well with you. This 5 is generous because Jesse is my favorite, but he just mopes and groans and moans. Netflix clearly just threw a bunch of money at Vince Gilligan and he said "ehhh whatever I'll do it." I think I wouldn't be wrong if I said that Vince Gillian loves Jesse, so he would never end his story with some bloody mess in Breaking Bad style. Jesse got way too much for a single person. He was lost, abandoned, forgotten, broken so many times, and even if he grabbed a sudden straw, Walter would push him back to the water every damn time. So Jesse deserved his second chance. Sure, the movie wasn't even nearly as brutal as the show, but this is a good relief and farewell. He survived the storm and he got his second chance. I'm happy with Gillian's answer, and wouldn't want more. A bit slow paced, but nice cinematography. Sometimes you wonder how Jesse still keeps doing things in such a stupid way; you can't help but blame the guy for his own faults. It's keeping in character with BrBa though. It actually hurts me to see nice and sympathetic Jesse with scars on his face. It's easy to feel for the guy and even though he did 'bad' things, you still think he deserves a happy ending.
Did anyone else find there's a lingering homo-eroticism throughout the entire film? It kept me own my toes, I found it a little unsettling at times.
Do watch if you're a BrBa fan, I think BrBa is one of the best series ever and enjoyed this movie as well. Another excellent spin off from the Breaking Bad saga, not quite up there with Better Call tv series but entertaining all the same.
It's unfortunate that all the really interesting characters are dead or have disappeared.
Good story and the outcome was satisfying
It puts an end to all those " I wonder what happened to Jess" questions Watching this movie gives everyone the closure they wanted for Jesse. It plays like 2 extra episodes of the original show and doesn't skip a beat or make you feel like you're watching something different. It doesn't really add or take anything away from the show but for those fans that are passionate about the series, it is worth the watch and a solid film. Seriously dudes, this seemed more like an episode of Breaking Bad than a movie. That means it's not bad, but it just tells us what happen to Jesse in the one week after Walter White died. Why did I need to know this? I mean I already knew Jesse escaped and would've left the country or something. But I wanted to know where he ended up and what was he doing. Did he get a job? Did he start cooking meth for money again? I did not need to know that he found the minivan guy or looted Todd.<br/><br/>It's been six years since the series finale. I wanted to gosh darn it know what was happening six years after he escaped and not the one week after he escaped. Is that too much to ask for a movie?<br/><br/>Vince Giligan already told us this back after the series finale interviews that Jesse's escape represented hope and wanted hope to live on.<br/><br/>I did not watch the trailer for this movie because I didn't want anything given away or spoiled for me. I was excited about it. We finally learn what happened to Jesse Pinkman. Yay!<br/><br/>And to top it off, the movie title El Camino, which is a car, only appears for around 5 minutes exact except for flashbacks which you can confirm on your own. I thought this car would play an essential role in him doing his everyday job or helping him in running from the law. It's no part of a plot device. Jesse just leaves the car at his friend's home and gets away in another car. 5 minutes total.<br/><br/>So as a Breaking Bad episode I would give it 10/10. As a movie 6/10. I've been reading other reviews and basically all of them are saying it felt like two episode of Breaking Bad than an actual movie. Well two episodes of BB is still better than the last two episodes of GOT (Game of Thrones). Another one of those films you didn't really know you wanted; untill you saw it. I personally had no issue with Jesse's open ending in Breaking Bad's original run. Yet, this film really tied up some loose ends. And it tied them beautifully. Great acting, interesting structure, God-tier soundtrack: the elements we love about BrBa are again displayed in this film.<br/><br/>I hope this means the BrBa timeline can finally be put to rest. In my eyes that particular story is concluded. Untill Gilligan writes another addition to it ... probably. There is a sad tone to the show that persists post escape for Jesse , you feel for his character as some of the retrospectives remind us of the arduous March he has been on and the trail of blood and tears. The 4k capture and presentation are similar to the main show. Unlike other movies where ones escape to a new life if rewarded with riches Jesse's 410k is just enough to start a new but not nearly adequate for the years of hell. You feel like there is no way it was worth it which i admit left me a bit sad at the end. Well acted and cleverly cut and wrote. Although I loved the breaking bad TV show. I always felt we never got the closure we needed for Jessie who was pretty much a main character with Walt.
We knew Walt had died, but all we knew was Jessie was escaping finally but we didn't know what his future would hold.<br/><br/>El Camino did a great job of putting that to rest.
The only thing I wish was that they also showed us a bit of walts wife and kids and sister in law to show how much this whole thing must have messed them up.<br/><br/>8.3 Is it me or were there a lot of unanswered questions??? El Camino
Cinema 21
10/11/19<br/><br/>I had some conflicted feelings about El Camino when I first heard about it. Breaking Bad was such a great show to me and it ended perfectly. Much like The Sopranos: not every question got a concrete answer, but what's more important and what makes Sopranos and Breaking Bad such great shows wasn't the solution to every plot point but the way the end of the show made you feel. When Sopranos last episode fades to black your mind was racing: did the power go out? Is that it? What just happened? Breaking Bad ends the same way, I was immediately filled with questions. At first, I wanted just 10 more minutes of show, just to get my little satisfaction of seeing how things end with the White family, Skinny Pete, Badger, and most importantly Jesse Pinkman.<br/><br/>But a lot has changed since the show's ending in 2013, in those six years I fell in love with Breaking Bad's ending and accepted those questions did not need answers. Especially with Better Call Saul, the Breaking Bad spin-off being so unexpectedly fantastic. It scratched the itch, I sometimes felt for some new Breaking Bad content, but I was happy with what we had. When I heard about this movie a large part of me was incredibly excited, the smaller part of me thought: "Did we really need this to be made? Is this going to be terrible?" The answer to both questions is no. But life would be incredibly boring if we only did things that needed to be done and show creator and El Camino writer and director Vince Gilligan still has a lot to say.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see El Camino at a theater in Portland, which was a slightly surreal experience, I had only ever known Breaking Bad on a TV screen so to see Camino on such a large scale was wonderful. Breaking Bad always had such wonderful photography and El Camino is no different. The only disappointment in the look was it clearly was not shot on film, otherwise it's a beautiful movie. The entire vibe and color palate are reminiscent of those later episodes: cold. Camino seems to take place in winter, starkly contrasted to the warm, vibrancy we're used to in the earlier seasons of Breaking Bad. It sets the tone though, cold is pain. And what El Camino's main theme seems to be is dealing with pain.<br/><br/>There were moments in this film that hit me with unexpected emotion, the biggest being the passing of time and seeing how each performer has aged over the years. A lot of people have noticed this and talked about it; I find it frustrating people critique the film for this. Actors age. I am sorry I must be the one to tell you this. But I am so relieved Netflix and Gilligan did not digitally de-age anyone. It's been well over six years since these actors have performed these roles, they look a little different, get over it.<br/><br/>I wanted to write a spoiler free review, so I am not going to delve into the plot, but I wanted to point out that El Camino is a Breaking Bad movie not an extended episode. You have to adjust to its pace. It's a slow burn, Camino is in no rush to get to its conclusion. We're used to having Breaking Bad be 45-minute chunks of high tension and suspense, but Camino remains disciplined and steadfast in its pace.<br/><br/>Not to say Camino is boring, it's packed with brutal violence and explosive action pieces, dark and morbid humor and wonderful performances. Conversing with the friends I saw this with, we wondered how easy (or difficult) it was for these actors to jump back into roles they haven't played in over six years. No one felt out of place, no one felt rusty, Skinny Pete and Badger are still talking crap to each other and playing video games and smoking pot, but they also show maturity when things get real and they come through for Jesse when he needs them most. Charles Baker as Skinny Pete really brings a great performance here, we see his depth as an actor and his character's deep affection and admiration for his friend Jesse. Which leads me to Aaron Paul's performance.<br/><br/>Pinkman is such a fascinating character because he represents us, the viewer, he is constantly underestimated and dismissed by his "superiors." Paul's constantly evolving performance to a consistently growing character simply stated is perfect. Seeing this character arc is spectacular and cathartic.<br/><br/>El Camino, to me, represents the small victories Pinkman has to accomplish to put the past behind him and look forward to a future; we're not able to fix the past or make things right, but we can start fresh and try to be better going forward. El Camino is the conclusion, it's the end and I enjoyed being back in Albuquerque with these characters, characters I have spent a lot of time with. I am slightly conflicted on what El Camino will offer viewers unfamiliar with Breaking Bad. We have a gorgeously shot, wonderfully performed movie but is that enough to ensnare an audience who doesn't have six seasons of back story? Camino does a good job reminding us of what got us here without seeming like too much exposition, but I don't think it's enough to have the movie stand on its own completely. That stated, I think longtime fans can take a breath of relief, we have a wonderful conclusion to the story we fell in love with back in 2008. Apart from making little sense, and having me close to rapid eye movement 4, I can only believe the huge fans of BB are voting this up out of respect for the series, because this really fails in comparison.
One reviewer says, people expect too much,, so there are others that shade my disappointment, well I expect a story that doesn't take nr 1 hour to make any sense ! And overlong past scenes, of which if it wasn't for the stars shaved head you wouldn't have a clue what  was going on and where and when.
I missed opportunity, with a better script & more action (like the series) this might have been good.
Perhaps the team will come back with another story in Canada now, if they do it really wants to be better than this.
Still good if you need something to put you to sleep, btw I enjoy the series a lot. "El Camino" serves as an extremely satisfying epilogue to one of the greatest television series of the late 2000's.

In this crime film, Jesse Pinkman goes on the run from the police and tries to escape his own inner turmoil.

Taking place right after the events of the "Breaking Bad" series finale, "El Camino" feels needed. From the opening scene, you're hooked; just like you'd be on the series. Aaron Paul is incredible and this film is all him. Without Paul, "El Camino" might have been a total flop. This is not the case here. An intense yet slow burning two-hour ride that will make you want to revisit "Breaking Bad" all over again and make you realize what a great series it was. "Hey YO! WHAT HAPPEN TO PINK-MAN AFTER THE FINAL EPISODE?". So that's it. This 2 hours long movie is the answer to above question. Lower your expectation and watch the movie. YOU WILL BE SATISFIED. No action, no memorable dialog, and acting that was sub-par best describes what El Camino was all about. If anything I am a fan of the series and this movie despite closing up holes in the story's ending offers no entertainment. It just plain sucks. Yet I'm still giving it 6 stars because I love the characters other than that it wasn't worth the watch. I was really looking forward to this film. The series was magnificent and I expected nothing less of the film.
And it's certainly not bad.
It's quite slow but I wasn't really bored. The problem is it felt like the build-up to something exciting that never happened. When the film ends, you feel like "is that it??".
It feels like a long mid season filler than a grand finale. I suspect it will be forgotten about long before the series are even single episodes are. The series was great. This movie was about an hour longer than it should have been. I was not left with any feeling whatsoever. This is my opinion only. Quite a slow film with little action which was Ok, it felt like a really long episode which was fine and a nice ending in Alaska after discussions about it at the start of the film. I felt like the flashbacks were a bit pointless. Not on the same level as the TV show which was always going to be hard in 2 hours of a film I switched on Netflix tonight for the first time in a while and was genuinely excited to see El Camino. Do we need a Breaking Bad film? No probably not, the TV show was that rare thing, a long running drama, that not only didn't lose its way, but went from strength to strength. This right from the outset feels every bit an extension of the show, with Jesse picking up his timeline near seamlessly. So much so that if you don't remember how Breaking Bad ended, a recap would be a good idea before watching El Camino. This all alludes to it not working that well as a film. It doesn't feel at all cinematic. It's essentially an extended after-thought episode. Now that's not to say it's bad. There's lots of the charm of the original series, lots of familiar faces, lots of dust, time-lapses and unhinged lives. It's a nice addition alongside the amazing Better Call Saul, but where Saul/Jimmy's story is playfully fleshed out, Jesse's story here feels a little one dimensional and although it's fun to revisit, it all feels unnecessary. Worth watching though for Jesse Plemons and the sadly recently deceased Robert Forster alone.<br/><br/>6/10 It is en episode of two hours with plot of twendy minutes. I didn't expect something very special but it seems that you wach Pickman illusions. No saspens no interesting.
Familiar faces without something to say.My advice is ....wach it with a big cup of coffee As a fan of the show (though not nearly as passionate as many others), I was looking forward to this film. Jesse was a constant highlight throughout BREAKING BAD and I figured he deserved a proper sendoff. While Aaron Paul's excellent performance continues to impress, there is little else in this film that is worth 2 hours of your time; this is not to say that EL CAMINO is a bad film - just a mediocre one.<br/><br/>The first half of this film really worried me - it seemed to just jump directly into the action without bothering to set up any sort of narrative or motive. After a few minutes, this worry mostly went away; I was under the impression the film would be about Jesse, Pete, and Badger working to ensure their freedom. However, after the first twenty-or-so minutes, the film completely abandons them, and I was back to feeling lost.<br/><br/>The film continues, for the next forty minutes or so, to focus on the relationship between Jesse and Todd between the events of GRANITE STATE and FELINA, interspersed with 'present-day' scenes of Jesse using his memory of these times to try and find Todd's money, for reasons that aren't made clear to us until much later in the movie. This portion of the film failed to impress in any way, as forced and illogical tension, with the addition of very on-the-nose dialogue from all parties, really drove home what this film really was: shallow fan service.<br/><br/>Following this, the movie has a sharp uptick in quality. Jesse takes his money to Ed (the disappearing man from the very late episodes of the show) and attempts to buy his services once again. For whatever reason, good dialogue, logic, and depth all resurface in this scene, and this level of - I don't want to say excellence, but it's close - continues well into the rest of the film, roughly until the cameo return of Bryan Cranston's Walter White.<br/><br/>At that point, the film sinks comfortably back into its shallow mask, and doesn't quite resurface. The film ends almost jarringly, and just as open-ended as it did in FELINA. At least we know that Jesse is (probably) going to be safe, but it doesn't feel like much of a conclusion. I generally fail to see why this movie exists.<br/><br/>A decent popcorn flick for fans of BREAKING BAD, but if you expect anything close to the excellence and general depth of the series, you're sadly out of luck. Yes, it was nice to see some of the characters from the original series. Yes, it was also nice to feel the Breaking Bad-ish atmosphere, but did we really need an ending to Jesse's story? Wasn't the final episode the best we could hope for? Could it even get any better than that? What I mean is that this movie couldn't be satisfying enough after the series finale because it was already the best version that could ever be made. I just loves this movie! Pinkman is the man! Aaron Paul is a great actor! Breaking Bad is a huge hit so a movie was going to happen eventually. Breaking Bad is awesome, I mostly watched it in reruns.<br/><br/>El Camino is a direct sequel following Jesse Pinkman, he's hiding from the police and trying to restart his life. El Camino is non linear, it shifts back and forth between flashbacks of Jesse's captivity and the present time.<br/><br/>El Camino is slow paced like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, two flashbacks were a little overlong. Yes, it's intense and violent.<br/><br/>The acting is good as expected, nobody phoned it in. Aaron Paul naturally slipped back into his iconic role, I never doubted him. Robert Forster reprises his role as Ed but it's his final role since he just passed away from brain cancer.<br/><br/>Jesse hides with his friends Badger and Skinny Pete, I find them forgettable. They're the comic relief, I chuckled only once.<br/><br/>El Camino is a good finale for Breaking Bad and it's only made for the fans. El Camino has a Breaking Bad recap but it's still not for newcomers. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are on Netflix so you can easily watch them if you're interested. Breaking Bad was one of those special shows where everything seemed to come together perfectly. The performances, the monologues, those gorgeous shots of Albuquerque and so much more worked in a way that escalated the series into being one of the greatest shows ever made. So even with the ideal closure that series finale provided, we were all still left wanting more. We got some of that with Better Call Saul, but now El Camino sets out to continue Jesse's story after Breaking Bad and give us some more closure for one of our favourite meth dealers.<br/><br/>It starts off exactly where Breaking Bad left us, with Jesse speeding down an empty road finally free after months of being enslaved and forced to make meth by a group of white supremacists (that's a heck of a strange sentence that only makes sense with a show as insane as Breaking Bad). But with the police on his trail, Jesse needs to find a way to get enough money together to get out of town and start a new life. Plus throughout the film Jesse is suffering with PTSD, being haunted by the ghosts of his past and his own mistakes.<br/><br/>The greatest compliment that I can give the film is that it fits in nicely with the rest of the series and upholds Breaking Bad's legacy. Vince Gilligan brings the same creative energy to this film that he brought to the original series and we get a lot of great moments ranging from nail biting suspense to the kind of dark humour that Breaking Bad always excelled at.<br/><br/>Plus Aaron Paul is on top form as Jesse providing a few moments that are up there with some of his best moments from the show. It's also really interesting seeing him play a younger Jesse during several flashbacks and how easily he can still slip in to the carefree version of him that we knew when the show was only just starting. Then only moments later the film will cut to the current Jesse, with the stark contrast in Paul's performance being a strong reminder of how much the past few years ended up weighing on him.<br/><br/>Outside of Aaron Paul we also get several cameos from some of the shows best characters (none of whom I'll reveal, but the IMDB castlisting could give some surprises away). When we first see some of them it is a bit disjointing given that some of them are 6 years older since we've last seen them, but honestly I got sucked into the scenes so quickly that I quickly forgot about how different they looked. Two of the returning characters are playing substantial roles in the film and end up stealing the scenes that they're in. The other cameos are a lot more limited and some of them were probably just fit in when the actors just had a spare day in their schedule to film their scenes. But they all work well within the context of the film and they all provide some interesting reflections on the morality of the past few years of Jesse's life.<br/><br/>Though the one defining feature that is lacking which the original show excelled at is the character development which was always at its core. Whilst it does provide us with a little more closure for what happened to Jesse, he's still the same person that he was at the end of the show and the film doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know about him after watching him develop for the past 5 seasons. Also whilst the show does provide a more conclusive ending for Jesse, it doesn't really offer us anything that beats those incredible seconds of relief and pure agony that the show originally left us on.<br/><br/>Ultimately the film is a victory lap for one of the greatest shows of all time. So if you're somebody who's never seen Breaking Bad, you're probably not going to follow much of what's going on here and I seriously recommend either buying the boxset or watching the series on Netflix since you're missing out on some great television ever produced. But if you're a Breaking Bad junkie who's been jonesing for some more awesome moments, this film definitely delivers. And who knows, with so many great characters I'd be open to seeing some more spinoff films in the future. Maybe one day we might even learn whether Huell ever made it out of that room. I was worried about this when Netflix announced it. Was it necessary? Would it try to be something different to the tv series? I didn't watch the trailer. I pressed play with what I'm sure was a concerned look on my face. I needn't have worried. Vince Gilligan pulled it off as usual, and managed to convince me along the way that this was a story worth telling. It is not an action movie, which was perhaps my biggest concern. It draws you right back into the Br Ba universe. It's almost comfortable watching, like seeing old friends. It only seems to add, not subtract from the original masterpiece, and having seen it I can't imagine the story feeling complete without it. This for me was the final chapter for everyone that was routing for Jesse Pinkman.
It had all the perfection that was delivered in Breaking Bad and the ongoing Better call Saul. The acting just seems effortlessly delightful, which compliments the excellent written Vince Gilligan.
No matter how much I want to see how Jesse sort his life I'm glad that all the questions I had were answered.
All in all another great production by the whole team. It was a tad slow and drawn out; could have been a half hour shorter.<br/><br/>We already got a sense of freedom and a hopeful ending for Jesse from how the series ended, so this movie was just an addendum to that with more detail and backstory. It was fun to revisit a character and series we all love. After what happened in the Finale of Breaking bad This Movie is beginning , jesse the runner from cops , it's a good Movie with good direction , and aaron paul is a perfect actor
I rated 8/10 My excitement for this film was through the roof. My expectations unrealistic. So the fact that I can say I was satisfied by the credits makes my very happy.<br/><br/>The acting and cinematography were perfect, just as they were in the show. Aaron Paul steals the show as Jesse in a last ditch attempt to start a new life. He really sells the desperation.<br/><br/>I believe this film may fall victim to its own hype. If you like slowburn movies with beautiful visuals and superb acting, then I believe you will like this film. But it seems nowadays that audiences aren't fans of slow movies and unconventional storytelling.<br/><br/>Overall my only issue with the film was a returning actor had gained a very noticeable amount of weight. Their performance was brilliant but it did take me out of the film. Other than that, I don't really have any flaws. A fantastic coda to the best series ever made. I don't know what some of you expected, but honestly, this was all about giving the second most important character the ending that he deserves. It never meant to be a movie full of action and plot twists - and this is what you see through the whole plot. Creators and producers have finally brought the series to an end and managed to show off great writing, directing and pictures! Thank you, Vince! After we got over the breath taking series, everyone wondered what happened to Jessie. El Camino has done justice to the character of Jessie and how he drives off over his inner turmoil.<br/><br/>Vince has done justice to the character and to the series title as Jessie breaks bad and finds inner peace towards the end.<br/><br/>Kudos to Vince! The director moves the film well forward. Great cuts in editing. Good camera moves. Great story line. And most of all, the wonderful role-playing by Aaron paul Today the premier of the anticipated movie El Camino a Breaking Bad movie. Stars Aaron Paul as he is on the run the cops and from his past. Now if you are fan of the Breaking Bad you need to watch it, if you're not. It will recap what has happened. Now the movie is slow like the tv series, but it does pick up. The movie is a fun ride of Jesse. There are tons of surprises throughout the movie. Just pay attention to it. You might miss it. This is a fun movie. But I feel like the last 30 minutes were rushed. The characters are great, lots of lovable characters. The storyline is good, like I said before. It was rushed in the last 30 minutes. You should enjoy this movie. Like I did. But there are some untold stories that still need to be told. Overall this is a wonderful movie. My rating is 7/10. #elcamino #breakingbad #aaronpaul #jessepinkman #walterwhite #netflix Wow this was an over hyped bore fest, was looking forward to this and all it was was boring very slow to get going and then when it did it just ended. Would not recommend. (GoT) Learn how to write a great ending.
Watch Breaking bad beginning to end, and then watch this. Absolutely needed this closure. Thank you Vince for writing/directing this I can sleep peacefully. I think it's so important that people don't let their imaginations carry them away. El Camino is Jesse's goodbye. An epilogue to the main story. It's not going to change Breaking Bad as you knew it, there is no final twist that outranks them all.<br/><br/>It's a Breaking Bad story. It was made to solidify the already inpenatrable mantle that the show sits on. It does that with the exact same care, craft and execution that we came to expect of Vince Gilligan. It's a story that we've seen before, done masterfully.<br/><br/>Did they need to do it? Not at all.<br/><br/>Did it strengthen or weaken the ending of Breaking Bad? It finally closed the book on one of TVs greatest stories. I think that's all you need to know.<br/><br/>Thank you. Only problem I got is how Pinkman got fat in that hole.. Love movie.. BrBa is one of rare tv shows who really got good ending.. This is just bonus for the end Brilliant! This Breaking Bad sequel sizzles like the award-winning series but also has the subversive stylistic touches of BB's prequel, Better Call Saul. Jess is trying to flee the slow explosion of events that Walt set in motion before he was killed, but where will Jess go in Todd's El Camino and will he be able to escape his past successfully? Watch for a few other characters from the BB-verse, some unexpected! This movie is goals for BB and Better Call Saul fans alike. I am one of the biggest Breaking Bad Fans. I absolutely loved the Sopranos and the Wire, but nothing can touch Breaking Bad. I am happy that Vince Gilligan decided to add a final chapter to the series, a chapter that made Jesse's life and final farewell more palatable. I did not like seeing Jesse suffering in that filthy cage in the ground, but that is one of the horrendous consequences of being a drug lord....other criminals are after you to get their hands on your stuff. One thing I wanted to point out, why was the RV with the bullet holes shown in the movie? Wasn't it destroyed and turned into "patio furniture" at Old Joe's yard? Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and I was very happy to see that our favorite teacher and cook is still alive. I'm not sure what the purpose of this film was? We see that Jesse escapes in the end... Much the same way he did at the end of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Dedicating 2 hours to show Jesse get to Alaska seems kinda pointless. It didn't really
tie up Jesse's storyline since we assumed he got away already in BB.<br/><br/>To be honest, I think this film was purely fan service. It made me nostalgic of the original series but let's be real, without Walt there's little story.. and they made the right call NOT to bring him back. It was too unlikely given he was bleeding out surrounded by cops at the end of series and would have ruined his story.<br/><br/>Bottom line: you won't miss anything if you don't watch this film. 4/10. In short: excellent cinematography, great writing and brilliant acting. So it's Breaking Bad but shot with a fantastic camera - the new visuals create an interesting spin on the series' atmosphere.<br/><br/>When Breaking Bad was over I didn't feel like I needed any more closure and, honestly, I still feel that way. It wasn't exactly necessary for the audience to see Mr.Pinkman safe & sound and out of harm's way because (at least from my experience) we just assumed that he was going to be okay once he'd broken free.<br/><br/>As soon as it booted up though, I realised just how much I missed this show and its unique feel. We follow Jesse straight after his escape from the "Good ol' boys" club and follow him as he plans to escape the heat of Albuquerque. When you break it down it's actually a pretty simple story, interspersed with flashbacks to his time in imprisonment. But it's got that BB charm to a T and I couldn't believe it when it was all over - I could easily have watched "El Camino" over another season of TV.<br/><br/>I think this film would've been an easy 9/10 if the scope was just a little wider. It would've been nice to see the film explore the conflict with law enforcement and give us a little more "Jesse on the run" and a little less of the flashbacks (which were fantastic but they felt like they took up a good chunk of the 2hr run time).<br/><br/>But what do I know? El Camino is a thrilling experience nonetheless and a fitting farewell to the story. I liked this a lot. It doesn't really add or subtract anything from Breaking Bad. You don't have to watch it, but, you will probably like it if you do. It does a good job of resolving Jesse's story. There are lots of nice cameo's and the story is good. Aaron Paul proves that he is capable of being the lead actor in a movie. I know it will not happen, but, I would actually like Jesse to get his own spin off series like Better Call Saul. Vince Gilligan is an amazingly good writer. Not good not very bad, the story is good, fantastic flash back Although todd is became fat, no big plot. We learn that Mike inspired Jesse to want to relocate to Alaska! Todd was even more psycho than we originally saw. Skinny Pete & Badger are the kind of friends we wish we all had! Robert Forester's character doesn't forget. Old Joe is a massive help, even though we only see him for a minute. So, mind at ease! We learn very early in the film that Heisenberg is indeed dead via radio broadcast! With a good many of the new baddies Jesse reputation precedes him. This is a very good solid film. Yet when it ended it felt as though something was missing. Okay, peace out! I was wondering what they were up to, and what we got is a very nice farewell to Jesse. This is not part of the series, and so I think it's fair to rate it on it's own. BB is a straight 10 to me, this movie is an add-on to fix a loose end (which was ok as it was), no thriller or something, nothing revealing. What I liked most is that Jesse really has some friends - that made me smile :-) I love that they made this movie! I didn't think I needed it so badly haha! BB was already wrapped up perfectly, right to the last second of the last frame, even the song playing.
Absolute Perfection! They paid close attention to every single detail. I watched the series twice, and the last 8 of season 5, I watched 3 times. It just never fails to disappoint. It's without a doubt the best series ever made!!
I laugh when people say GoT is the best. After the last few episodes, I felt robbed of years of my life. Anywho...this movie was a nice little bow on the perfect gift. Thank you for that Vince Gilligan, thank you!!
Plus, I love Jessie. I was so happy to see him again. Skinny Pete and Badger are always a treat. You won't be mad at it, not if you love BB like the rest of us. If you thought that you were gonna get a movie that's the same as breaking bad you're wrong.El Camino has a touch of breaking bad.In this movie you see how hard it is to get back on your feet from making mistakes.You can see a broken Jesse put his pieces back together.What I truly enjoyed was the ending and Jesse getting what he wanted.In the breaking bad ending you don't know if Jesse could've made it in the outside world or not.It also shows you how intelligent Jesse has become from his experience.Must watch! In addition to the return of outstanding actors who repeated their cult roles, the film includes amazing camera work and incredible music<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan's screenplay and directing are great<br/><br/>Aaron Paul 😍😎<br/><br/>The Best Final for Jesse<br/><br/>👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 My heart is racing right now. This movie pulled a lot at my strings. I'm pumped up with adrenaline now. This movie was announced out of nowhere and surprised everyone. We all thought Breaking Bad was over. We all thought the story had been told. We all thought we had reached the end. We were wrong.<br/><br/>"El Camino : A Breaking Bad Movie" picks up immediatly after the conclusion of Breaking Bad and follows its protoganist Jesse Pinkman as he evades capture whilst trying to stay alive. If you have never seen Breaking Bad, the movie descibes what happens at the end and gives a summary of many of the plot points of the series.<br/><br/>As a huge Breaking Bad fan, I was drawn in to the carnage that befalls Jesse. Writer/Director Vince Gilligan is a master at creating suspense and keeping viewers fearing for the lives of the characters. El Camino keeps the tension of the series and intesifies it. While the show was dark, El Camino is much more gitty, with no censorship on the blood or profanity. In a way it reflects the abuse Jesses has gone though up to this point.<br/><br/>Even if you are strong emotionally, I doubt you could sit through this without feeling changed as I did. Its a rollercoaster of a ride that was years in the making. This a hear wrentching epilogue that concludes the Breaking Bad series witha bang It's super good the work is super good and the music is on point I almost rated more than 200 titles on IMDb and this is the first time I'm writing a review.
I have always been a fan of entire Breaking Bad series. "Heisenberg" was the biggest motivational character that I have ever seen on a Digital platform.
Strategic story telling is what makes a viewer stick to the screens. By the end of the show its not about meaning but, it is about the feeling that you have filled in audiences hearts.<br/><br/>The entire series and this movie shows us how far a man can get to satisfy his preferences. Walter White was never really satisfied with himself. All he wanted was to become Heisenberg and he risked everything for that. If becoming Heisenberg was what mattered Walter the most, loving and taking the responsibility of Brock Cantillo and suffering to keep him safe mattered the most to Jessie Pinkman.
We have never really got the opportunity to understand Jessie in Breaking Bad. The viewers were lost in the magical transformation of Walter White to Heisenberg. Of course, we got some scenes where we came to know that Jessie loves children. But, why does he love children? How much risk would he take and how much suffering would he bear for the things that mattered him the most were never really shown or noticed by audience in Breaking Bad. That's where this movie comes. This is the best farewell that a director can give to the character of Jessie Pinkman.
After watching this movie, I don't really see any difference between Jessie and Walter White. The entire franchise of Breaking Bad is about two men, striving to satisfy their preferences. Their chosen paths might have been different but, the thing that they ultimately wanted was quiet similar.<br/><br/><ul><li>It was all about the preferences</li></ul> It was good but can be better with showing walter jr and skyler because how there lifes were affected at the time they were low on money Netflix brought this movie to bring back old good times and also for money . This movie features a hand full of acquentence that might mould the movie. But like any Netflix original movie this is no success. For those who where waiting, its a little disappointment.
Still its well executed around survival and production might think to take it bit further.

Aaron Paul aka Jesse Pinkman: 10 🌟 Before The Walking Dead made it one of the top cable channels in the US, Breaking Bad along with Mad Men was helping build AMC as a home for some of the best written shows on TV.<br/><br/>For 5 seasons up until its final episode, in September 2013, Breaking Bad was considered by many as one of the greatest shows ever created and as one of the few tv dramas to have a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Surprisingly a prequel series was created involving the supporting character Saul Goodman, it seemed like an odd choice but turned out to be a show worthy of being in the Breaking Bad universe.<br/><br/>Even more surprisingly Netflix and AMC announced plans to produce a 2 hour movie following what happened to Jesse Pinkman after the show ended.<br/><br/>The movie picks up exactly where the show ended, with Jesse driving away from where he had been held captive for years. From there we follow Jesse try to get rid of the El Camino he drove off in, get money he needs to pay off a debt and then attempt to get the hell out of Albuquerque.<br/><br/>What we get here is a film made solely for fans of the show that wanted just that little bit more time in this world. The film is unnecessary as the show didn't leave any loose ends that the audience was craving to have resolved.<br/><br/>While uneccessary it was nice to have the focus shifted to Jesse as he would often get put on the sidelines in the series as the show was understandably in love with its lead character. So it was nice to see Jesse as the lead and Aaron Paul acted like he had never taken a six year break from the show.<br/><br/>There are appearances from some characters of the show. Some important ones and some that were in one episode. The one other character from the show that plays a decent sized part in the movie is Jesse Plemons as Todd. I love Plemons in this role, he plays the character as dumb but also unhinged and could do anything to you at anytime. He is legitimately scary.<br/><br/>Fans of the show should get a kick out of this. A nice farewell for Jesse Pinkman and a good reminder of how great the show was:<br/><br/>4 stars First of all few die hard fans (im one of em) of Breaking Bad are calling this a masterpiece which it obviously isn't but it is a great farewell to Jesse 'Biatch' Pinkman. I saw it coming but not exactly kinda because of the way it was hyped ,I knew that Jesse's character isn't that much of a deal like Walt or Gustavo were as they were very interesting .Still the cinematography was lit.I knew at the climax he'd something for that Brock kid but i also thought he would've done the same thing to Mike 's granddaughter given Jesse likes kids and Jesse's Teacher-Student relationship with Mike and also i feel very bad for that kid.There was nothing new in the movie but i still appreciate it because its not some run off the mill action packed sequel or something.Concluding, this is a decent watch but an great ode to the character we all love,bit of fan service here and there so its a must watch for Breaking Bad freaks like me. When the trailer arrived I was in awe of what I had seen in it. But after seeing the film, well I say was a bit disappointed. But do watch it. Vince Gilligan is a genius, whatever he makes becomes gold!! Jesse Pinkman was supposed to get killed in the season 1 of BREAKING BAD, that's what I had heard but after these many years, seeing him fighting for his fresh start has really reminded me of his long journey inside BREAKING BAD universe, Pinkman has seen a lot and gone through a lot in this journey but at last he got what he deserved! Seeing Cranston, Banks and finally Ritter DID actually made me smile in a satisfying manner. Brilliant ending as well as wonderful story writing, thanks to sir Gilligan once again and looking forward to seeing his work on BETTER CALL SAUL season 5. Really not worth the watch. Didn't need to be made, but since they did it could have been about something. zero story. zero entertainment. Because this move remember me breaking bad agin .. and benkman he was amazing I found it physically painful to watch. Like waiting for a leaking tap to drip......drip..................drip. It felt like a filler episode, like the one about the fly, where they ran out of money or something and you kept expecting something - anything! - to happen. I stopped watching after the stupid shootout so I don't know if anything did happen. I don't really care. As a movie I give it 4 of 10. Breaking Bad fans will give a high rat as a closure. Nothing happens. I like BB and BCS but this is garbage . Cash grab I came to Breaking Bad late. It was the show that the world was talking about. And from the first episode, like a hit from Jesse's Blue Sky, I was hooked. It was a monumental piece of television. Perfect in every way. It broke boundaries that only it had itself had created. We respected Walter White, but we fell in love with Jesse Pinkman. As he drove full throttle, wild eyed and screaming into the night, I knew I was coming to the end of my flawed but beautiful addiction. Following the final episode I was so emotionally drained I couldn't even speak to my family for the rest of the day. No movie or TV show had ever affected me this way before. I needed BB rehab.
This movie felt like a relapse. I was years into recovery, and even though I knew it would be Bbad, the promise of more was just too much to resist.
I could feel my emotions being teased as I watched, desperate for a spiritual salvation....but like any relapse, it just got worse. I hope I'm never given the chance of another hit of Blue Sky. Not sure what else to describe that viewing except Meh. Yes like everyone else I expected more. Pretty boring if I'm honest! I think the problem with El Camino is that the movie is a wrap-up and doesn't contain a meaningful storyline of it's own. So all you get is filler flash backs, a SMALL subplot with new side characters related to the flashbacks. Since the new characters haven't been introduced before in a span of 5 seasons they aren't anywhere near interesting compaired to someone like Gustavo Fring.<br/><br/>They would've been better off building a storyline with the characters that where alive from the previous seasons although I understand that some of them might not be available as a cast... It's not even a movie, it's like a long episode. I had to skip so many parts after half of the movie.<br/><br/>It's very long, boring, senseless. Poor performances by the same actors that played in Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad is my favorite show, El Camino is worst movie I've seen recently. It's an disappointing movie, why they pun in name "an breaking bad movie "?... Breaking bad is all about the legend of walter white.there was no need to make this movie. Great freaking movie! Entertaining from start to finish. I've never seen this show, but this movie was great regardless! The film centers on Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who was let loose and is wanted by the law. He wants to go to Alaska and start a new life.<br/><br/>I imagine you had to have been intimate with the film "Breaking Bad" to understand this incoherent mess. There was little to no explanation as to what was happening in a plot that was not linear. Jesse was a screw up and not a great protagonist.<br/><br/>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. It's a fitting wrap to Jesse's story.
I didn't expect more of Breaking Bad and so I really like this for what it was. What was this? This was boring...extremely boring. Basically nothing happened. This was a disgrace to the series. Honestly was just a decent movie. Good ending to a good series without trying to over- do it. 8 out of 10 Great acting especially by Aaron Paul, greatly directed & written ...was my reaction as the movie drew to a close.<br/><br/>Jesse, who's all "grows up" from the "yo b*tch representing the ABQ" character dressed in those colorful, baggy get-ups with his signature skull cap in the beginning of BB to a young man to reminding me of what Tony Soprano used to say "like Gary Cooper, the strong, silent type". Yes, he's been severely scarred from what we now saw as nothing less then daily torture and humiliation from those neo-nazi's who were clearly stuck in 1994. Kind of would like to have seen Jesse get revenge on those guys. However we got to see some of that at the end of the BB series.<br/><br/>This movie was excellent as I was sure it was going to be. Vince Gilligan is nothing less then a creative genius whose talent provides us with a combination of suspense, humor (Skinny P and Badger...all's I'm sayin') and just a dash of grittiness.<br/><br/>As much as I loved the ending of BB. In the back of my mind I wished Walt would have just walked out into the darkness before the cops showed up leaving us guessing if he died or not. Exactly the way The Sopranos ended with the infamous "fade to black". As much as I remember screaming in disbelief at the TV screen, that type of ending allows that character to always have a chance of coming back.
With that being said, even though we got to see Walt in a flashback from the "4 Days Out" episode of season 2 when they planned on hitting a Denny's and sleeping in a hotel, I really wanted to see them reunite after some really horrible things were done to each other during season 6. Both gave each other that "silent nod" at the end of the series just before Jesse drives off in the El Camino and makes a break for it. However, the relationship the two had was so incredibly dynamic and intense - much like that of a father and son, that I was left with wanting more of seeing them together.<br/><br/>
All in all this movie was exactly what I expected...total brilliance. Seriously. 😉 We cannot let tgis movie have less then star wars 7! It was a great ending for jesse pinkmen ,
It was what evey BrBa fan wants
""((closure))""😁👍 Definitely a 10 out of 10 in my book...it is and does exactly what a follow up movie should do... it answers many unanswered questions... I'm still left wanting more though :-) Where is Walter White?! Jesse hasn't charisma to be the main personage.The ending is weak and boring.Jesse's friends are just super! The Atmosphere of the movie is good and dark-I like it. Boring as it gets, little interest, little humour, terrible plot and I'm absolutely gutted. I cannot fathom how anyone found this film remotely rewarding, interesting or ... anything. In time this score will plummet. This movie basically was made because they forgot to give a redemptive closure to Jessi. This whole arc could be covered in less than 20 minutes in the ending episode of breaking bad but because the the main character was Walter, there wasn't enough time or really a good way to show it. The whole thing with the two imposter cops was pointless and at the same time the only interesting thing about this movie. I don't get how the whole wild west thing was redemptive. Or even the way he deceived his parents. I was rather amazed at what a cut and paste, slapdash this was. Though it was great to see some of the characters from the show, so many of the storylines it starts are left dangling. The whole thing looks like a sad vehicle to prolong the show in viewers' memories which is ridiculous; this was a show no one could forget. Though a necessary extension, to the (Jesse's) story, it comes across as rushed and not at all well thought out, and in the end it's just a soup of old faves thrown together for the appeasement of the viewer. I was truly amazed that Gilligan would willingly put together something so mis-structured. Not what I expected... totally overrated
Was just okay Just average. Nothing special. Nothing is added, you pretty much know the entire movie before watching. I needed this movie. I always wondered what would happen to Jesse.<br/><br/>Good movie, a great farewell. OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I FELT THEY SHOULD'VE USED DEAGING TECHNOLOGY ON JESSIE, THIS MOVIE WAS SPLENDIDLY DONE IN ONLY THE WAY VINCE GILLIGAN CAN DREAM UP. YOU KNOW A MOVIE IS GOOD WHEN IT SUDDENLY LEAVES YOU WANTING FOR MORE... I ENJOYED THE FEW SURPRISES THAT WERE THROWN IN AND I'M READY AND HOPING FOR MORE TO COME IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. El Camino takes place right after the Ending of Breaking Bad. It shows how Jesse must escape and free himself from everything he got into. Vince Gilligan created the show and he comes back to make this movie. And he does such an amazing job handling Jesse's Story. Every goodbye Jesse says to his friends or family is so heartbreaking and yet at the same time you feel happy for him. There are AWESOME cameos that I obviously will not Spoil but you're gonna love them. Only really minor issue is that there are flashback scenes and characters from those scenes don't look the way they should if you go back and watch Season 5 of Breaking Bad. And also it's just a tad bit predictable, but I won't take off my score just for those things. If you seen the movie already there's this one person, and I think you'll know who I'm talking about lol. If you LOVED Breaking Bad like myself, I can't see how you would not like this movie if your a fan. Overall, it's a beautiful Conclusion for Jesse and to the already AMAZING Breaking Bad show. This just proves that Breaking Bad will go down as probably the Greatest Show of All Time. (And it already was before El Camino) So nice to see Walter again.
I had goosebumps when I saw Jesse and Walter for one last time. Man what a movie. Sad Robert passed today. I have to watch this again now after hearing the sad news. It's the perfect send off for Pinkman and the show in general. 10/10. Great job Vince. Oh and Robert is great in this as is most of the actors. Some old, some new. I am a big fan of Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and now El Camino. The movie contain as many nail-biting moments as the show used to spread over a full season and gives him something new to be, an hero who is uniquely conflicted, exhausted and in many ways, a broken one. Despite its pace and scale, one of the greatest pleasures of El Camino is that it still makes space for the mixture of thriller and humour we have gotten just like the show.<br/><br/>Crediting Vince Gilligan, who wrote and directed the film, that it feels like a continuation of Breaking Bad without also feeling like merely an extra-long TV episode. It's a true movie, with the balanced pacing, satisfying conclusion and grand visual scale. It avoids many difficulties of turning a tv show into a movie, it wasn't made for the sake of fan-servicing and truly does the show a justice and completes the unfinished portrait of Jesse character who remains on viewers' minds. Another addition to the masterpiece that is the breaking bad continuity<br/><br/>It's the Jesse epilogue everyone needed<br/><br/>Incredible cinematography, writing, very introspective, don't expect anything other than pure Jesse Pinkman though, it's all about him Wow. As the biggest fan boy of the Breaking Bad universe I was waiting to be let down.... And in no way did that happen.
Bravo Vince, Aaron and everyone involved.
Thankyou! A strong addition to Breaking Bad, great to see the characters again and the pacing is perfect for a solid 2 hours. Watch without spoilers. Really gonna miss Breaking Bad
Vince please make another film Let me start off by saying I'm a massive fan of Breaking Bad. I've watched the series at least 3 times. When I heard about this film I was very sceptical as I wondered how it would work. It was nice to see some of the old cast reprise their roles but overall the film was stale. It really struggled to catch my attention since watching it last night I cant remember one stand out scene. I'll leave the review here as I dont want to bath it too much. People may enjoy it but myself and the wife found it boring and average. Such a slow paced movie ... For what after 5 years? To give some ending by stretching the characters. Poor action . Why adding a movie, like a few more episodes to the best série of the past decade. I would rather not have seen it. Netflix is totally questionable when it comes to producing movies !
Some BreakingBad fans will enjoy this 2 hours long show, they should binge the serie instead of expecting something new . Movie is about remembering the classic series and adds almost nothing to the original part. Nostalgic trip to old characters that jump from one location and events into another - and the escape trip is just a backbone that all of it is built upon. My lady fell asleep like 4 times and I did have to check time left to the and too many times. Reminds me episode about the Albuquerque fly- just pointless... Could of/should of been good. Nothing of any value in the story line that gained from the original TV series. Not much to say here.
Never liked breaking bad, and the movie itself adds nothing new to the overall show.
Jessie tries to get out of the country and searching for some missimg blood money. And shoots down some trailer trash along the way.
It's a humorless boring ride filled with flashbacks. Its like the Solo starwars in a way.
Nobody cares about the character Jessie still we have this movie in lack of imagination from Netflix.
And who's really gonna watch it? Only the Ones that saw the show Will be semi-invested in el camino. I think it was truly pointless and not needed! it was way to hyped it was nice to see the characters again but there really was no need for the film! BB was way above this, just let it rest. You guys did wonderfull job on BB but dont milk the cow until it's dead. There are way better fan theories than this script. 2 stars for the effort in vain. It was not commercial and it was very frustrating to add a new film that was not necessary I was hyped to watch this movie I've watched the TV series countless times already...but this sh** right here was straight trash! This movies wack! Such a disappointment! I thought there would be some excitement and carnage. Total disappointment; had to fast forward most of the movie. I loved Breaking Bad. I loved every episode despite it often lingering on scenes.<br/><br/>This movie is shallow and barely moves Jessie Pinkmans story forward. It felt more like they released this movie just reminisce on the "good old days" of breaking bad.<br/><br/>The flashbacks were also unnecessary.<br/><br/>This movie had some potential, but unfortunately failed to reach it See title

See title Money I guess? Right? Just to get that money. Now you're probably going to make a series from this like "better call Saul"?<br/><br/>This is like Disney. The cartoon was fine, but they're greedy and need more money. So why not making it full CGI! Aaron Paul truly delivers the goods! Oscar worthy performance here!, so sad this may be the last Breaking Bad related content besides Better Call Saul!!!! What a beautiful ending and wonderful wrap up to this amazing character Jesse Pinkman! Strongest of recommends!!! This reminded me of when I forced myself to continue to watch TWD even after it was awful and had no hope of returning. This movie was slow, sad and boring. I knew it within the first 2 minutes but forced myself to watch it. Don't!!!!!! So good to Jessi back!! I hated to see movie End! I Hope there may be more movies to come!! Excellent Movie!! I am a huge fan of breaking bad . Breaking bad ending makes me sad and internally cry. El camino will same as per expectations .Just do and watch why you wasting your time on reading my reviews I love breaking bad but this film sucked no story line at all and so boring please dont bother To put it succinctly, the entire movie was just blah. And for the life of me I couldn't figure out why. I absolutely LOVED Breaking Bad. It was without a doubt one of my favorite series of all time.<br/><br/>So why didn't I like El Camino?<br/><br/>To me everything about it seemed wrong. It felt rushed. Unfinished. Trite.<br/><br/>I kept watching and waiting to be drawn in, to become totally immersed like I was when watching the series. But it didn't happen.<br/><br/>Then, at about the 15 minute to end mark I found out why.<br/><br/>There is a flashback scene where Jesse is talking with Walter White. It was good. It felt right. It's what I wanted to see.<br/><br/>And then it donned on me.<br/><br/>This story is about Jesse. And Jesse only.<br/><br/>While the Breaking Bad series was constantly inter-cut with different stories of different characters, there was none of that here. It was Jesse 100% of the time.<br/><br/>And honestly that made the whole experience rather dull.<br/><br/>The short scene that showed the interactions between Jesse and Walter White is what I was longing for in this movie, but short it was and it wasn't enough to make me feel good about having watched this.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say this is not a must watch for even the most die hard Breaking Bad fans out there.<br/><br/>It really brings nothing new "closure-wise" to the story, at least nothing that is pertinent to the Breaking Bad experience as a whole. Very nostalgic flash backs, then turned it off half way through because it was boring. By the way thought the series was amazing for its time just not sure what the hype about this was! JUST LIKE THE SHOW.
Vince Gilligan he just a lucky writer but not a great one Loved it, basically the story of Jesse Pinkman following on from the end of the series. Brilliantly written and great to see lots of original characters. There were 14,000,604 ways to harm the show with this movie...Gilligan chose the one that doesn't.
Chapeau Well... this is not even remotely close to "Breaking Bad" and the same is true for any comparison to "bettet thrust Saul".<br/><br/>Jesy without Walt, Mike, Saul and Gus... nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>The story is dull and boring and the only interesting parts are flashbacks from the past.<br/><br/>This movie was made for... money money money.<br/><br/>But... how can anyone who loved breaking bad say no to this movie? Just for the sake of memory? Just for seing Walt and Mike again even if it is just flashbacks?<br/><br/>... and yes, it is just flashbacks... they did not survive their death on the last Breaking Bad season... even though I really really hopped they did by some miracle... they are dead... and so is rhis really really stupid shallow unnecessary movie. I don't want to spoil any thing
But daamn
he did it again
Vince is a one hell of a kind
one of the most intelligent, creative director Was this film necessary? Not really, no. Does it continue the annoying trend of every single show of the past being brought back, even when most of the times it's not needed? Yes. Is it a good film? Perhaps. Is it a good chapter in the Breaking Bad saga? Definitely.<br/><br/>If Felina had been the penultimate episode of the series and this had aired a week after, like the official series finale, then it would have fit right along with the series. All of the show's trademark aspects of it are here (the pacing, the cinematography, the score). Technically, it's a really well-accomplished piece of story. The problem is that, years later for it to air as a single film, it does feel more unnecessary than it would have had it aired when the show was still going on. It's basically an epilogue to Jesse's story and it clears any ambiguity there was about his future going forward after the series finale. Although I did enjoy it, I can absolutely understand anyone thinking it wasn't needed and doesn't add anything new. For me, I'm glad it exists and I'm glad I know what happened. I think most of it works, although there are sections that do feel dragged on without purpose. A lot of the flashbacks can also be seen as basic fan service to have all of these past characters/actors pop up, but they're really well-written (as to be expected).<br/><br/>Overall, not necessarily an essential film that was ever needed (unlike the Deadwood movie from earlier this year), but as an epilogue to the Breaking Bad saga, it works well. It's nice to see Aaron Paul doing his usual great work. El Camino is where you find all the answers you've been looking for and get some questions, but in the end there is no better way you can end a beloved show. Hats off!!! To Vince and Aaron for surpassing our expectations. Breaking Bad ForeverðŸ’™ Just perfect. The achieved its goal. They didn't ruin BB and we know what happened to Jesse and he deserves this ending PERIOD. Set after the events after Breaking Bad and follows the story of Jese Pinkman after his captivity in breaking bad.
Vince Gilligan delivers a great movie here, With great acting from everyone, Amazing visuals, Intense and good plot.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a 10/10 because I really loved it, Its as good as I expected it to be. I am happy we got closure on Jesse Pinkmans story. We now have the most perfect ending for the breaking bad series.<br/><br/>In conclusion
This movie is amazing, It lacks nothing in my opinion, Everything is good.
You should all watch it. I loved every minute although it could feel slow sometimes but its still amazing. It has alot of good moments in it. There are several reasons why Breaking Bad was a very good TV show, but never a great one .<br/><br/>The lead characters were the main reason for that ; the guy who played the teacher is arguably the worst actor in recent film making history .<br/><br/>In this movie, the lead is played by an actor who isn't quite as bad, but a close second .
He's actually not an actor at all, but a random guy who pretends to be Ben Foster . Don't like this movie is cheap sorry about every one This is supposed to be a turn around from the series to a movie, a continuation and breaking point, revelation and surprise. Non of that happened, really disappointing, Netflix should be careful not to bring in trash movies. There was no need to extend the series. It was good as where it ended. I didn't get why the name was el camino? Disappointed This film is dull. Very little happens and it really doesn't add much to where BB left off. That said, it is very well acted. I liked Breaking Bad - although I don't think it's a masterpiece, I consider it a well-made series - and I liked the main characters. When I heard about this sequel, I got excited but what got delivered is a Netflixed, just-ok movie with phoned-in writing and acting.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is well done, nice camera work, good music, etc. but it adds nothing substantial to the Breaking Bad story. There were many product placements and endless flashbacks that felt mostly filler. All in all, a watchable movie but nothing more and I don't think anyone on the crew list has much to be proud of in it.<br/><br/>Netflix really became a thing that one doesn't discuss in polite company. This movie would be panned if it were a standalone movie and breaking bad was never a TV show. Theres some action here and there, sure, however the plot is basically jessie holds up in friends house, goes and gets money from abandoned apartment then pays to get a new life. There are so many points in the movie where you can tell Vince Gilligan thought silences ect would mean something to the audience- no. He is the only one that understands the character on the level required to gain anything from most of these (or its poor acting). This means the movie is filled with boring sections not to mention the terrible plotline. I watched breaking bad start to finish yet again prior to watching this and it was all for nothing. I enjoyed watching it again however the movie was only good for finishing off jessies character nicely. It's a shame it was so boring when clearly seeing everything from the government's side would have been more interesting of a movie. It's was poor film and disappointed there is no any editing about jess life Nothing worth mentioning. After an incredible story, i.e. "Breaking Bad", the Movie did not come remotely close to my expectations.
Movie overall, was a waste of my time. Absolutely incredible, exactly what I was hoping for and more Just incredible, the perfect ending to an incredible journey. The journey of jesse for me has now finally ended. It felt like a 2 hour long Breaking Bad Episode
and i loved it
A perfect sequel for the best Show ever made Great finish up and explanation of the life of Jesse and before watching please watch breaking bad and hopefully better call Saul. I really enjoyed seeing how Jesse's story wrapped up. I know some complained it was too long but I thought the 2 hours went by smoothly. Loved loved seeing him get revenge on those welding guys who definitely had it coming. There was the right amount of violence and humor; so great seeing Badger & Skinny Pete again. As u can tell I still love these characters and this world. In all honesty, I would love to see how the White family story played out and how they lived with Walter's legacy.... Nice job Vince! This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is a movie set in the Breaking Bad universe that takes place after the main series of Breaking Bad ends. The movie is a crime thriller that premiered in 2019 on the streaming site of Netflix. Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons, Krysten Ritter, Jonathan Banks, and Bryan Cranston reprise their roles from the television series in this movie. The movie is directed and written by Vince Gilligan and follows Jesse Pinkman as he hides from the law.<br/><br/>El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is a good epilogue for Jesse Pinkman's chapter. Many elements that were present in Jesse Pinkman's life re-emerge in this movie either in flashbacks or when he tries to secure his future. El Camino is completely anchored by Jesse Pinkman with audiences being required to watch Breaking Bad in order to have empathy and follow Jesse's story well. There are many plot elements that Jesse Pinkman knows that are never brought up first in this movie. Almost everything in this movie was something that was already introduced in an episode of Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul's performance anchors the movie completely. Aaron Paul does incredibly well as Jesse Pinkman and he is able to offer a great range of emotion in this movie. The movie frequently flashes back from when Jesse is in captivity to his freedom. Aaron Paul does incredibly well with how he portrays someone imprisoned in the neo-Nazi compound to someone that is required to be one step ahead of law enforcement. Aaron Paul provides the emotional center that the movie utilizes incredibly well.<br/><br/>Any fans of Breaking Bad will enjoy watching the world of Breaking Bad unfold again. The movie brings back Ed Galbraith as the disappearer that was Saul Goodman's contact. The movie's main drive is Jesse finding enough money to utilize the services of the disappearer. In the meantime, Jesse wants to find the money that Todd had stowed away. Jesse Plemons returns as Todd and the two of these characters have interesting moments as flashbacks. The scenes with Todd have a simple purpose but are more drawn out. I was not bothered by this but for casual viewers, they might be sad to see how tedious some of the scenes in El Camino might be.<br/><br/>El Camino's flaw would be that it suffers from being a superfluous movie. Breaking Bad was much more direct with its story elements. El Camino is much slower in its story. There are plot points that take a while to introduce when it becomes clear in the story what the characters are after. The shootout between the autobody employees and Jesse Pinkman was a nice action scene but it felt superfluous. The point was already made that Neil, the autobody owner, wanted to steal all of Todd Alquist's money. Jesse becoming his own man after this felt superfluous as any person that watched Breaking Bad would see that Jesse had made a massive change over the events of the television series.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' to any fans of Breaking Bad that want to see a conclusion to Jesse Pinkman's story.<br/><br/>Grade: A As someone who has never watched Breaking Bad I don't find I feel the same connection to the character Jesse as I'm assuming you would if you've watched the show in its entirety. As a stand-alone fine, if find it neither amazing nor terrible. All around decent film Love the ending as I loved the ending of the Shawshank' Redemption. Reborn. Farewell Jessie. Live a pure life, you earned it. Pretty much knocks it out of the park for something no one expected, and really didn't absolutely need to exist. For fans of the show, and especially for those who have the unforgettable final season seared into their consciousness, it absolutely does not skip a beat. Good movie but not like breaking bad. You say two more episode in breaking bad. El Camino will resonate with every perceptive atom in you if you just give it a chance to take you to, what is objectively, an epic journey to a new start.<br/><br/>The pacing and storyline are absolutely phenomenal. I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie, playing a video game or reading a book. No Heisenberg no Gus , ain't the same , unnecessary movie , better call Saul movie I am waiting for , don't recommend , A solid, if totally unnecessary, epilogue to one of the greatest drama series of all time. Featuring a wealth of cameos from Breaking Bad favourites, El Camino is a well-made fan film that ties up all of the loose ends from the series. It does, however, raise a question of it's own: Just how much did Todd (Jesse Plemons) let himself go since we last saw him? A beautiful near perfect movie in all aspects. Aaron Paul's performance as on the run criminal Jesse Pinkman is beautifully tragic. All other actors give excellent performances as well. The cinematography is gorgeous and expertly done.
Small problems would extend to the fact that Todd very obviously has aged. A another problem is it should have been longer. It is not paced poorly at all in fact the pacing is excellent but I wanted more because the movie is so DAMN good. Breaking Bad was a show that broke the standard storytelling Tv mould and delivered in my opinion, the best Tv show. This film plays out like an Epilogue and is not an essential part of the storyline. When we last left Jesse he was fleeing from the captivity scene and looked promising, but that would not be the case. The film picks up immediately and we are once again in the Breaking Bad world. This film is an incredible addition to the series, and in a world where filmmakers take liberties with storytelling, this actually has a reason to exist. Solid Netflix film and further evidence they are beginning to break the mould on the movie originals. Glad to see Breaking Bad back and another film down the line wouldn't hurt either. Actually, I was doubtful about the movie. I was wondering that it will satisfy to expectation or not because they did very well job at the end of the series. But of course they create a masterpiece like was every single episodes of Breaking Bad. Never will come a production such as Breaking Bad. Respect and thanks for every person in this job. I really don't care how old and fat the actors are. I saw a brilliant story, with a good directing and a good outcome to one of the most interesting character of "Breaking Bad". It's impressive the way how Vince Gilligan writes unpredictable situations, because he talks about minimally intelligent characters. Very nice! This breaking bad movie was about the life of jesse Pinkman after the finale of breaking bad. It was a very good movie with a good finale and i say a 10/10 El Camino is an interesting entry in the Breaking Bad "franchise". Vince Gilligan is back directing and you can definitely feel that. It totally has the same feeling as Breaking Bad does which is achieved by using time lapses, POV shots, and other shot types that Breaking Bad used very often. Aaron Paul gives his best performance to date here and it is a joy to watch. You can really tell that everyone who came back took it just as seriously as they did the show and that they were all excited to be playing those characters again. The script is very well written and very engaging even when nothing extremely interesting is happening. The cinematography is also beautiful and insanely interesting. This does feel like a solid companion piece to Breaking Bad although I do want people to keep their expectations in check. The story here really isn't that necessary and you really wouldn't be missing a ton if you just stopped watching after you finished the show. Don't get me wrong it is really good but I would probably place this close to Better Call Saul where it is filled with quality storytelling, writing, acting, and directing but it won't fill the Breaking Bad sized hole in your heart......if you get what I'm saying. I would HIGHLY recommend both but just keep your expectations in check. I would give El Camino an A-. If you're a Breaking Bad fan who's been aching for more, El Camino does the trick. 8.5/10<br/><br/>Serving as a direct continuation from the series' finale, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie answers a burning question left unanswered for six years: what happened to Jesse Pinkman?<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>El Camino follows Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) directly where the final episode of Breaking Bad left of, with Jesse speeding away from captivity in a red-striped El Camino. Following Walter White's death, the police are in full pursuit. Jesse has a plan to make a getaway, but he'll need help from some old friends, and a whole lot of cash, to pull it off.<br/><br/>This film feels like a direct extension of the series. Despite looking more like a movie than a TV show, the dialogue, photography style, and overall mood perfectly matches. El Camino plays more like an extended episode than an entity separate from the show, and it's beautifully made.<br/><br/>Despite some distracting aging and physical changes, Aaron Paul and the rest of the cast slip right back into their roles as if no time had passed at all. The performances are great all around, and it's a lot of fun to spend time with these characters again. Paul takes on the hardest challenge, not only carrying the lead role, but also being required to portray Jesse in various states throughout the series' timeline. He pulls it off, and then some.<br/><br/>The film heavily relies on flashbacks to drive its present-time narrative, revealing crucial information, and sharing previously unseen moments with other characters that seem to resurface in Jesse's mind. The structure mostly works, but the episodic nature of it all is a little disorienting for the sake of a feature film.<br/><br/>Regardless, the movie never stops being entertaining, with sharply written dialogue and inventive action sequences. Gilligan plays with tension in a very Tarantino-esque fashion, holding you in suspense for minutes at a time and approaching story beats in a roundabout way.<br/><br/>If you're a Breaking Bad fan who's been aching for more, El Camino does the trick. It's existence isn't 100% necessary, but it's essential viewing for fans who want to spend time with these characters one last time and get proper closure for Jesse Pinkman. It's a well made, tense crime thriller topped off with some fan service that will undoubtedly put a smile on your face.<br/><br/>8.5/10 A brilliant ending to the TV series which mainly focuses on Jesse and the various details around his escape. It was nice to watch the sequel from Breaking Bad. This time no episodes but just all put in a two hour movie. Aaron Paul delivered again a strong performance but all the staff made a good job too, After his nightmare Jesse lets all open for a better life adventure in future. Let's see.
7/10 This film adds absolutely zero value to the Breaking Bad franchise. As a matter of fact, it only takes away the integrity of the brilliantly written last episode in season 5, "Felina." It is nearly impossible to end a series in such a perfect manner as Vince Gilligan did, and to see his name on this awkward gimmick of a sequel, well... it just sours the entire experience. He should have left well enough alone, especially considering all of the main actors weigh about 40 pounds more than they did since season 5 aired. I can suspend disbelief for a science teacher-turned-drug-kingpin... I can suspend disbelief for a robotic machine gun that miraculously takes out an entire drug cartel... and now I can even suspend disbelief for a refrigerator full of drug money that the authorities blindly overlook... but what I cannot suspend my disbelief for is that Jesse Plemons is still in his early 20's.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad will always be one of my favorite television series, so I can understand people fiending for more, wanting to see the characters in another adrenaline pumping dilemma just one last time. However, if people were missing the characters that much, they should have just slowly weened themselves off of Breaking Bad by binging the show once again, then heading on over to its equally entertaining spin-off show, Better Call Saul. Stepping into Jimmy McGill's world is a much more satisfying endeavor than witnessing the half-arsed 2 hour long epilogue that is El Camino. El Camino was not a fantastic film, it was however a very good Final episode to Breaking bad we never got first time round. It was a fitting end to Jesse Pinkmans story and Aaron Paul nailed the part yet again.
My star rating may be a bit harsh but i've rated it on the bases that for me it was a long episode, not a film. This 2 hours felt like 30 mins, it was tense, gritty and desperate, all of the reasons Breaking Bad, was enjoyable, if your were a fan of that show, this is a must see, completed the story, or does it ? It is really hard to figure the basic elements of entertainment industry. The classical tradition emphasized upon handsome male and an attractive female, good story, some romance and violance will be good. In a movie such El Camino, the first male role Aaron Paul is not a handsome, athletic, sympatic. In fact he is short, very ordenry person. In the same time there is no female role in this movie! So, what about the classical standards of a good movie? Merely nothing, except the "western shooting scene". I think all the things here in this movie, is about the writter and director, Vince Gilligan, and the distinguish performance of Aaron Paul. In fact Aaron Paul has a distinctive mastry on his face muscles, he didn't count on only on his body in acting as the most actors did, but inded he use the muscle arround his eyas and forhead in distinve manner. And as I can see he can give his roles a lot and I really hope I can see him in another movies. El Camino packs a punch but it is missing its true essence. There isn't much which would keep you on the edge of your seat. Aaron Paul's acting without a doubt is of highest quality but the other characters were lacking in terms of completely nailing their part, mainly because of a weak script or maybe they didn't get enough time to get into their own after six long years. I would have to say enjoyed it but hated the ending( even though I understand it). The plot keeps leaving holes then changing to something else. It felt lost at times and then suddenly fills with a great scene to draw you back in. At least it's better than Better Call Slow!!! Overall, it was a pretty decent movie. I enjoyed it to a certain extent. If the scenes wouldn't be so long and slow and there would be less (or at least shorter) flashbacks, El Camino could have been thrilling. Unfortunately, this was not the case. That kind of pacing worked for Better Call Saul, another BB sequel, but it didn't really work for this movie. Not disappointed, not satisfied either. It's just another episode of the main series that shows what happens to Pinkman after the show ends. not much happens, if you haven't seen the series it will be a very boring nonsense crime movie, but if you like the main series, you will like this too. Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>God, please keep making these, it was so good. I felt like I just was granted a wish to see 2 more episodes of BB. This movie puts you right back into that final scene and keeps the show moving. LOVED IT WHEN WALTER SHOWS UP. I so wished the paramedics saved him somehow but at least he was in it and it made this Perfect. Please Vince Gilligan keep them coming. Aaron Paul was made for this role and his story isnt over. We've all seen Walt's ending to the story. I think Jesse deserved one as well, him being just as important character as Walt. The movie is in my opinion on the same level as the series and hell, I'm giving it a ten. Wow its too amazing yo bitch just watch it up if you don't like it you better watch arrowverse. Where is Walt's money, which Jack has stolen? Will it be a pretext for an "El Camino" sequel? This was a great ending to the saga. It was good to see Jessie got out, after all it was what Walt wanted for him all along Warning! If you haven't watched Breaking Bad and are planning to watch this masterpiece of a TV Show in the future, then you should not be reading this. However, if you are a true fan of the show then prepare yourself for a trip down memory lane that will make you want to rewatch the show all over again.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was a phenomenal project by AMC which captivated millions of people with its style, realism and the portrayal of the fact that all actions have consequences. What's more, unlike many shows it actually had a satisfactory ending. The only question on everyone's mind was: What happened to Jesse? When they announced the development of El Camino, I knew that Vince Gilligan and the team would not just resurface this project for a simple cash grab. I knew they had one last story to tell, a story that would be a true homage to a colossal TV Series.<br/><br/>The most impressive part is of course Aaron Paul who somehow managed to recapture his absolute and utter derangement as if the series has ended last week and not 6 years ago. He showed why he won 3 Emmys back in the day. Despite switching the networks, the movie still maintained the look, feel and atmosphere that we have grown accustomed to.<br/><br/>What I truly loved is that they did not try to cram content and myltiple plotlines for the sake of pouring it all out on the viewer and opening doors for future projects. Instead, they took their time, maintained the standard and used the 2 hours to wrap up loose ends by having a simple, yet interesting plot with plenty of unexpected and pleasant moments that make this into a delightful epilogue to a fascinating story.<br/><br/>Movies.shmovies on Instagram. Left a lot of questions still to where a few characters are. The Jesse story was nice, he deserved something nice after all the things he went through, but I was left a bit disappointed overall. The 2hr running time could've covered a few more aspects, like Walter and Skyler whereabouts. I suppose that there could be a few more films to cover these characters. I was really looking forward to this to see what becomes of Jessie. Just finished it and I really feel like this was nothing special. If you skip flashbacks, all you really have is Jessie moving on with his life. Much of the movie is talking that drags on to long. It was more like a long tv show that was stretched to fit a two hour window. The very end scene doesn't give you anything really. Just sitting there like "Was that it? Two hours of my life I'll never get back!".<br/><br/>Am I saying its the worst thing ever? No. It's just average at best. If you go into this expecting some sort of closure and what not, you won't really get any per say. I almost feel like it was just done to see if the series had any gas left in it. And while I love Jessie, it could have been made better. Watch it if you want, but don't expect much or to be blown away. This is a movie which extends Jesse's journey thereafter.Breaking Bad was really a special show.A memorable one for ages and so were the characters but this film does'nt provide those 'memorable for ages' characters, instead its fully focused on Jesse and his redemption.But i have to say that the cinematography is yet again pitch perfect,the action sequences blow you away.I won't reveal much of the story since its a spoiler free review.But the Strength of El Camino is in its conversations,it sticks to its formula of never letting the viewer distracted throwing everything of all such as action,emotion and humane in all glorious logics and magics. El camino is also special because of a special performance by Aaron Paul and he proves that again that nobody can play Jesse better than him. El camino continues the greatness of Breaking Bad that's all i can say. I was satisfied. 8/10 The movie was such a good epilogue to the rather vague ending of the series, which was open to lots of interpretation.
However, the movie, in itself wasn't such a big deal. The world could have done without it.
But now that it's there, its the same great storywriting and direction by Vince Gilligan that we all have come to miss, and it ties up well with the last episode. It provides as good a noatalgia trail as you would expect, while providing a satisfactory conclusion to the saga. I just hope it ends here, and there is no sequel. Netflix would better of not trying to rude the cash train here. It does mostly close the loop.. but beyond that.. at best, it's a somewhat unsatisfying end.. and more importantly, probably fully unnecessary. With Better Call Saul being on hiatus, Vince did something special for BrBa fans and came out with yet another heart melting story and rekindled all those sweet memories associated with Breaking Bad. With a handful of flashbacks here and there, El Camino takes the viewer back to the unseen sides of Jesse's torturous experience while he was shackled up and captivated in this Neo-nazi imprisonment. He would come back and reclaim the fruit of his long-labored endeavor with the meth kingpin and srarts off a fresh start as Mr. Driscoll. Vince Gilligan fabulously put final touches on this movie and finishes it off brilliantly. Bryan Cranston cameo really was the cream of the crop. He had still his feeling of Mr. White's about himself. All in all, I enjoyed every minute of it. A perfect ending to a perfect series. This movie is definitely not groundbreaking or better than the series, but it could never be. Breaking Bad is one of, if not the greatest TV series of all time. Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul come back together to create the perfect closure for Jessie Pinkman. Was the movie anything out of the ordinary? no. but it didn't need to be the most spectacular movie and most action filled, and it wasn't. that is what made it perfect. They didn't do too much or try too hard, but they did just enough to continue on the reputation of Breaking Bad and still give their fans a final 2 hours of enjoyment and closure to the series once and for all. No real spoilers...Worth the wait.<br/><br/>Went to see Joker in theatre and was very satisfied and saw this film, both fantastic dialogue! Must watch and feel a sense of resolve you did.<br/><br/>Cheers! #BreakingBad El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is an epilogue film to the neo-western series "Breaking Bad". Written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan, it provides a satisfying continuation and conclusion to the series that many fans have craved for a long time.<br/><br/>After escaping from Todd's (Jesse Plemons) uncle's compound, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) once again finds himself on the run from the law. Seeking help from his friends Badger (Matt Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker), Jesse tries to find a way to skip town while at the same time coping with PTSD as a result of his mistreatment at the hands of Todd's gang.<br/><br/>Even though it does not reach the explosive heights of "Felina", "El Camino" gives the series the appropriate send-off it deserves. "Felina" is indeed a tough act to follow, considering it is widely acknowledged as being one of the greatest television finales in history, so I advise keeping your expectations to a reasonable level with this film. Whereas "Felina" focused primarily on bringing Walter White's (Bryan Cranston) story to a close, "El Camino" expands upon Jesse's fate, which was left open-ended. Despite tying up most loose ends, I felt the film had some minor plot holes that would have been worth addressing, nothing too serious, but the more I think about them, the more I wish they had been dealt with by the end.<br/><br/>In terms of production, the film feels like an extended episode of the show, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does seem slightly less cinematic as a result. The trademark cinematography and lurid colour filters return, and even some inside references to Breaking Bad episodes. For all we know, Vince Gilligan could have snuck in several other allusions to other Breaking Bad episodes throughout the movie without us even knowing it.<br/><br/>Aaron Paul is, of course, excellent as Jesse Pinkman, reprising the role that made him a star. He does a superb job of holding our attention as he readjusts to the outside world he had been deprived of for so long. This is a reminder of how great writing and solid acting go hand-in-hand as we feel the love that both Aaron Paul and writer/director Vince Gilligan have poured into the character after all these years.<br/><br/>Overall, I am satisfied with this concluding epilogue to Jesse Pinkman's journey through the meth business and I am happy that a film like this will help to cement the legacy of such an amazing show.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10 In true Vince Gilligan style, a great and proper goodbye to Jessie. Just as Felina was for Walt, this movie was for Jessie. Well written, directed and put together. Enjoyed every second. That is simply breaking bad and nothing's gonna replace it. Originality maintained. Expectations were met. I am highly satisfied.<br/><br/>Humor at inapproriate moments got me once again. It is weird to find myself smiling at Jesse when his impulsivity arises (even if it puts him to danger) coz he's been like a part of my life already and have known his thoughts and personality just like how I've known my friends. Thank you for writing again Vince Gilligan.<br/><br/>Portrayals of the roles were as solid as my love for this show. Aaron, you are the guy yo. No one can play Jesse but you. ADULT JESSE to make it clear in case others would wana see the young Jesse lol.<br/><br/>It's a 10/10 for me. Enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It could have been better but it was still very good 8.5/10 It was very beautiful
Everything is beautiful
You will be amazed
I suggest you see All waht i can to say it's greatness, after 5 years they come back and they give as this movie at that good !! I can't believe that, good for all fans For people that havent watched Breaking Bad series it might be confusing and boring. Movie has many references and characters from the original series so you have to know the characters to fully understand the movie.
Overall for Breaking Bad fans this movie should be awesome but for people that havent watched series not so much. Well, this film is a great movie but I haven't liked it that there was too much focus on the past during his imprisoning, as in present.
That's why it got - 1 point.
The film got a - 1 point again because I would have liked to see more action from the police against Jessie.<br/><br/>But in conclusion this movie is definitely great and it seems like other people think the same :) Meaningless at all, 2 hours of my life have gone wasted. I ff the second half and i rately do, believe you me! Got halfway through, I hate Pinkman more than Skyler. Please, just kill Jesse. I wasnt expecting breaking bad material. But I just couldnt get throught the past 30 minutes. Still waiting to get better but just too much of a slow burn for me. One positive thing was that Jesse's annoying whining voice from breaking bad is less notcieable. Complete waste of time. It isn't really bad, but the movie is completely meaningless and boring. Definitely disappointing. Before watching 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' I was a little worried. The show was so perfect, and wrapped up so masterfully, that I worried adding more on could only do damage. I failed to factor how much of a genius Vince Gilligan is however and am extremely happy to confess I was wrong to have any fears. This movie was incredible.<br/><br/>The nostalgia this movie created for me was amazing. Along the way we meet a lot of characters from the series, either in flashback form or in the present after the events of 'Breaking Bad'. Each and every one of them is crafted so elegantly and given exactly what was needed. Some are long and are given a lot to work with, others we are just given a little snippet of. The little tasters are actually quite brutal because they remind you how incredible those characters were and leave you wanting more. I may have to go back and watch 'Breaking Bad' again after seeing this.<br/><br/>To say 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' is like another 2 hour episode is correct in a way, but I also think it would be failing to do justice to just how good this was. Even though most episodes of 'Breaking Bad' were their own little masterpieces (especially near the end) this still felt like a step up from them. I really loved this film and I'm so glad it was made. If this is the last we hear from the 'Breaking Bad' universe ('Better Call Saul' aside) then it would be a fitting way to end it. Jesse deserved a wrap up after all. GOT fan boys trying hard to ruin the rating of the movies, don't mind their review and just watch jesse pinkman at it's best! All the breaking bad fans are going to love it! If you didn't like the ending because the character of Jesse didn't get tortured like a snitch you wont like this one either. Complete waste of time. Makes it pointless that he threw all the money out the window in the last episode of BB like a punk Well i cant believe how incredibly boring this film is, what a waste of time. I think people were generally expecting too much from this. It's not a mile-a-minute thriller, the ticking clock of Walt's cancer has been removed as the intensity framing device.<br/><br/>It's a footnote, a post-script to the series. It's not Felina Part 2. It's simply a character study to give us closure on "I wonder if Jesse makes it?" As such, it succeeds admirably. It does just enough fan-service to leave us satisfied, but not so much that it detracts from the story or feels forced.<br/><br/>Most importantly, it resolves a major loose end plot without disrupting or demolishing any of the perfection left to us at the end of Felina. There were dozens of possible writing missteps I was worried about that would ruin this perfect canon, but the writers skillfully sidestep all of them. For that I give it an easy 10/10. This is Jessy's finale and details what happened to him after Breaking Bad. What a tragic life this young man has had. Without giving any spoilers I'll say he turns out ok in the end. Firstly I cannot believe the bad reviews I'm seeing here. To the people leaving negative reviews, your whack and you should get back to your crack. You aint no fan's of Jesse Pinkman or BB. This movie is a conclusion to the excellent final of BB. I'm a massive die hard fan, lots of merchandise including the vinyl box set's. Just need some tattoo's and I'm all done. I needed this movie for my sanity, I needed to know what happened to Jesse after escaping. People are expecting BB all over again in an hour and a half. Are you serious? Can't be done! BB was excellent, 10/10. How can you get better than that? You can't. Like I say this movie is a conclusion, nothing more, nothing less. And it was bloody brilliant imo, well thought out and great to have a lot of the BB cast back in it to help it along. I love it and it is a 10/10 for me all the way. Long live Jesse Pinkman, respect to you Vince, great job. This movie is great for his purpose, that is a tribute and redemption to Jesse Pinkman, don't expect too much, the movie doesn't add relevant information, it's just a tribute to Jesse, nothing more, nothing less. To see the characters again made me so happy I watched it once and immediately after watched it again<br/><br/>I can only hope there will be more bonuses like this in the future I'll keep it short.<br/><br/>This is everything I wanted the TV series to end with.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant. And worth the wait. Timing is everything. Have no idea why this was made and it left me thinking . Pointless bang average dross I had never seen breaking bad until this movie was released, then I decided to watch the series before watching the movie, no regrets, I became a real addict so 2 weeks and 5 seasons later I watched the movie and it was great, answered a lot of questions on what happened to Jesse but also provided and action packed ride. If you enjoyed the series you will enjoy this without a doubt I can' understand why there are many ppl complain about it, the movies is the perfect end to the series, seriously the screen play, the storyline and jesse pinkman himself.
I loved it totally and i only wished if it was longer.
Farewell pinkman Brilliant... all we needed... makes me want even more now The fist everyone should be see " Breaking Bad " and then see this movie !
Best quote " You didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special " This movie have no meaning! Really boring and not like an episode from breaking bad series! Intresting follow up. It earns this stars like the serial it earn. I liked this movie and I'm glad they made it. But it's definitely my least favorite installment of the BB franchise. Everybody's acting was amazing. The cinematography was phenomenal. I wasn't expecting to see too much action (that's not what the point of this movie was about), but I still felt like it dragged a bit. The plot was somewhat weak, and there was a lot of long, drawn out scenes, and by the end of the movie all I thought was, it took a 2 hour movie just to have Jesse do basically one thing: Get money and leave.<br/><br/>I could've done without a lot of the flashbacks. While some were necessary for the story, they are ridiculously long, and it just takes away from the story by dropping you into another flashback in the middle of a tense present-time scene. They bore you with slow dialogue and long pauses between character's actions, mostly just to tell you things you already know. Yeah Todd is a bad person, we already established that, but literally half the movie is just him and Jesse bumbling around doing Todd stuff. I don't care about that, I'm here to see Jesse make a new life for himself *after* the ending of BB.<br/><br/>And fat Todd. Seriously, they couldn't have him lose a couple pounds? When they first showed him through the gate at the top of the pit, you could tell he was larger but it seemed like they were trying to cover him up and show as little as possible. Understandable, but then they went ahead and made half the movie about him and owned it. Actually I had quite forgot many small things from the original show. But really it didn't involve all those backstory from the show. Rather it was a great tribute to the show as a perfect ending story for Jesse Pinkman.
People who are thinking it as a revenge story and after watching this saying that it's no good, they really need to understand that it's not your typical action/revenge movie. Rather very similar "type" and very much faithful to the series. Thanks Vince Gilligan for making El Camino for the fans of the greatest tv show ever. Fantastic Movie - Just when they take you off track slightly then 'BAM' - Totally worth it! Picking up where the show ended everyone always wanted to know what happened to Jessie and this movie allowed us to learn more about his last months along with getting a nice farewell and cameos from many of the great Breaking Bad characters. It was great to see Mike, Skinny Pete and Badger again.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was always about Walter White and Jessie was just a side kick that constantly had his life destroyed. El Camino gave Jessie a chance to have his own chapter and opportunity to decide what he was going to do going forward but in Breaking Bad fashion nothing is easy. Very enjoyable and a much better way to end the series. All the "Breaking Bad" fans who thought Jessie would start cooking again, will be disappointed. The film didn't live up to the hype of the acclaimed TV show, yet pretty enjoyable. The movie started just fine, even then Jessie was like fat and old, and the Jessie I remembered was neither.<br/><br/>Then came the useless time fillers of him just sitting and staring for several minutes while some flashback of something meaningless played, with another way too fat character tried to suck more money from the franchise.<br/><br/>You already get the satisfaction that Fat Todd is dead, as well as are the other antagonists, but there had to be a Clint Eastwood scene where Jessie actually faces off with two guys. It was basically uneventful and predictable.<br/><br/>That letter Jessie hands over at the end is Vince Gilligan mailing this movie in. Hard pass if I was you. Vince , you did an amazing job. El camino is an excellent movie, great work on the script and camera. Where was Saul?
Very short Walt, Mike.
Breaking Bad is a solid 10, the gold standard.
This was an ok effort but really nothing great. The movie could have done much more to tie in the meth empire and maybe have some of those bad guys after Jesse.<br/><br/>Still, I hope Vince Gilligan comes up with a new, improved spin off of BB. This movie is exactly what I wanted it to be: A fitting send off to Jesse Pinkman, complete with flashbacks and nostalgia from Breaking Bad. Aaron Paul is the absolute best. Although I did have a problem with some of the characters physical appearances. But overall, this is a beautiful film hat ends Jesse's story in a satisfying way<br/><br/>Final rating: 9.5/10 Yeah the actor ain't dead, but his scales must be... They should have gone rogue one on his ass and digitally put him into the film, fat Todd aside it was a great ending A great two hours, acting is superb. Leaves you wanting more as movies should. Great wrap up from the ending of the series, it's not an Oscar winning movie but it's enjoyable and solid in its plot. I have noticed that the people rating below five don't seem to be the brightest of people<br/><br/>RIP to Robert Forster who died today on the release of the movie. He plays a part in the movie and obviously in the last couple seasons of BB Like the ending of Breaking Bad, El Camino delivers a solid, honest and even "cinematic" outcome to the pained and contemplative Jesse Pinkman. Jessie has always been my favorite Breaking Bad character because of Aaron Paul's brilliant performance, and the fact that he was the only sympathetic character on the show. With that being said, I was excited to watch this move and I'm glad to say it delivered. El Camino was extremely tense, and Aaron Paul puts on a another brilliant performance.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this movie is that it was a little too disjointed. We all know what happened in Breaking Bad, yet this movie insists on throwing in extended flashbacks to events in the show, which makes the movie feel disjointed. I wanted this movie to be its own thing and not use the show as a crutch. Even with its flaws, I'm glad this movie exists, and I'm glad we finally got to see where this wonderful character ended up. Like felina was the story of Walt's. El Camino was the story of Jesse's. One of the best movies of 2019. Action, thriller, emotional all you can watch in this movie. This ending is some what expected, when first hearing about this movie and watching the trailers you think that a lot of action was going to occur. The thing is everyone died prior to it. Not many characters that Jesse would contact and deal with are left. It was definitely a different type of movie and experience but it works perfectly for some of the ideas brought from Breaking Bad; going to Alaska, using the vacuum store, and trying to avoid the cops as much as possible. A lot of the story is based on things that happened but we're never shown during the series. These flashback scene are definitely a nice touch and seeing some old faces was used perfectly. The way a show ends for the most part is something no one will expect. This was not what people thought would happen but it was definitely realistic and makes sense.
I'm glad this movie happened and has been a great experience. So did Breaking Bad fans need this movie? No but it does not disappoint at all. It really felt true to the series. I'm a breaking bad fan and this fits so nicely into it. I was worried this would ruin one of the greatest endings to a tv show ever. But this movie is a great tie in. Check it out for yourself. Starting from the beginning of the to THE end. Venice Really did a great job here by not ruining the end of the tv show but make it even better. Aaron Paul performance as always stunning and memorable. Great movie Warning. Spoilers...
So Walter is dead? And Pinkman lives?
I hoped it would have been the other way around.
Expected a lot more of this movie too.
Happy to see the end. But...
Another sequel could be made.
No one ever saw Walter White being killed. So anything is still possible Great "movie", with what I felt was the perfect pacing of a BB episode if mixed together with Better Call Saul. I could see this being slow for the uninitiated, but as a die-hard BB/BCS fan, even the slower scenes packed more resonance than some big action movies. Flashbacks perfectly enriched the present day situation, and even some of the potentially showier flashbacks (near the end) were not unnecessarily distracting - they served a genuine purpose. This could have gone wrong in so many ways (Walt never died, etc)- but they ended this with what I felt was the only way they could. Its good but not great...slow paced...not thriller but just how pinkman gotta escape from country..just average... I love it, it's great and deep and freaking bold. It's literally like watching the great last episode A perfect ending story of Jesse Pinkman, with a strong direction of Vince Gilligan and a powerful acting by Aaron Paul. I saw some people say that it's not the masterpiece of Breaking Bad or the hype that we believed, and it's true but right because it didn't have to be.
Oh the symbolism in this movie it's brilliant
and,
Yeah, the last 15 minutes are truly well chosen. So thank's to all the cast for making it possible. Really good time with the boys and I will never be able and willing to work hard to make sure you It's amazing I hope we get more breaking bad content This was a very satisfying and overall well written story to wrap up Jessie's character arc. Every bit as dull and unrewarding as the series. I wish I could understand why people liked it, but it's frankly got no redeeming features, aside from being available in HDR, so it at least looks good. This movie is like the 2 final episodes of breaking bad. It's perfect. It van be boring if don't like Jesse, but if his storyline is was interesting you can easly enjoy it It's been a few years since we watched the last episode and we savored every minute of El Camino!! Very smooth ending... We are hoping there is more to come!!! El Camino never really feels like a movie but more of an episode of the cult tv show an I applaud it for that. No need for over the top action or dazzling special effects just good story telling and pacing. Aaron Paul has grown as an actor an it show in his performance. Movie is slow paced an entire two hours .. it feels like they have added two new episodes combined in the climax of breaking bad and the title doesn't really goes with the movie Breaking Bad is one of the best series. But elcamino couldn't catch me. It's a pity that Walter White is dead.<br/><br/>Why did some actors become obese than before? I wish they had a few days before they made the diet !!!!<br/><br/>
Why didn't Jesse shoot his jailer (todd) when he had a gun in the desert?
I understand he was worried about his girlfriend's son, but he could solve it easyl !!!<br/><br/>
Why didn't that villainous get all the money when Jessie found the money in the refrigerator ?<br/><br/>And a few more things you'll find by watching the movie again.<br/><br/>By the way, Jesse eventually took refuge in a place where Heisenberg had gone. and that place, atmosphere, coldness and loneliness had caused Walter madness and confusion. Will Jessie go crazy in alaska? Or he is clever than mr.walter white? Please enter this in goofs correction! It's called a "flash back"! Wake up dude!<br/><br/>"When Jesse goes with Todd to Todd's apartment, it's apparent before breaking into the room Jesse is with the clothes and shaven beard from the future. Once inside his beard and hair and his captivity clothes magically reappear." Great movie, but if they didn't make it as perfect as they did, it could've been a very confusing plotline.<br/><br/>This is a gem, though. Great acting and directing, and is just very well made and watchable. I love breaking bad, but this is an absolute snorefest, two hours of my life wasted waiting for something to happen, I think if it went on any longer there would be a far greater amount of negative reviews, I suspect many of the positive ones have either not seen the film, or are just giving it a good review because of the title. This movie is made for people who have watched Breaking Bad. If you haven't well then do it already.<br/><br/>El Camino is good story about Jesse and what happened to him after the original series. It was such a big relief to see this in netflix after I wondered many years about what happened.<br/><br/>So in conclusion if you watched Breaking Bad just go and watch this and I promise you, you will not be dissapointed. U will be disappointed if u expected too much but overall it is a BB and as a fan u wanted more u want a sequel, promised So finally some closure for Jesse's story arc, that's the problem right there, this film goes nothing beyond tieing the loose ends of a fantastic story, I'm going to be brutally honest here, Breaking bad was one of my all time favorite shows, with Walter's endless grip all the way to Vince's masterclass directing, the characters were something else, it had this feel to it that was so special and there was nothing like it, this film didn't have it, I might be asking too much of this, but If I'm willing to experience the story again, I want it to feel the same.
still, this film serves its purpose wonderfully, and there's nothing wrong with it, it was beautifully shot and acted, it just didn't scratch my itch. Very good movie.
Really good if you have seen the series, otherwise a lot wouldn't make sense. Personally loved it, it was perfect continuence to Jessi's story. I've previously watched 5 seasons (62 episodes) of "Breaking Bad" so I liked this movie. I believe that unless you've followed that series already this movie is going to be confusing for you. Loved it... but imagining someone that didn't see the series already, right? Like say the now seventeen year old that didn't get started on BB when they were nine years old (cause that series ended when they were thirteen years old and, uh, wasn't particularly suitable for children that young. Now... a movie that doesn't make a lot of sense without the context of 62 previous episodes? But one again, I loved it. A small part of me was hoping Walt would have survived... and I wish we would have seen Walt Jr and Skyler. I would have loved to see their reactions to Walt's death. Aaron Paul is an incredible actor and brought so much to the role. Overall, loved it! On it's own El Camino is a nice supplement to the Breaking Bad Universe, but, saying goodbye to Jesse Pinkman right now is not anything significant when you weigh the overall 5 Season run. This film is nice send off to the character but there are way too many thoughts and actions of Jesse Pinkman that are way out of character - if you are expecting this to be delivered as a one last hurrah of the Breaking Bad family, you will be seriously disappointed. El Camino is to Breaking Bad as A Very Brady Renovation is to The Brady Bunch - although most of the cast are reunited, there's really no connection to their 5 Seasons of stories, besides a house. Before Breaking Bad sends Jesse on his way, there needs to be an enormous amount of investment in gap filling and character re-development before we get there. They should have made a movie about Skinny Pete and Badger. That would have been more interesting. The whole story arc with Todd was kind of depressing, too. The only thing that would have made this movie worse was if they had included Skyler White and Walter White, Jr. They should have written a part for Huell. Jesse Pinkman tough guy. Nope. Really wild west!!
The 6 rating because they didn't return back Walter to life. Not that bad lower you expectation. it not a new story its just the end for the second time. This movie is a masterpiece ending of the greatest Series of all times. One reason why I loved Breaking Bad is the attention to details that is also visible in Better Call Saul. This move is not that. I feel this is more like a fanservice cashcow.<br/><br/>When Jessie visited his parents home - why was it? Just to get guns? And is so, that scene has zero importance and he could get the guns from anywhere else. One thing I took from that scene is his brothers birthday used as a PIN. But otherwise very empty scene.<br/><br/>The El Camino, car swapping or the hat given by skinny doesn't play any role. Could not have been there and wouldn't have made any difference. The movie was fun for the followers of the Breaking Bad 👍🏻 This was perfect from start to finish once again.<br/><br/>Take that back. Todd wasn't, but that's besides the point.<br/><br/>Everything else was so telling. Throughout the series of breaking bad it was more focused on Walt with Jesse constantly being put on the back burner. This time we get all of Jesse and so much more. This story needed to be told and Vince could not have put it out there any better. So worth the wait. I personally enjoy this film because it closes off Breaking Bad with a bit of a look into Jesse- I would recommend anyone watch. Thank you for the perfect finale to end Breaking Bad, FELINA was incomplete, and this completes the beautiful crazy story. It makes me sad, but it makes me happy that Saul will take over. We liked this movie and liked knowing what happened to Jesse, however, we were really hoping for closure on Walt's family. After all, they went thru a lot! What happened to Skylar, Walt Jr., Holly, and let's not forget Marie! How have they dealt with what happened?? How have the children managed? Oh, and how about Gretchen and Elliott???? I think they could have somehow added this in the story. Hmmm......maybe one more movie??? More an epilogue than a full-fledged sequel, El Camino picks up right where Breaking Bad signed off and is entirely focused on providing a satisfying closure to Jesse Pinkman's story. While the movie never touches the peak moments of its groundbreaking predecessor, Vince Gilligan's patient direction, Aaron Paul's career-highlight performance & welcome appearances from several breakout characters from the TV series do enough to keep the fans around & invested in its journey. As ruminative as it is entertaining, this final piece of the memorable saga might seem somewhat needless but it aptly closes the book on the greatest TV show of all time. My expectation was perfect. My expectation was perfect. My expectation was perfect. Enjoyable from start to finish with Aaron Paul brilliant as usual. Loved the jumping back to certain parts of the series, which made everything make sense. A great end to a fantastic programme. Beautiful
beautiful
Beautiful in all its events beautiful music beautiful linking past and present beautiful in everything The closure that Jesse Pinkman deserved but didn't got in Breaking Bad. To the legendary series all of us were patiently waiting for the next piece of masterwork from this director/writer and actors in the breaking bad universe. Its finally here and good god its good. Everything from plot, acting, cinematography and the execution of all of those. Perfect piece of art Tough for a movie to follow in the footsteps of a television masterpiece; but I think El Camino" does the Breaking Bad story justice without ruining its legacy. It finally answers the question many Breaking Bad fans had after its conclusion - what the hell happened to Jesse Pinkman?<br/><br/>This follows the events in Jesse's life immediately after the final moments of Breaking Bad's finale. It features a series of flashbacks along the way, to help us gain insight into the motivations of Jesse and the traumas he has experienced.<br/><br/>I thought things were a little slow in parts, but I never found my interest waning. It was easy to slot back back into this world and feel invested in characters. Fans will be happy to see various old favourites and to enjoy that Breaking Bad vibe and feel again.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away; it features a showdown to end all showdowns and an ending sure to please many fans - myself included!<br/><br/>Other highlights included numerous lines from psychopath Todd, played by a fantastic Jesse Plemons:<br/><br/>"You want some soup?"<br/><br/>"Nice, nice lady"<br/><br/>I feel like things have finally been concluded now, and I'm satisfied with what El Camino delivered. Phenomenal performance by Aaron Paul as usual - he really carried the film. Breaking Bad fans shouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'll never hear "Sharing the Night Together" by Dr Hook, quite the same ever again. If you're a fan of Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, this is a perfect encapsulation of Vince Gilligan's work and the crew as a whole.<br/><br/>All of the attention to detail that we've come to expect and love only continues in this stunning masterpiece.<br/><br/>Thank you to everyone who played a part in making this story come to the screen. Gonna have to go back and reread what was written in between the lines. Another reason to love the work of Vince Gilligan.
The last episode always felt like this was going to happen, probably not taking this long.
The continuation going from last episode into this is pretty smooth.
Does feel like a long Breaking Bad episode that's had a lot of money spent on it.
Excellent use of flash backs to add more to the past story.
Doesn't bring back old characters for the hell of it, They all fitted in nicely.
Nice to see Jessie have a bigger ending than he got in the series.
Breaking Bad has a full stop, all be it in pencil probably. Jessie still is a wanted man..... Nice mix of flashbacks, new scenes and brilliant story. It feels like another episode of breaking bad. I'm happy with the films ending and think that it couldn't of gone any better. "Gold Fierro". And. it. sucked. Just like the Fierro. I'm satisfied. So many of the greats leave us so many unanswered questions (Sopranos, anyone?). I feel complete, at ease and, frankly, I won't listen to anyone else's opinion on El Camino but my own. So why I've written this, I don't know.<br/><br/>Basically, if you like Breaking bad and Better Call Saul, you'll probably almost certainly maybe like this. I did. I hope all of these negative reviews get poisoned with ricin. I mean, y'all thought that the movie was gonna be breaking bad. NOTHING can surpass Breaking Bad. But this movie has something special about it. Something that these spoiled brats won't get. For me....... GREAT MOVIE. This is a movie about a fugitive on the run. The script could be easily played by a young Brando. Aaron Paul excels as Jesse, who will stop at nothing to get his freedom. It just plods along, never really reaches any climax, it's ok but could have continued a little longer past the actual ending to establish a final conclusion to what life Jessie actually takes to escape his life of crime. I was waiting for this movie for a long time now, and it is sad to say that I was really disappointed. For me, after watching El Camino, I felt like there was no need to make this movie at all. I was expecting so much more excitement, action and breath taking twists. But alas, never happened. A Perfect Ending For Pinkman Character.I wish it could be more.The Cinematography Was Excellent ,A Fruitful Cameos. After watching it I was really debating I like this film or not, I think I like it more now that I/we know a bit more of what happened to Jesse after the finale of Season 5 and the events afterwards. I also enjoyed the overhead/cinematic shots of the landscapes.<br/><br/>Aaron's acting I was spot on and I don't think you can go wrong with that. I feel they did really well with how it ended.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what else I can say about it other than I think it was a really good film showing the aftermath of Jesse from the S5 and the camera work in the film.... He can't even handle a movie and people compare him with George rr martin. Vince just stop, please Great way how Vince Gilligan told the story after Felina. Loved the flashbacks and special appearances. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad you will love it. This movie could have been a better finale episode. Good to see characters back on screen but few of them doesn't connect you the way they used to and they aren't presented in a good shape as well. The movie had overall great acting, but it had too many flashback scenes and not enough actual substance to the overall story of Jesse Pinkman in the present. That caused the storyline to feel rushed towards the end. It seemed as though the movie would be a little over an hour long without all the flashback scenes I like episode to Mach because jesss we know now what he doing after last season Aaron Paul brings his A-game together with the rest of the cast of this movie.<br/><br/>A show that's a master when it comes to suspense does no wrong here.<br/><br/>This movie didn't need to exist. But it's a proper send off to our Jesse Pinkman. 9/10 Just like watching breaking bad. They didn't disappoint the fans for sure. The worst part, it is when the movie ends. Great movie Vince Guilligan its a great director and writer. You are going to enjoy the movie guarantied. 10/10 El camino is a great film that complements the already perfect ending that had bad breaking Great as an after story movie, I've enjoyd it
But i wonder why they didn't include the interegation of pete in the movie. I have nothing to say much. Breaking Bad was a perfect TV-Show of all time. I enjoyed every episode, author knew what story he needs to tell and made one of the best series of all time. And about El Camino - a perfect sequel. Not many of us get a chance to start fresh,but Pinkman does get the chance. It was dark, humorous and made the perfect ending of Breaking Bad more perfect. Really enjoyed the flow of the movie and the way theose characters brought back to life again DISGRACE TO TV SERIES,WHY DO EVEN THEY HAVE TO DO THIS,I REALLY HATED JESSIE IN THE SHOW BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DISRESPECTFUL,CARELESS,STUPID AND ABOVE ALL UNGRATEFULL TO WALTER FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR HIM Ah man this movie was so good! Jessie is such a good character, everything him about him is so cool. I hope he starts the meth empire up again, he would be a pro at it No idea what the bad reviews are all about. If this film was the last episode of season five, no one who enjoyed the Breaking Bad series would have anywhere near as much negative things to say about it. I had just finished watch the series again and was near the final episode just in time for the movie coming out. So maybe that would be my advice to anyone who hasn't watched it yet and is apprehensive after reading a few bad reviews. So the only negative thing I could say is that I wish it had been the last episode of season 5 or split between 2 and had been filmed back then as you can't help but notice how some of the characters have aged. But in my opinion that's just nit picking. Gets the thumbs up from me! I know that this title is ambiguous or confusing for you. I don't want it to be, but it is the only title that accurately reflects my thoughts: "Perhaps" because I am so unsure about this experience and "Current World" because we are in such a morally ambiguous world which is exactly this world of "El Camino."<br/><br/>I certainly enjoyed Cranston and the the rest of the crew in "Breaking Bad." Like many, I believed that there were some things left unsaid. "El Camino" picks up at that point and I applaud those who want to add this next chapter to the series.<br/><br/>But after this statement of affirmation, I have to explore the key terms of my review title. Let's start with "Perhaps."<br/><br/>"Perhaps" reflects how I have tracked the morally ambiguous world of film starting with my fascination for "film noir" and punctuated by Steve McQueen's character in "The Getaway" (co-starring Ali McGraw) when it showed on TV in the early 1970s. The Motion Picture Code went apesh#t over the bad guy getting away with his crime.<br/><br/>Fast forward 20 years to 1992's Academy Award winning "The Unforgiven" which had the tagline "Deserves got nothin' to do with it." This Clint Eastwood opus bothered me from the first time I saw in the theaters and the numerous times I've watched it since.<br/><br/>Another time jump brings us to "Breaking Bad" in 2008. I understand how film work has a wide range of subject matter and I appreciate this look at we humans in our ambiguous selves. We are neither sinners nor saints. I know this. But I still wrestle with blatant moral ambiguity in art, particularly when art is presented as escapist fare. I believe that is the reason for "Perhaps" in the title: I am wrestling with this morally bankrupt world where I appreciate the honesty of the characterizations but appalled by the depiction of a ant-hero we really believe we should admire.<br/><br/>Which propels me the the latter part of the title, "Current World." We all know the cliche of art replicating life" after watching "El Camino" I could not help but turn the cliche so that we see life replicating art. We are in the world depicted in "El Camino": a world of lies, of deceit, of violence, of greed, of just wanting more for myself and mine.<br/><br/>Trump's world has simply copied from Gilligan's script. If you doubt this assertion, look at the two former Russians who were arrested at the DC airport with one way tickets out of the country and who are acquainted with Rudy Giuliani who is the personal lawyer of Trump! Isn't this story straight from today's "escapist" media?<br/><br/>Aaron Paul is great. The pacing is on target. The surprises in casting are just that. surprises (particularly the last cameo before the credits role). Certainly watch this, but then think about it. What does this film tell us about the world we inhabit today? Are we happy that "Breaking Bad" or "El Camino" is playing out in real time in the White House?<br/><br/>Perhaps you may pause and consider, "perhaps." It is just an amazing movie i really missed all the cast but i wished to see mr. White much more.good job vince go ahead.thank you all. Why Vince? Why?<br/><br/>Hard to tell if this was a plot subdued by the powers at Netflix or Vince really produced a stinker.
The plot could have gone anywhere, but with Jacks crew being massacred by Walts car-boot machine gun and Jesse breaking free, more substance needed to be added to El Camino to enable it to match the pace and brilliance of the BB TV series. Speaking of the Camino? What significance did it play to enable it to become the title? If the car was indeed a character it disappeared after the first 20 minutes.
If i had to bet what happened to Jesse it would be he broke free as shown in the last episode a daze it to a remote area safely, whilst suffering from the effects of PTSD. That's exactly what happened in this 2 hour follow on movie whereas Breaking Bad was anything other than predictable. This movie should have been trimmed down to one special episode. There was so much air time of some characters present past, it almost becomes confusing without paying close attention. I found it middle of the road. 6/10 I went in to it with a cautiously optimistic mind set. Unfortunately wanting to love something isn't enough, it has to offer value of some sort. This movie would have been just fine as a last episode when the wounds were still fresh. However, having waited this long to contribute so little to an already great story was as heartbreaking and infuriating a disappointment as the rapid decline of the quality in the writing of 'The Walking Dead' Season 2.<br/><br/>The 4 stars are for the closure it provided, while uneccesary to make an entire film about it, who doesn't love closure? I've always wanted to know what happened after the last episode of the series. Like if Walter was really dead or not, or what happened to Jesse.<br/><br/>But I could've imagined that what they showed in the movie, wasn't that unpredictable. We kind of knew that he would run off, get some money and change his identidy. Thats why the movie wasn't that necesarry.. And it really wasn't the same. The acting was a bit off and wasn't that natural.<br/><br/>I was expecting a bit more action and thrill like the series gave me. BB really is my favorite show (10/10), seen it like 7x times!<br/><br/>BUT! It was nostalgic to see the caracters for (maybe) the last time. Hopefully "Better Call Saul" will bring us something we don't know yet! Loved it from start to finish!! Seeing Walter and Jessi together I quite literally screamed!! The recap gave me chills, so worth the wait!! Good movie .. In my opinion anything related to the (breaking bad) is worth 10/10 Act and story and direct and Jesse everything in it is very good Breaking bad is the worst and the movie it's like the tv show This movies reads as a well done episode from the series. As I watched, I felt that everything was done meaningfully. It brings together all the characters and give good closure. I've seen infomercials with a better storyline than this movie This was no where close to the series. Plot was not great. They should have not done this movie. The most perfect ending ever to a series!
Most beautiful movie ever! Exactly like Better Call Saul, boring, slow, nothing happen, no character changes or development, no twists, no drama, no story, no plots.. just boring scenes and lazy dialogue to milk money from the franchise.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was completely the opposite of this movie, which is why it was great show, what happened to the creators? why do they have lame spinoffs that hugely disappoints? I am really puzzled.. Way better than Breaking Bad. Not boring at all........ Worst movie ive ever seen breaking bad is the worst series and the movie is worse ! The story not connected together and the big problem they bring white to tell poor conversations with jesi I think bring it last 15 men
4 /10 Finally 2 hours It passed quickly and walter whait in the end I thought he was aliveðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
but the end That's not enough It made me excited for another partðŸ’”ðŸ’” Just like a new episode and the story is expected how he will run away to Alaska
The time wasted is not worthy Donot like
Donot like
Donot like
Donot like
Donot like Wasted 2 hours in which a could have watched Tinelli or Guido Kazka. I love a slow, methodical, developing plot. And I love breaking bad. But this movie was ridiculously boring. Good wrap for Jesse Pinkman, that's it. 1 or 2 good scenes. The rest is boring. Could've been done in 20 mins not a whole movie. I didn't see the point of this movie. I saw just a documentary of Jessie Pinkman persona who tries to get back on his feet. Almost zero action, no mystery, no cooking and no suspense. I wasn't disappointed from the slow motion although I expected some things from the past to be continued like cooking dah!. Seems Netflix made this movie to take advantage the name of breaking bad series franchise and nothing more. Atleast I expect from Netflix to make another movie worthy to watch and put some elements from the past and some characters from past. I putted 5/10 stars only because this movie remind me how good was the breaking bad series and the slowly motion make me solve my insomnia issues that I have. Have you ever felt happy, satisfied and disappointed at the same time? Thats basically what El Camino is. But the point of view is what matters. The way how you experience feelings about this movie depends of how well youre into the Breaking Bad universe and how well do you know it.<br/><br/>It can basically be called two more episodes of Breaking Bad. The movie starts with one of the last scenes of the show when Jessy Pinkman runs away from the place he was held for almost a year. The whole film is mixed, at first with current campaign in which Jessy is trying go back to normal world and start a new life in Alaska but at second we get to see all of the Jessys pain and trauma because of what hes suffered from for the past year. The story is also filled up with the flashbacks of the actions that has happened through all that time.<br/><br/>What I really liked about the movie was being able to go back to Breaking Bad universe even for this short time. The way it was recorded, the way scenes were made, the whole scenario was just Vince Gilligan classic and thats definitely the best thing about this film. The story also was also pretty interesting. Everything was just sticking together.<br/><br/>After the movie was announced I knew that however it would turn up Id love it. The movie wasnt bad but it wasnt great either. Id say most of the bad reviews are caused because movie didnt meet peoples excessive expectations. Many fans thought that movie will be as good as the show but it just wasnt possible. This film is great addition for people who watched Breaking Bad, something to fill the emptiness in your heart for a while. For people not familiar with the show itll be just an average movie without nothing special to offer. Big Breaking Bad fan. Very disappointed. Could have been a 42 min episode instead of "A Breaking Bad Movie". A subpar 42 min episode. Nothing much happens. Don't waste your time. The TV series ended fine. The movie is mainly relying on fan service. There is a lot of flashback and it often brings characters from the series. The vague ending of the series shouldn't have been retouch by this movie, I would have prefer if it was a movie that didn't affect our perception of the series' ending.<br/><br/>To resume it, this movie is not bad, but it is unnecessary And then that fat friendly guy gave Jessie ice cream, and Walter White poisoned Lydia, and the Gus somehow wandered out into the yard while dude was sniping him and missing.... and then Saul Goodman loved to use the massage machine on the floor, then Mike well mike is mike... Soooo what has this got to do with this nonsensical gong show of a movie.. nothing, or was it everything.. This movie is as nonsensical to the memory of Breaking Bad as this movie was. (Translation: This movie sucked, it made no sense it was just a bunch of jumbled images that I posted above). This movie sucks.....<br/><br/>But you know better call the law offices of Jimmy McGill. Not what i ve expected, todd got real fat and it was disturbing and actually nothing happened. They could've just put 1 more episode and it might end. In this film there was to much unimportant crack like past of todd and our guy but we wanted to see the future but actually nothing happened. He mightve start to cook again and build an empire or but yea as i said it was not so overwhelming. Just okay. And if you wanne see some old friends go watch BETTER CALL SAUL it's almost good as bb. I felt in the same way I did 6 - 8 years ago. I am happy as much as like I saw my childhood friends. This movie is the best thing Netflix did. I can't express my feelings anymore. I wish it would be 4-5 hours. It's nothing but the after story of last episode. So considering it as an episode I'll give it a 10. This is the best movie a tv series can produce ever So Aaron Paul comes out and accuses Netflix of "destroying art" haha seeing as how this terrible 5th rate actor is "destroying art" as he can not act to save his life UNLESS you require Overacting and just being the same character as he is in real life. Just a terrible movie that was not needed in any way.<br/><br/>Remember people only watched Breaking Bad for Brian Cranston and NOT Aaron Paul. Anyone could of played his character equally as bad and equally as over emotional.<br/><br/>Port movie and poor script and poor direction. Jessie still crying and wining and bad decision making since the begging. The same as in braking bad. Demons everywhere... He is just annoying all along 6 years after the end of the series and so much rewatches it was the thing that missed . The movie was great directed by vince, SO good actors with top of them starring Aaron paul. It was very good jesse's and ONLY jesse's sequel (for those who ask why skyler or saul didnt inclueded it was this was jesse's story and none else. Very good throwbacks with todd , its good to see that when jesse had a special reletionship with todd whille he's in bars. Also see how todd was such a psycho... real psycho. And we are here in 2 of my ever favorite scenes in the whole movie history, first the walter's throwback who was so emotional, i didnt expected to see it cause it was putted randomly in the movie and in a random timeline it was like jesse was in a hotel room speaking in phone with a lady (jane) and you are so confused and the BAM walt goes out of this hotel room and go eat together, its was so great acting and so sad to see walter knows that his life is gonna end very soon when he started like something so much before he killed jane and wanted to die. The second throwback was in the end when jesse was in alaska driving and started to remember when he was in the car with jane, ill dont say something more but its so good to see them together for one last time. It also had skinny pete and badger jesse's best friends who helped him out and old joe... At the end i was very happy when i show ed (the vacuum guy) and see kinda what was his character looks like (goodbye man we all loved you rest in peace you died at the premiere day) My movie rate 10/10 and the only thing i feel bad for its cause the movie got so much low ratings. Congartulations vince... you did again you freaking genius!!!!!!! Brilliantly told story from the breaking bad franchise! I write this review after having tolerated this boring as hell movie for 90 minutes. After watching the absolute gem of Breaking Bad I was really looking forward to this film and my disappointment is absolutely colossal. This is a slow paced nightmare of a movie in which a whole lot of nothing happened.' There is tension, there is action and it is fun to relive the breaking bad atmosphere again. The movie does not attempt something new or go into depth. There was not really a moral to this story or a very climactic ending, making it seem like a normal episode of the series, but then 2 hours long. Those 2 hours were amusing nevertheless. What a waste of my time. This movie should not have been made. Totally pointless and heaps of gaps in the storyline. Compared to Breaking Bad, this is a complete disappointment. Not sure what's wrong with people who are rating this  8, 9 or 10. Don't bother watching this. You know those reviews that start with: "well, I wish I could get back the (x) hours I just wasted watching this (movie, show)"? Yeah, this is one of those.
I'll start by saying that Breaking Bad was my favorite series EVER. Better than Sopranos, IMO. Better than Six Feet Under. I think Aaron Paul is a solid actor. But
El Camino was a phenomenal waste of time. I watched BB twice: once as it came out streaming after AMC showed it, and once in a huge binge-watch to get me up to speed. But that was a couple of years ago, when Felina came out and blew me away. But since it was a couple of years ago, I had forgotten that Jesse had killed Todd during the finale (Felina. get it?), and that was the ONLY thing that kept me watching. I was wondering how Jesse was going to get away from fat Todd, forgetting that FT had been offed in the BB finale (except he wasn't fat then!). It's a good thing my memory sucks, because I would've quit watching otherwise. And make all the excuses you want about Jesse Plemons needing to gain weight for his part in the Scorcese film, it just did NOT work for this unnecessary and boring and nonsensical movie, because you see Fat Todd in flashbacks. If we were talking about things happening six years later, then it might make sense. So when I saw the lengthy (and everything was lengthy, bloated (Todd: you hear me?) and dragged out) back story with Jesse and Todd, and Todd about 50 lbs heavier than he'd been in Felina, I wrongly assumed that this picked up after Walt had been killed. Fat Todd was a glaring non sequitur that was an insult to every Breaking Bad fan out there. This show would have been better if they had left him out entirely, even though he was the only one who provided anything interesting plot-wise. Never have I ever seen such an impressive epilogue story as 'El Camino'. It all makes sense. The story you didn't know you needed. The acting was top notch and you're sucked into the story as if BB never left.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we humans do tend to age and you as a viewer will notice this from time to time.<br/><br/>Time to watch it again! 10 stars, very good movie.<br/><br/>10 stars, very good movie.<br/><br/>10 stars, very good movie. I gave 10/10 for followings-
(1) As I said in my title my 4 out of 10 goes to Marshal Adam, the cinematographer. He is really amazing !!<br/><br/>(2) This movie is nearly perfect as a sequel(of BB series) and 2 out of 10 for this.<br/><br/>(3) Fantastic Jesse Pinkman (Aron Paul) is worth my 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>(4) No minus points. I'm sorry but if you haven't watched Breaking Bad the series, then I can't imagine any of this making any sense to you. I diligently watched it and even I had some moments that I had forgotten about that didn't jive with what was actually happening on screen. Aaron Paul is an amazing actor, no arguments there. But the movie only answered a couple of questions and again left us with no real ending.
Bad Script for A Breaking Bad Movie. Damn! If you haven't seen the show, don't watch it until you have. If you did like the show, I'd recommend watching the last episode before watching this movie.<br/><br/>Plenty of characters are brought back and make the film feel like a continuation of the series.<br/><br/>Most of the direction is aimed at making it 'look' like a cult movie and it could have benefited with more of a story than just the 'look'.<br/><br/>It certainly does depict the empty feeling of certain parts of America and the production is top class.<br/><br/>I ended with the feeling that Vince Gilligan wanted to write Jessie's story, but the money from a movie took precedence. Camera shots were outstanding and the quality. Story felt a bit dry for a bit but always left me gripping on my seat after wards.This film was made for the fans and to finish Jesse's story and the breaking bad realm.(until the new season of better call saul)
However I felt they should have put more older characters in it to revive memories. Too many people expecting this movie to be like endgame or something where Jesse has to go and single handedly take down the DEA or all of the bad guys. This isn't Disney, it's a breaking bad movie. Its supposed to be realistic yet still having us on the edge of our seats successfully subverting our expectations at almost every corner. This movie does give a satisfying end to Jesse pinkman giving him a well deserved end after everything he's gone through. To all of the retards giving this movie a low rating because walt didn't survive or that their favourite character didn't return are just dumb. If that were the case, the plot would be hysterical as they'd have to shove in a character reference every two seconds isn't that obvious?<br/><br/>And to those moaning about Todd just be glad they didn't use cgi to make him look skinnier. It isn't an excuse to give this movie less than it deserves. They made a 2 hour long movie with the script "jesse is trying to escape the cops ~> and jesse escaped". Like wow, slow claps for the creators. Boring and stretched same as the series.. Atleast series had Bryan Cranston... This has just fatty Jesse running around.. This movie just like the series could have been half the length it actually is... Vince Gilligan has such a habit of stretching things for so long that it becomes boring You got the people that love Breaking Bad and because of that they give this movie a 10, then you got the people that love Breaking Bad and expect Walter coming from the dead, side with Jesse and and expect them to go on a Killing Spree or what ever you want to think of it, and then you got the people that love Breaking Bad, like me and felt for Jesse Character and still give this film a fair rating. Thank you! Omg did I just wake up to what I saw this movie has no class. What's the message  you want to do a movie of redemption I didn't see redemption. Walter white was the charm of the show his nature was Jesse has no class I agree he is the moral compass but no class Walter white was class The beginning is very promising. But as the movie goes on, and all these sub sequences and flashbacks take over for longer than they should. I personally feel the movie loses its tread. Don't get me wrong, it's great to see some more back story with Jesse. What else he truly went through. But after the big "climax" scene at the welding building. And then him in Alaska and it cutting to the title card. I felt like I was only half way in the movie. It felt like there was more to be shown. Being so used to those 45 - 55 minute episode lengths this felt short. This should've been turned into a mini series so more could be explored. More could've been done. I'm still left with questions. Hanks funeral? Walt's Funeral? Walt Jr and Skylar? Marie? And also, what was the deal with Skinny P being in the interrogation room for the teaser trailer, but was never shown in the movie? Or when Jesse was In the El Camino listening to the news broadcast on the radio but in the movie he was in the car Skinny P left for him. Doesn't add up. And part of me wants to think that Vince is hiding a second part to the movie were not expecting. But with how absurd that sounds, I know it's not going to happen.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly,
This movie felt like a forced way for Jesse's end with a bunch of character returns to make viewers more excited. I liked seeing Walt return.. I wanted to see him. But after watching I thought to myself.. Was it necessary? Was any of this necessary? But as a Breaking Bad fanatic I loved it!! Yes it might be an unnecessary film but to me I just loved how it gave us an actual ending for Jesse. Felina was Walt's ending, this was Jesse's ending. Yes the plot of this movie is just him trying to get to Alaska and flashbacks, but I was fine with it. It was simple and realistic, it was pretty damn suspenseful and unpredictable too. I'm gonna miss his character and of course Skinny Pete and Badger. Rest In Peace Robert Forster too, his character was great. On a technical standpoint, this film has amazing cinematography, excellent acting, and beautiful filming locations. It's good to see Jimmy from The Mick again too, I forgot the actor's name I apologize. I love this movie, it's in my top 5 of the year. It was better than Game of Thrones or It Chapter 2 which I thought blew! Breaking Bad fans watch this movie, everyone else you might need to watch breaking bad in order to appreciate this. The fans disappointed, just be happy you get one more breaking bad related thing. El Camino is the utterly forgettable story of what Jesse does after the escape from the biker trash redneck meth heads with frequent flashbacks of the trauma he suffered at the hands of those scum. It plods along like a drunken sloth tripping and bumping into stuff every step of the way. It seems a blatant attempt to still cash in on BB. I am perplexed by all the possitive reviews. While it is cool to see the original characters in the brief segments they appear, which is probably the best aspect of it, spoiler alert.... they're already dead! Just like the show. Loved El Camino. Could only think that Vince G. could now further intertwine Jesse and other present day El Camino characters into present day Better Call Saul characters and story lines. As they say, it ain't over, till it's over. Was SO looking forward to watching this for so long! What a major letdown.
From what was an amazing tv show to an extremely poor movie. Poor casting, did not flow or made any sense. Vince, what were you thinking? I will not recommend this to anyone. Two hours of our lives we will not get back. The atmosphere and the genius touches of Breaking Bad are clearly present in this movie. Vince Gilligan did a wonderful job. I was a bit skeptical as I discovered the release of this movie and feared to be disappointed. This wasn't the case. I loved it!
I just wish Jesse had found all the money hidden by Uncle Sam and his guys. Otherwise all the pieces of the puzzle were magnificiently put together. I think Vince Gilligan could have made a better series spin-off with this story instead of "Better Call Saul" which is a bit boring.<br/><br/>Regarding the negative critics here related to the actors who became older... Guys, on which planet do you live? There is no technical work-around for that yet. Just accept it. This movie was incredible! I didnt know what to expect going in but i was highly pleased with the result. This is a perfect wrap up to Jesse Pinkmans story and Breaking Bad as a whole. The only thing i could ask for now is a follow up to this movie because i want to see more! Wow this movie was pure genius !! Just seeing Jesse in pain at the beginning really shows you how hard he's had it all because walts decision. As a hardcore breaking bad fan seeing Jesse with a happy ending is the most satisfying ending a bit of closure ! It's like a mystery that's been On going for years is finally laid to rest ! Just bad. Everything about it was bad. Overall an outstanding follow up to the breaking bad franchise. Many will be disappointed because it's not of the nature of breaking bad in the way of excellence however this is still an outstanding film. Vince really hit the head of the nail on this one. While the end hints at another film in a sense I can't help but hope there will be one. Overall, El Camino was an amazing follow up to the entire series and really alone is just a great movie. Although after watching I can't help but feel a sense of excitement, simply because I want to know what happens next. Good solid film. A gift for breaking bad fans. Not Oscar worthy or anything but a good finish to the story. "I graduated high school " It's A Very Beautiful Twisted Ending..
The Movie Was A Vince Giligane Creation And Inspiration Master-Piece And A Master Work..
The Movie Was Great And Funy And Deserve 10/10 End Of Talks.. It your a Jesse Pickman fan then El Camino was everything you expected. Over rated. Not much of a story line
I nearly fell asleep watching the movie........... Aaron paul is a great actor without him their would be no breaking bad Loved this "episode" just curious where all the "yeah beotch" went 😝 A bit dissapointed. I liked the fact it gave closure to Jessie's story but lacked the action ive become accustomed to from the creators of breaking bad.
Over all above average and worth watching
J PROS:<br/><br/>Aaron Paul Career Best Performamce<br/><br/>Vince Gilligan's Masterful Direction<br/><br/>Great Supporting Cast<br/><br/>Extremely Suspenseful<br/><br/>Beautiful Cinematography<br/><br/>Effective Use Of Flashbacks<br/><br/>The Perfect Ending Of A Perfect Show<br/><br/>It Has Fan Service (Without Being Too Fan Servicey)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Some Of The Actors Have Aged Since The First One For sure an epilogue worth telling and incredibly suspenseful throughout. The direction is absolutely on point, Vince Gilligan shows yet again that he's got it. Aaron Paul is excellent and effortlessly carries the movie. Jesse Plemons gives a brilliant performance too, as an utterly revolting, deeply believable evil son. Everyone obviously already hated his character in the series, but damn this is yet another level of anger-inducing, and it works so well. El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is two hours of great drama and thrilling tension, and a very good way to fully end the series. Have a question, will this movie be any good to somebody (me) who didn't watch Breaking Bad tv-show? It was great to see some of the BB crew back in action but the movie doesn't have the fast action, high drama and magic that we're accustom to with BB. A little slow paced, some interesting scenes but not worth the 10/10 I gave breaking bad. It's not a movie I'd watch again to be honest. The movie was at most a 7.5, my main problem is that they had to make another loose end of having the welder who helped keep Jesse captive. The thing about Breaking Bad is that it ended with Jesse leaving being the only loose end, and there should not have been any other enemies left except for the police. On the other hand the flashbacks of Todd were amazing because it showed that Jesse was still too scared without Walt by his side (like how he shot Gale with Walt's permission) even though Todd was giving him huge opportunities, like setting him up with money, a car, and a weapon. I also feel like the whole western scene with the welder was weird, and unfortunately that is how they decided to show that Jesse had changed. Ehhh it was a nice ending to Jesse's character but too many poorly placed flashbacks and a ton of boring characters .... I will say this thank God they left out Skylar White's annoying so that was nice. After watching the breaking bad series holding my breath I was really looking forward to this movie. Sadly it was a prolonged pain and I was bored as well. Wish I didn't waste my time but then again I was curious. The director had a long time to figure out and interesting and capturing storyline but the material provided could have been told in half an hour. It leaves me with unsatisfied hunger ;-) I guess Bryan Cranston made the role of Jesse complimentary - he doesn't stand well on his own. As a breaking bad fan i give this movie 10/10
but if you see it as a separate movie its like 6/10 or maybe less Sexy and best movie ever
For me this Is the final
It's just about a man who want to achieve his purpose and fight for them
Walter White was a star in this movie and I must admire that Honestly it's better than what I've expected we got to see Walter white mike todd I was hoping to see saul but it's a good movie worth watching Not much in the story.. slow as always but a real good end for Jesse.. I honestly expected a lot from this movie. It is not bad, but it is also not good. No  Emotions while looking at it. The movie is amazing and it fell like really good ending and Jessi got what he deserved and good work is done by Aaron Paul and very greatlydirected by Vince Gilligan This film has an amazing story to tell with breathtaking visuals and great acting. Just earned it's place in my top 10 favorite films. I wouldn't know... My Friend Philippe hasn't seen it yet. C cool bss. This is a prequel to breaking bad with a lot of flashbacks. It has a modern touch to it and it look gorgeous. Just an amazing movie. Massive fan of Breaking Bad. Have watched this now and will probably watch it again. First viewing I wasn't too convinced about this. All over the place and tough to follow. I feel like this was a weak attempt. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are majorly superier to this. Imo it's just an odd story and should have been better Thank you Vince Gilligan and the whole Team for the best movie (on Video-on-demand) which is ever been produced!<br/><br/>Goosebumps the whole time.<br/><br/>No more comments - 10/10<br/><br/>Yeah B*tch! What a fantastic sequel to breaking bad... Everything about this movie was outstanding at 2hr 2 mins I wanted more and more. Vince gilligan is a genius. The western style shootout is brilliantly put together... Finally Jesse finds peace as he does what he needs to do to escape his former life. Even the small cameo of Walter White put a huge smile on my face.
I would love another and another sequel but happy as it stands
