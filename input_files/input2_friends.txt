Don't watch friends all ten season because than there is nothing left in life to watch There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the  singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes  in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too.  The humor is universal.  I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced.  Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing.  Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny! 'Friends' is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because "everyone likes it" and be "unique", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too. I would have serious doubts about one's sense of humor if I heard that they hated 'Friends'. I've been reading a lot of these comments. Some people don't like the show...claiming it to be unrealistic or that the plot lines get boring.<br/><br/>I didn't discover Friends until a year or two ago (thanks to MY friends) but I ADORE the show in syndication and I hope to own the DVDs. Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL.<br/><br/>Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.<br/><br/>This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS.<br/><br/>We may not all sit in coffee shops, but we all LOVE our friends like they were blood. That's what this show is about. Makes you all warm and fuzzy (and sore from laughing) inside. And as a show: FRIENDS will always be a part of MY family. People are saying that friends is running out of ideas and that the humour is getting dull. Running out of ideas? possibly. Humour getting feeble? absolutely not. In fact it's getting better. OK, so perhaps they're beginning to "pair up" the six of them, but so what. Chandler's sarcasm is still as funny as ever. Monica's quirkiness still works. Phoebe's goofiness still brings about a smile. And Joey,Rachel and Ross are still as funny as they always were. So stop being a bunch of cynics and enjoy the show while it's still on. Everyone says that Seinfield is the greatest show ever. I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show. After seeing every episode of this much loved sitcom i much say that the writers and cast have succeeded in making something that is not only humorous, but also forces you to care about the characters and what happens to them in the future. All six of the friends bring characteristics to the show that make the viewer feel like they know them. Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode.<br/><br/>I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the show at series five but from then on i was hooked.<br/><br/>I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone. My friend recommended this to me.And I am thankful tha he did.At first because of my exams I didn't care much on watching but after the second season it got hold on me.Don't know if it's only me but I was crying after the final season. I cannot remember the amount of times I've sat down and thought "I want to watch a new series on Netflix and start a new film!" And after 5 minutes of watching something new I thought, why bother?!? And switch over to watching friends ðŸ˜‚ easy to watch, great comedy and full of content that's completely original. The more I watch it the more I learn about the characters I grew up with, and how I would respond to certain situations, with or without the overhead laughter in the background. I don't know a single person that hasn't seen this, so if your one of them reading my review, do yourself a favour and grab a glass of wine, or whatever, and prepare for back to back television greatness.
Thank you "Friends" Friends has got to be one of the best Us Sitcom comedys ever. I'll be sad for this programme to end next year in 2004 because the whole team did such a fantastic effort to put everthing into this series. It was such a great programme and i think it will always will be. After 10 seasons the programme comes to it's end. I give this 10 out of 10. I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it.<br/><br/>When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list. It doesn't matter that the show ran from 1994-2004, the humor it had is timeless!<br/><br/>In a perfect world where we could pick a series that could run forever, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would be that show. Notice how different TV networks are still doing re-runs at present time even after it has ended back in '04. You'll find that a new generation of viewers who are watching and loving it are surprised to discover that the cast are quite old already. Nothing could beat it. Friends is an excellent tv show.  All of the actors are excellent!<br/><br/>People are saying they don't understand it, which confuses me. It's great entertainment! Friends are talking and living their life, and you see what goes on.  It's going to be hell when it is finally over! The writers are the best I have seen. How could it be a horrible show when actresses such as Jennifer Aniston have won Golden Globes because of her work in it. No one who has watched this show once can say they did not laugh their ass off at least once during the 30 minute period! There's just no other show that can even hold a candle to what Friends was and is for so many people, I watched the finale episode live and it felt surreal that I would never laugh,cry or yearn for these six characters ever again. I am such a fan of the Friends tv show. The characters are well developed independently and together they play off each other well. Some moments are cheesy while others are funny, while the rest is just very well acted and dialogued by the cast. 
At least give the first season episodes a go, if you still don't like it, don't watch it. But for those who enjoy a well developed multi character show..... Friends is sure to make you laugh and want to get to know each character more. 
Its a television show.... there are bound to be goofs or inconsistencies, no television show has ever ever in the history of tv been 200% perfect. 
I plan on buying the whole series on Blue-Ray soon to add to my dvds. After I completed watching the whole series, I felt so bad like there is nothing else left to watch :')
I really really feel that much sad! Easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history.<br/><br/>Everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally.  However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.<br/><br/>We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.<br/><br/>Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:<br/><br/>Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: <br/><br/>Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:<br/><br/>It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: <br/><br/>Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:<br/><br/>It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:<br/><br/>They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.  It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.<br/><br/>And that's my review. If you want a show that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you, because it IS filled with romance,drama and comedy that is why wherever I go I will NEVER forget that show,those characters and those series. I am unlikely to give good reviews but F.R.I.E.N.D.S really captured my heart!<br/><br/>This show is the BEST show that I EVER watched because: 1.It makes me laugh. 2.Whenever I am lonely I watch the show so that I will be happy again. 3.The actors and actresses portray their characters very well. 4.The stories are unique. 5.The script IS Amazing!<br/><br/>So now that I gave you the reasons why I love it... I now recommend you to watch It! Perfection. An incredibly well crafted show, everything from writing, acting, set, it is all unbelievable. A must watch but I warn u, u will become obsessed with the show. So relatable jokes.. Never seen such show in my lifetime Friends isbso awesome u can binge watch the whole season 5/6 times, and you will still be finding it as funny as you found itnthe first time Even now, 23 years later there is no other tv-show that makes me cry and laugh so hard as friends does. A true masterpiece. FRIENDS is the best sitcom ever made. It is one of the things which made my growing up years special. This is the first TV show I watched and absolutely loved. It taught us friendship, love and loyalty. It has the most adorable characters and one can never get tired of watching reruns. FRIENDS is just pure joy which leaves inside you a warm fuzzy feeling, lifting your spirits and instantly brightening your mood. It is the only show which can make you laugh, cry, fall in love even after all these years. It inspires. The dialogues make me laugh and cry even though I have already watched and heard them countless times. It is timeless. It still feels so difficult to watch the last episode because you do not want it to end. I love this show and I am so sure I will love it even 30years from now. The most beautiful, funny and inspiring show ever. I just wish there were more seasons, though they ended the show as beautifully as possible, I loved the show too much to see it ending. FRIENDS always. :) I'll keep it simple and short. This is the one and only show/movie I gave ''10 out of 10'', and if there was 11 i would gave it 11. Why? Humor in shows and movies evolve, what's funny today, won't be funny tomorrow, and what was funny yesterday, won't be funny today, but the thing with ''Friends'' is that their humor is not predictable in any way as that is case with other shows, and they make you laugh every time you watch them, no matter if you've watched them 100 times or more. It's one of those shows that you can watch with friends, girlfriend or alone. It's also one of those shows that you can watch no matter if you're sad or happy, it'll always make you smile. Simply said, it's THE BEST SHOW EVER MADE! Friends is without a doubt the best American TV show ever to air. It has sad and hilarious storylines and makes you feel the sadness and jot out of any situation. The actors do fantastic and you really feel like you know a part of them by the end of the show. This will be a show I will never forget as I make constant references to the episodes. I wish the show could come back on air because I miss them so much, but I'm glad it got all the fame it did because it deserved it. It's really crazy but I still watch Friends 4 times a week. There is nothing that could cheer me up like this on a full day. The humor, the characters, the details (i see more and more every time - and I've watched every episode A LOT). <br/><br/>I was born in 1992 and the last 4-5 seasons I bought when they just came out. I have them all on DVD. I have the Friends Book. Just missing a 'Frankie says hi' t-shirt to join the collection ;-) I just dissapear in the serie when I watch it. Love it.
BIG CRAZY FAN says bye! X I like the bit where they sit around and drink coffee They are all so lovely, sincere, charming, optimistic and witty in the face of everything in life. These six people, solid and sincere friendship, warm and moving hugs again and again, talk to each other, comfort each other and encourage each other. This kind of friendship is really rare, and the drama is very good. I used to see people talking about Friends all the time but I never got the chance to watch it. One day I was bored as hell so I searched some funny moments of friends and next thing I was watching the first season. More I watched more I fall in love with their chemistry, comedy . Now I am mad about Friends and I know that I will be watching this again and again for the long time.<br/><br/>All episodes are best but I will not watch the last 2 episodes ever because they make me sad to see they are drifting a part. I wish they have shown a clip of them hanging out again with their children and having same fun at the end. Joey doing what he does best chandler throwing his best sarcastic jokes.<br/><br/>However I love friends, My favorites T.V series spot has been filled I am sure that it will never be Replaced. Even after 25 years, Friends still the best sitcom ever.<br/><br/>In 10 seasons Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross and Joey made us laugh, cry, think about life, love, family, friendship ... Amazing cast, characters, directors, and so many guest stars.<br/><br/>A timeless show. I am quoting some body but I totally agree with this - "If I get a wish from a genie someday, I would ask him to erase my memory, so that I can watch Friends again afresh and relish those priceless moments...."<br/><br/>To say that F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a good situation comedy would be a gross understatement of monumental proportions. When you watch friends, you just don't watch it, you live it.<br/><br/>It is not about how perfect you have to make your life.. it is about how every moment , good or bad , together makes life perfect. <br/><br/>No matter what kind of person you are, you can always relate to its story line. Unlike most of the contemporary serials, this one does not have a narrow perspective. There are no fart jokes, no clichÃ©s, no stereotypical bullshit - just original day-to-day incidents and the fun and laughter and quarrels associated with it. There are no jokes for joking sake. And it would blow your mind to think how anyone can create six characters like Chandler Bing, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Phoebe Buffay, Rachel Green and Ross Geller.<br/><br/>Hands down - "best thing ever and not just on TV" Friends hands down is the best sitcom that i ever watched. With complicated yet lovely characters this show took my heart out of my chest. Build by great comedy and incredible story, Friends definitly will make who ever watched it could not get over it. All of the cast was amazing. Matthew Perry as Chandler was one of my favourite. With all of his sarcastic jokes, he always make me laugh out loud. FYI i watched Friends in 2018 so, to be honest i only got 85% of their jokes. However i still enjoy the hell out of it. If i were 40 years old, maybe i could enjoy it even more. Personally I get rid of all my tension,stress when i watch the show. There isn't a single episode i doesn't like.<br/><br/>All the 10 seasons are great. It gives our life back.It shows us that there's lot in this world for living. A must watch.While watching the show i always feel like i wish i have those friends. <br/><br/>I like Chandler very much,especially his "hi5".Joey's "How u doing?",Phoebe's "Smelly Cat".Monica's food,Ross's paleontology classes and Rachel.......I miss all of it and I miss this show a lot.And also the comedy in this goes great season to season.It'll be good if they make a film on it.And that's why its the greatest show ever!!! <br/><br/>Friends'is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece. Suffice it to say that Friends is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the "post-college adolescent phase" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you "settle down" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.<br/><br/>It follows the life of six young people living in New York City from 1994 to 2004, so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale, but the relationship truths never will be. Ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking. Ross' sister Monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school. Rachel has been Monica's friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddy's credit card when the series begins, and is looking for a career in fashion. Chandler, Ross' friend since college, is successful in his budding career in business. Rounding out the group is Joey, not the brightest bulb in the room, who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a TV show. Finally there is Phoebe. Her history with the group doesn't go much past the beginning of the series as she's had a rather Bohemian upbringing that has led to a Bohemian adulthood. Complicating factor as the series begins - Ross' wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman, Ross now and always has had a crush on Rachel who doesn't know he's alive, and Ross' wife discovers she is pregnant by Ross shortly after the separation.<br/><br/>One of the best shows on TV with the most heart and the most laughs. Highly recommended. I turned 30 this year and I watched this series for the first time! Yah that's true.<br/><br/>
I started watching from mid Jan 2020 and completed today the 29th March 2020.
All I can say to the cast and team of F.R.I.E.N.D.S is THANK YOU!<br/><br/>
Thank you for making this gem.
Thank you for giving me 6 new amazing friends.
Thank you for giving me such a wonderful family for life.<br/><br/>
Thank you for showing that being a single mom, being a mom via adoption, being a surrogate mom is all wonderful and normal.
Thank you for making me understand that I must do what I love and love what I do.
Thank you for making me understand that with all the traits of mine, if I'm also kind and beautiful from the inside, then am wonderful, am loved, am accepted, AM ENOUGH.<br/><br/>
Am sad that the series is over and I now understand why so many people are asking for a reunion. Well! Here's another person added to that list.<br/><br/>Team! Thank you once again. You all are loved. FOREVER! Friends is one of those timeless sitcoms that is just as funny watching reruns for the 10th time as it was watching for the first time! Not many shows are just as funny today as they were 15-20 years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows! All 6 characters are almost equally as funny! This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made! This is the first web series i have watched in my life... Whenever i felt depressed or lonely i would watch this show and remember some classic episodes from all the seasons... Can anyone tell me why is it on 8.9 ratings...... Why! Why!!..i used to watch 10 episodes per day ..... Days after days went of and at end last season gets over....knowing that season over... The next day i again opened my laptop to watch... It was just like a habbit to meðŸ˜­ to watch daily... That day i realize... Precious things are limited and why why! Is it at 8.9......best best show ever... I can watch it 3000 times and can't be bored!!! There are lot of TV sitcom I watched till now but this was the best. It's thr best in it's genre. The comedy, story, characters and punchlines are great. The only minus point is sometimes the background story of the character's shown earlier doesn't match with the later one's. But apart from that, it's a must watch TV sitcom ever made. I very much liked the show. My favourite characters were Chandler and Joey. I don't know why but i hated the character of Monika. I started irritation when i see her. Overall it was a good Show. Worth watching ðŸ’“ Brilliant from start to finish, this series is a must watch it has everything you could want in a series and also something you can watch over and over again. Who doesn't want to live with friends? We have common hobbies, enjoy life together, and look forward to the future. When my family makes me angry, I can still find friends to play with. How nice, how envious! Sitcoms are one of the TV contents that are liked by a large section of the viewers. In 1994,David Crane and Marta Kauffman delivered a great treat in the from of FRIENDS. The show was suggested to me by a friend who introduced the world of FRIENDS. A world of comedy, drama, emotions, romance and friendship. The writing is over the top accompanied by a good direction and a great show of acting by the cast.<br/><br/>Overall, in one word- Outstanding and a must watch This show will ever be the best. The characters and the plot and the humor will never die. It will live from generation to generation without getting old.<br/><br/>It has become our tradition to keep it on repeat with its hilarious plot that never seems to get remotely boring even after the millionth replay. Central Perk and the characters are a part of every person now because everyone in real life faces the problems this show discusses, everyone wants this set of friends who would hide a body with you, hold your secrets yet reveal them too in the most hilarious way. This show opens eyes to relationships, to true friendship, to real life issues that will never get old.<br/><br/>Every one of us wishes he's a part of a friendship like theirs and that is in my opinion what makes the show so epic and what will guarantee it remaining on top no matter how many other sitcoms tried to compete. This is the first time I'm writing my views about any movie/series and it does feels to me that this one surely deserves my words as it really helped me during my hard times which I was having lately
I never had expected that nothing but a series of which I had no idea about would me some very good memories
I loved this one a lot
Rachel Monica Phoebe Ross Chandler and my favorite Joey I love them all
I have no long long words or some monologues to describe their impact on me and many others like me
and by the way I completed this one in almost 14 days between (4March - 18 March)
Oops!! Addiction I hear it!!! First of all I must confess that I am not a big fan of TV-series, however "Friends" is an exception for me. Each of the numerous episodes contains a hilarious, funny, kind and sometimes touching story. When you watch "Friends" you forget about your own problems,you get so absorbed in it, that all your bad mood can go away. Besides, some deeds and situations can remind you of your own, and you can learn some very useful lessons. During these 10 seasons I can honestly say that I fell in love with all the characters, not to mention the main melody. I like them with all their different types of character, although each of them (just like each of us) is far from being an ideal. They are so different and interesting in their own way: sophisticated,nice but sometimes stubborn Rachel; charming Monica with her passion for tidiness; kind and a little bit weird Phoebes; not so clever but lovable Joe; shy, but romantic Chandler with his jokes; gentle, but proud Ross who always gets into funny situations. And how many funny and entertaining events passed through! Certainly, it is not a masterpiece of art, but if you want to laugh your head out, to feel the atmosphere of friendship and adventures or simply have a very good time, "Friends" are definitely for you! P.S. The only thing I want to complain about is a little detail. Minsk. People, it is not situated in Siberia or somewhere else in Russia! It is the capital of Belarus and it is a very beautiful and sunny city! FRIENDS is probably the best comedy TV show ever made. Besides from being hilarious and staying that way throughout the 10 seasons (most shows "die" after the first few), it's by no means restricted to humor and, therefore, superficial. The characters are very strongly built, each and every one of them is lovable in a unique way. I've heard many people say they didn't like one or more of the characters, usually Rachel, for being shallow, or Joey, for being... well... stupid. But for me, they were all great, each of them was the irreplaceable part of a whole. I laughed with them, I cried with them, I eagerly awaited the next episode. If I had to name the most important traits of the show, from my perspective, they would be: - the characters (my personal favorites being Chandler and Phoebe)<br/><br/><ul><li>the jokes (oh my God, the jokes!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Chandler (yes, he deserves his own place in this list, the fans know why)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the witty insertion of guest stars (there's no one you'd like to see in the show who doesn't, eventually, drop by)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the true, honest, unbreakable FRIENDSHIP! In conclusion, FRIENDS is one of my favorite shows in history. I've seen it three times and I'd see it again and again. I highly recommend it.</li></ul> Looking back on the run of the TV series "Friends", it is easy to see why it was so popular. The casting gave America six young adults who actually felt like they were our friends. On each episode, after its catchy theme song by The Rembrandts, we got to visit with a cast of such well developed characters who we liked: <br/><br/>Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is the beautiful, yet accessible and funny, girl who became a style setter. The country followed her hairstyles and the drama of her ever-evolving relationship with Ross.<br/><br/>Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) is the nerdy PhD who struggled with the timing of his relationships, managing to marry and divorce before finally getting a shot at the love of his life, Rachel. In my opinion, Aniston and Swimmer were the talents that elevated this show beyond good to great. When you watch their performances, their comic timing is perfect and their characterizations feel true.<br/><br/>Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is Ross' sister and the neurotic neat freak who still bears scars from her younger fat days. Besides some very interesting relationships, she eventually marries another one of the friends. She is hyper-competitive, especially when it comes to games or sports.<br/><br/>Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is the class clown. Could anyone BE any funnier? His bromance with Joey is the center of his life until he falls for Monica.<br/><br/>Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is the clueless actor who knows how to score with women ("How YOU doin'?") and shares his passions for games and "Baywatch" with Chandler.<br/><br/>Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is the kooky folk singer with a penchant for writing odd songs, like "Smelly Cat." She has a twin sister who is also "out there", and an unusual past.<br/><br/>The writers for this show had some great talent to write for, but the writing itself always gave us funny premises, great ongoing gags, and the occasional touching moment. It was always fun to invite them into our homes and experience their trials and celebrations. I try........not too hard, but I try.........to watch other sitcoms and actually try to "hee-hee" and understand the humor, but I can't! Will & Grace, and their annoying "who's your daddy cr@p", Two-Men-And Whatever-And-A-Pizza-Place, ohmigod... give me a friggin' break!<br/><br/>It's not just that there is so much chemistry between the "Friends" cast that the TV could explode, though this is true. Actually, maybe that's the main reason it is as good as it is. What I mean: Although it is a show full of inside jokes that you understand a lot better if you've seen every episode before the one you're watching, it isn't *essential* to have seen any episodes before to start liking it and being hooked instantly. That's how it happened to me.<br/><br/>I didn't start watching until season 4!! But once I did, I thought Rachel Green, Jen Aniston's char, was the coolest, and the cutest character. Now, it's more generic. I especially adore Joey and Chandler of course, and I also like the other three. Each character, except unfortunately for Monica, has grown positively in their own way.<br/><br/>On a sidenote, I really do hope that the "anchor" quality Monica's character used to have can come back a bit in season 7.  Especially as Chandler's fiance/ now, it would be a terrible thing to waste her character on just simple humor they exposed her character to in the last few seasons.<br/><br/>Being a Friends fanatic, allthesame, I wouldn't want this awesome show (especially) to have even the *slightest* chance of wearing out its welcome. As it is, the cast agreed to sign for 2 more seasons(this one and an 8th), and I really hope it can keep up the quality it's always had in these to come. Although I adore Friends, I don't see any reason why they would want to tire a sitcom after these seasons are over. Especially since all 6 are extremely talented actors in their own right.<br/><br/>-----***WATCH FRIENDS EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT, ONLY ON -- NBC -- !!!**----------<br/><br/>Could I *be* any more emphatic?  =) FRIENDS is perfect blend of comedy, romance, quirky dialogues, silliness, jokes and anything else you could. One could never regret watching this.<br/><br/>You can't resist laughing atleast once during the 30 minutes show! far to be its fan, it is not easy to ignore its powerful social impact, result of the simple and precise recipes . it is not easy to not admire the traces of the characters, the dialogue, the smart manner to analyze the Peter Pan syndrome and to discover good performances of the actors who transform a sitcom in cultural phenomenon. Friends has the special gift to transform fiction in situations who becomes so real than the viewer becomes part of the story. and this episode by episode. childish and smart, a film about the friendship and the refuse to grow up, seductive mixture of chaos, humor and thin tension, it is one of the pieces of the revolution of TV industry in the "90's. but the strange fact is the art to be more than proof of the spirit of a period. and this does it irresistible. Friends is on of those timeless sitcoms that is just as funny watching reruns for the 10th time as it was watching for the first time! It's rare when a show is just as funny today as it was when it originally came out 15-20 years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows! All 6 characters are just as funny as the others. This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made! Im not lying to you when i say iv watches the show about 50 times it never gets boring i love this show I remember when i first got the boxset in 2012 i was only 12 and although i found it funny and now that im older i find more things funnier than i have before by watching it more and well ageing and life experience.
I definitely do recommend if you somehow yet haven't watched it but if you're abit of a snowflake i would skip it because its abit old fashioned in its humour yano when humour was actually good and not where people get offended by anything and everything Doesn't matter how many time you watched it. You just keep watching it ,watching it and watching it. There is no single note that describes the greatness of this series Even now I watch friends on Netflix, I actually think I've watched it about 5 times all ten seasons. Before that I watched the DVD box sets. This is the go to program when you need cheering up. When viewing it I know the what's coming up and it still makes me laugh, that's when you know your watching a legendary program. Joey and Chandler are an epic comedy duo especially in the earlier seasons.<br/><br/>My first 10/10 review, this program will live on in my heart forever and I'll still be laughing at it on my death bed. Even though it it has been 15 years since the show ended It still makes us laugh and smile in every episode and even cry in some episodes it got us through hard times and I will always love our friends because they'll be there for me and they'll be there for you. 2020 is starting, and I'm just finishing to see the all episodes, but I can say that forever it will be one of the greatest. Thank U friends for all. It was my first TV show (apart from anime) and initial episodes 3~4 episodes made me feel overrated (not too funny), I had never been so wrong. The characters grow on you, and you would feel they are your personal and close friends too as they go through their daily lives as friends together. I would say one of the best creations by men, and I don't feel exaggerating as this is what everyone who have watched Friends would say. My friend once said, "There are only two people in this world, one who love F.R.I.E.N.D.S and the one who haven't watched yet". I feel its true. You will fall in love but be aware of last episode as it has broken the heart of many people. Just loved it...nothing to say... Really gonna miss those imaginary buddies "Friends" is a sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman that ran from 1994 to 2004 and stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Leblanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. As it almost has become some sort of tradition in the recent years, I always begin the new year with some long running TV show that is supposed to be the highlight of the year. While it has been "Buffy" in 2018 and "Breaking Bad" in 2019, I decided to make this New York City based sitcom the highlight of this year. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect, because it is one of those iconic shows that apparently everyone has watched and liked, but I feared that I could belong to the minority of people that actually dislikes what everyone else praises. Fortunately, I don't belong to those few people. From the first episode on, I fell in love with the show, especially with all the characters and the overall premise and the humour. As a teenager, I grew up with "HIMYM" and thought it was the non plus ultra, but it turns out that it is this show that deserves this title (actually, several plot lines were blatantly copied from "Friends"). You know you found a show for you when you feel comfortable every time you watch an episode and can shut off the brain just for once. Yes, this show definitely felt like home to me and made the last few months something special. What I admire about it is how the six lead characters are equally weighted and equally important to the story. Each and everyone have a masterfully elaborated personality what makes them all so tremendously likable. While I find some of my own character traits in each of them, my favourite character has got to be Chandler Bing. Calling him my favourite character feels like an understatement, he has become my spirit animal with his awkwardness and psychological issues, but also the others had something to them that made me love them so much. The adventures they experienced together were all uniquely funny and hilarious and there were only a few episodes and storylines that I disliked (flashback episodes and the relationship of Joey and Rachel, to name a few), but there was never an episode that didn't make me laugh at least once. It also worth to mention that the quality of the seasons never decreased immensely and were always highly entertaining, even if I think that the earlier seasons are better than the last. If there is one thing, I cannot tell what my favourite episode is. There were so many great and outstanding, I just can't decide. All in all, this show has brought me a lot of joy in the last few months, it made me laugh, it made me cry and filled me with joy and made me feel like home. They have been there for me when the rain started to pour and made so many rainy days feel like sunshine. After finishing the last episode, I felt empty and only good shows make feel this. In other words, thank you, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross for being there for me. Can't even express enough how much this show means to me. Central Perk became a second home, and this is all I can probably say. Iconic and brilliant. If you are in depression go watch FRIENDS.
If your with friends watch FRIENDS along with friends.
It will teach you how to respect friendship, how you can love someone, how you can keepup with your friends without hurting eachother. Sitcom, as the name implies, is a comedy. However, in the ten seasons, more than one scene made me cry. Although what brought the audience more was laughter, it seemed that more profound feelings and truths were also deeply imprinted in the hearts of the audience. The strength of this series is in its characters. The actors and writing inject a lot of personality into them. We feel like we know them personally and we follow them across the course of the episodes and their overall arcs. A very funny series, I will feel sad when the show ends This show, is one of the only shows, that is so funny, and not only on the first time, but also on the second time, third, etc.
The characters are so incredible, you just love them all. The acting is great. This is a show that stands the test of time. I might be biased since I grew up watching this show but it's a comfort show for me and I think it's amazing. It has gotten a lot of hype over the years which is noticeable even more recently, but I think it deserves it. Although it needed some more diversity, it's consistent discussion and representation of sexuality definitely needs to be acknowledged. Aside from the poor jokes made by characters at times, the representation of different sexualities and showing a character who was transgender in the 90s is really wonderful. Masterpiece awesome
Creat wonderland make u wish to live there life Because my mother tongue is not English, so I tried to learn English through watching this serial when I was in grades 9. However, with time passed, I gave up learning English while became absorbed in the jokes in the serialðŸ™ƒ. It's not funny because I failed my English test.... But I have to say that I was not able to say goodbye to them when I knew that I had finished watching whole of the serials and had to say goodbye to Ross, Monica, Joey....
They are the people who growers up with me, too. They were all like my friends! And in watching this serial, our people who live in the opposite side on the earth can delineate a picture of America. Where or not it's true, I promise it's idealistic.
After finishing watching the serial, I also tried to watch The Big Bang Theory but I couldn't find the similar feeling through it.
Though I am? mature now and haven't watched the serial now, it is still something sweet I'm my memory. Thank you all of the cast and the great director. I grew up watching friends a lot and I'll never skip an opportunity to watch it again. I used to binge this show till midnight and even if I miss half an episode, I still watch it anyway on t.v. cause it's too good. The characters are original, creative and super funny. My favorites in the show are Chandler and Joey. The perfect duo. What I love so much about "friends" is the simple story of six friends in new York hanging out, sometimes the story continues for a few episodes and sometimes each episode is dependent on its own. It's not like any other TV show that has a big plot that goes for seasons over seasons. It's basically a simple plot of a comedy show, it doesn't have to be revolutionary, and yet still, people love "friends" and remember it till today. I'll always love it for sure. It's so real that I find that the fascinating world in the play is actually my life itself. In short, it makes people fall in love with everything in life, love suffering and embrace mediocrity. Because you are so determined, no matter what kind of difficulties you face, there are people who will give you support and help. They will put you on the side of your mess when you are in love and vomiting. When you are in a tight corner, try to lend money to you without hurting your self-esteem, to help you get back to work and make complaints about your favorite things. You know they will be there when you are the worst, they will be when you are the happiest, you will tell jokes and drink coffee every day, as if you will pass away unconsciously all your life. Friends is one of the best sitcom of all time without a doubt. A must watch. It's a mood refresher. One will forget all the tensions around by watching this. Whatta series it is unbelievable back in 1994 with topnotch scripts n portrayals. Epic is the only word can match this. All 6 were simply awesome. Friends is one of those classic sitcoms that can definitely cheer you up whenever you're feeling down. Brilliantly created, well timed. When I first watched it I couldn't understand where it was going as the first season progress I was laughing holding my stomach.<br/><br/>Starting with Monica being a perfectionist at everything and cook and her desire to be a shot caller and everybody will obey her. She is always at competition with her brother Ross as their parents would describe Ross is a medical marvel. She is Always being the party host whether it is a birthday party or funeral or Phoebe or Rachel's baby shower where her games sucked but she won't stop.<br/><br/>Chandler who himself had commitment problems. He was living across the hall from Monica's apartment. He is Always looking for something wrong in the girls he dated. Chandler's comic timing was amazingly beautiful. His one liners to less confidence at asking girls out, as a result he is always using Janice as a safty net and breaking up with her the next day. Eventually he overcame his parents divorce which he always claimed why he was bad at relationships ultimately married Monica and they adopted a pair of twins.<br/><br/>Rachel is the dream queen of every man she ever met. A Confident and beautiful woman who spend almost quarter of the show as a waitress at Central Perk in which she clearly bad at after leaving her to be wealthy groom at the alter and Monica took her in as her roommate more like she shoved herself in Monica's life. She turned from being a spoiled girl to working at Ralph Lauren and also had a baby with Ross who is geekest person in the group. He is a sweet natured paleontologist and always correcting everyone's grammar. He always has a crush on Rachel since he was a teenager. He became friends with Chandler in collage. He had a so-called knack for music, which he wanted to play at his sister's wedding and in a episode at the coffee house.<br/><br/>Phoebe is unique character in her own way. She is hippie like and superstitious. She is always using her adopted mother's suicide as an excuse to get her way and sometimes helping poor in need. She plays guitar at the cafe and always coming up with songs that are forced rhymes. She has a twin sister Ursula who most of the time forgets that Phoebe is her sister. She is like the evil counterpart. She married Mark after she realised she wanted a marriage and wanted to be a mother. Phoebe is always bragging about her street life and it has been made clear even if Monica is dominating person she can never be pushed over.<br/><br/>Joey is one of those person who doesn't have much going inside his skull except good looks which he is proud of. He has a big appetite especially for pizza or sandwich. He is Italian who doesn't speak Italian and has seven sisters. He is a actor who did a lot of failed theater roles ultimately land a role in TV from where he got kicked out then back again a few seasons later. He is Chandler's roommate and a womanizer constantly having one night stands and then forgetting their names. But He's a always there for the others. Joey never had serious relationship but a few times he did fell in love but they all left him.<br/><br/>There are a few minor characters who were important in their roles like Gunther who was the manager of the cafe where Rachel worked. He had a crush on her but he could never tell her, even when he tried he was outed because something happed and he couldn't approach. Mark was a ramdom guy whose name Joey shouted at the cafe because he told Phoebe that he would bring a friend and they could double date but Phoebe caught his lie. Later Mark apologized and they started dating. Then there was 'ugly naked guy' who lived across the building from Monica's and the six friends would spy on him and catch him doing weird things. Later when he moved out Ross bought his apartment.<br/><br/>Monica's apartment is everyone's most of the time hangout place after the coffee house. All the six characters were perfect in its own unique way. It was more about six individuals love and understanding and always being there for each other. There is a guranteed 5-6 laughter riots in every episode. This show also depicted regular life issues related to job problems, coworker problems, relationship problems, overcoming personal fears. Entire runtime of the characters started at early to mid 20's ending at late 30's where everyone became responsible adults. Except Joey. When I first decided to follow this classic American TV series, I never thought it would accompany me for so long.Ten seasons, 237 episodes, three times so far.Habits are always terrible, watching a long play, it is easy to create an illusion that the characters are around.In fact, it's almost 20 years since the American TV series was launched in 1994, from 1994 to 2004, they went from 20 years old to 30 years old, and 10 years did leave traces on everyone.Aniston is no longer the young rich girl, she married Brad Pitt, divorced, met someone else.She plays a woman who has been in love for seven years but has never married in He is not that into you.Time has climbed up her corner of the eye, appearance has not changed much, but see the years mercilessly deprived her once young that sunshine and look at the look.
The last season is doomed to a lot less laughter, has been aware of the outcome step by step approaching, even when watching the mood of laughter has reduced a few points.It's not just a funny play, as the lyrics say, I'm ll be there for you, it's emotional: family, friendship, love,It does not create the illusion of tenderness to give you a kind of dream paradise as unreal, it really presents a different life.There are jealousy and provocation in friendship, scolding and disputes in love, resentment in kinship, and contradictions in life intertwined.After a misunderstanding and accusations, we will always know that honesty will always make things better, concealment and lies will let you lose everything.But if you get lost, you can count on the warm embrace of a friend. A word come here is sometimes more powerful than a thousand comforting words.You never know when you're going to die, but friendship is always there. There will always be someone who will gently say to you when you are at a loss, "I am ll be there for you", "There will always be someone in your despair when you give up gently holding your hand, said, "Come here", give you a strong hug. ". Even after 16 years of being off the air, I still freaking love this show!! I can watch it over and over again, and never get tired of it! Friends is like having a home. All the characters and script is perfect. Friends is a reference point for me. Never gets old. It's always funny even if you've seen it a thousand times. After ten years of remarkable consistency, Friends takes its rightful place as one of the all-time great comedy shows.<br/><br/>The first season has a distinctly different feel to the rest, with unmistakeable influences from various popular eighties and nineties TV shows (most notably Seinfeld) as the show gradually finds its feet. Seasons 2 and 3 however, are when Friends really comes to life and hits its peak. The blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and engrossing storylines is perfectly balanced during these episodes. The comedic acting of Matthew Perry is glorious and complemented wonderfully by Matt Le Blanc. The Ross and Rachel love story is the highlight of the entire show in my opinion; beautifully written and perfectly executed. David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston produce a level of authenticity not often seen in this kind of show and anyone who thinks Friends is just mindless trash needs to watch season 3, episode 16 and see what these two are capable of.<br/><br/>The show tapers off slightly from Season 4 onwards but remains very strong right to the end. Perry gradually becomes less humorous once Chandler and Monica get together but Schwimmer picks up the slack, morphing into a slapstick God in the later seasons while retaining his ability to create moving scenes when necessary. The finale is excellent and provides a satisfactory ending for all the characters, something that so many long-running shows fail to do.<br/><br/>I have probably seen every episode a minimum of 5 times and I don't regret a second of it. This is the work of Gods.
Soooooooooooooooooooo much better than Big Bang Theory!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>If u down vote this Sebastian then oof things will happen. I like this Series , acting , laughing , watching it makes me feel Good This show it's magic. I've seen this series for 20 years, it's fantastic, A MASTERPIECE OF THE SMALL CINEMA It is just love 10 seasons are less there should have been 100 season Best comedy series of all time. Nothin more to add The characters grow on you,and you would feel they are your personal and close friends too as they go through their daily lives as friends together. I would say one of the best creations by men, and I don't feel exaggerating as this is what everyone who have watched Friends would say. Matt Le Blanc did his best acting till date . David Schwimmer's expressions were good . Matthew Perry's sarcastic comments . Jennifer Aniston's expressions and of course her looks!! Lisa Kudrow's expression were the best and she was somewhat funny !! Courtney cox was great and how the writers started Matthew Perry's and Courtney cox's love story was very interesting !! and of course Matt Le Blanc's expressions and his way of flirting !! The feeling that Friends gives is indescribable. The best I can do to explain it is: warmth, love, and laughter - some of the most important things in life. It is truly rediculous to understand how a sitcom feels so relatable and personal over 15 years since it ended. How the friends in the show feel like our friends. How each moment of happiness for the group is a moment of happiness for the viewer. How each moment of sadness for the group is a moment of sadness for the viewer. This is just testament to the impeccable writing and pitch-perfect performances in the show. Friends is perfect. If you're sad, it'll cheer you up. If you're happy, it'll just make you happier! To dislike Friends would be to have no feelings at all - you have to be truly cold-hearted to not cherish every single moment of the show! I started watching Friends this year and found it hilarious and amazingly written. The writing of the show is flawless. It truly is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. Each character is unique in its own way. The levity in the show is not what you would expect.<br/><br/>Joey is the funniest character and his quirks and funny one liners never get old. He taught me to always have a humorous mind set in life and to not worry about what other people think if I do not understand something. Joey is in many ways the womanizer of the group and does not care too much what other people think and perceive of him. It is strange seeing him on the Joey show without Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica and Phoebe. He was a much better and funnier character on Friends. To be candid, I am not surprised that the Joey show got cancelled after two seasons.<br/><br/>Ross is a character who got funnier over the course of the series. Introduced as a guy who got divorced by his lesbian wife, Ross built up quite a reputation. His relationship with Rachel had its ups and downs, but I always knew they were meant to be together. The writers and producers even teased their relationship in the series premiere. Ross's funniest line of the entire series is undoubtedly "We were on a break".<br/><br/>Chandler is a character who changed and evolved the most. He was introduced as a guy who made sarcastic jokes about literally everything and never wanted to settle down with someone. He underwent a massive change in his life in the sixth season of the show. Season 6 was a major status quo shift for him.<br/><br/>Rachel is a character who was introduced as this spoiled rich girl and slowly became successful and independent. She taught me that it is never too late to grow up and to never give up.<br/><br/>Phoebe taught me to seize the day and savor every moment of life. Introduced as a person who never wanted to settle down with someone, that changed dramatically when she met Mike.<br/><br/>Monica is a character who developed as a character and really found herself in season 5 when she started dating Chandler. I never expected Chandler and Monica to end up together. The phrase "opposites attract" is particularly true for them. Monica taught me to have an open mind and be bold.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Friends has something for everyone. It sheds a light on a variety of issues that are topical today. It is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. It is better than Two and a half men and The Big Bang Theory combined. Every episode is hilarious and makes you happy. For me, it does not decrease in quality nor are there terrible episodes. To be candid, no show can surpass Friends for its hilarity. I watched Friends when it came out way back, and I've watched the odd episode if it was on since, but due to this virus I had the opportunity to watch the full 10 seasons back to back, its still entertaining, made me laugh and made me now think Rachel wasn't that nice a person.
Chandler is my favourite, strange to think he wasn't going to be a main character just a support role how different this show would have been.
I really enjoyed it and the episodes aren't that long so it's not the long haul you would think.
Only bad thing it ended but they did end on a high instead of us ending up with another joey enough said..
Watch it Friends is my absolute favourite TV show of all time - I haven't seen all of the shows out there, but I'm confident I wouldn't enjoy any more than Friends. I have seen every episode over 100 times because I have it on the TV permanently in the house, it's on in the background, it's on when we eat, it's on when we have visitors, Friends is like a piece of furniture in our house and the house feels empty when it's not on the TV. The characters play their roles so well and the show feels very real and you feel as though you are friends with the characters. Friends is good for any mood you are in too, feeling down?, put Friends on, feeling cheerful?, put Friends on, bored?, put Friends on. So many times we think of watching a new TV show in my house but instead we just watch Friends, it's easy to watch, it's always funny, it cheers you up and it never gets old and I will never stop watching this show. If I have to recommend a TV show to anyone, Friends is always my first recommendation. I recommend anyone to see this sitcom, it's the best of all. Even after 14 years you will defiantly enjoy it and love it. The best serie ever 
I watched 4 times and I still enjoy watching it I enjoyed it and loved it very much. There is no show like this at all. Watched it at least 10 times and its impossible to get tired of it They are my friends anymore. I will confess when I watch first episodes I didn't get the feeling. I watch first time on the website after show finished years ago.<br/><br/>Now in 5 years I don't know how many times I watched again. When I don't wan to start a movie I am checking, while I am eating and if I don't need to focus on it.
They are like my friend anymore and I am there are a lot of people sharing the same feeling with me. It is amazing that Friends is still relevant and still being watched all around the world So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br/><br/>Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A<br/><br/>It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br/><br/>When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year<br/><br/><br/><br/>But I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour.<br/><br/>I'll be there for you, like I've been there before.<br/><br/>I'll be there for you, 'cause you're there for me too This is the best of the bestest sitcom in the world. The life of all of the six friends are so amazing and mind blowing. There are no words for them. Hats off.
I highly recommend everyone to see it, especially those with angood sense of humour This is one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and never get bored. "JOEY DONT SHARE FOOD! " I grew up watching Friends. It's a classic comedy, undoubtedly. Every year I back to watch it again and again. My best memories. Take a bow. I just can't wait to watch the reunion... FRIENDS ARE T H E B E S T! Thesituations that are happening to them are so relatable and everyone, at least ones in his life, was in the same situation as characters. We became part of their grope by just watching... REUNION HURRY UP! What can I say? This show is an Utopia, a safe haven for me whenever I feel sad, depressed, frustrated or whatever. For me personally, I fuel and recharge myself while watching it and walk back to life refreshed. One of my favorite shows ever. I love all of them! very happy and warm in it,i think everybody will enjoy this classic TV show,hope they can live in somewhere lovely Friends.<br/><br/>The only show where I can first binge it for 2 weeks and finish it during a summer when I was younger. And the only show where I can sit down and watch one episode for 30 minutes even if I saw it before.<br/><br/>The cast and crew are unbelievable and they gel so well together. What an iconic show they put together and what I great brand they made from the performance of their characters.<br/><br/>This is all-time, all-time. Definitely a favorite show of my life time. Although I have developed as a person and don't care for and align with how they think and act in this show, I still appreciate it for the connectedness and friend(liness) of the show.<br/><br/>Great work cast and crew. To be honest this show made me laugh and cry so hard.The best show of all the time and the reason why I am writing this is that I learnt a lot of things that truely matters i.e. unconditional love,true friendship,sarcasm as well,fun,etc etc etc...
This show make you realise that you are a part of it and there is no going back..
The best thing is that this makes me realise that "Friendship is indeed best thing happen to all of us".

BEST SHOW EVER Love. Knowledge. the motto. Loyalty. Friendship. Life.And all the beauties This is the show I come back to time after time when I'm either not sure what to watch next, or just want to relax with something familiar. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this wonderful show from start to finish over the years. At this point, I can recite certain episodes verbatim--as can many other fans, I'm sure.<br/><br/>If, somehow, you haven't sat down and given this show a fair shake yet, I implore you wait until you have a considerable amount of time on your hands. The hours will fly by without much notice. Which character do you like best in the six-person line? I remember arguing with a classmate before. Because the character I like, but she didn't like it, she attacked each other. Now, I think this question is inherently superfluous, and the argument is even more. Six people, just six characters with different personalities, different infectivity and characteristics, who you like, just like radish and cabbage, each has its own reason. In particular, after I revisited the six-person line for the second time, I found that my favorite character is no longer the same as it was over a year ago, and I felt that the debate was a bit redundant.<br/><br/>Many friends around have seen the six-person walk. In my sophomore 's dormitory, students who had just bought a computer were broadcasting six people in a row. At that time, I went out to work in the school newspaper every day. Every time I heard everyone laughed about a computer and got a stomachache. The voice of the laughter was just noisy, and I just glanced at it, and I saw that the characters inside were not too eye-catching pretty girls and handsome guys (I did n't think she was pretty when I stared at Jennifer Aniston 's posters), and thought the lines were a bit boring . During college, I never spent my time on TV series. This "bad habit" started after work. After work, I go home after work. I do n't like nightlife or socializing. After work, of course, I do n't want to work anymore, so I can watch some comedy and pass the time before I think of six people. I wanted to see what the laughter in the dormitory was for.<br/><br/>So I have always liked it and will still relive it.<br/><br/>"It's been an education,it's been a love affair,it's been the friendship,it's amazing." I think Monica's wedding is very very sadly overshadowed by Rachel (thunder stolen for the second time! :( ). Do u even need a review? It's FRIENDS, it's amazing Loved the entire series. All the characters are absolutely amazing especially Chandler(Mathew Perry) I'm not a big fan of happy innocent humor, nor a fan of rom-com/chick flick types...but Friends is on another level from the standard for any of these simply because of two things: the depth and consistency of the characters, and the writing.<br/><br/>Friends spanned over 10 full seasons, and 236 episodes over 10 years, and sure the earlier seasons were best but that's a heck of a lot of hours to fill with punchlines, jokes and consistent character development.<br/><br/>As we look back, the cast for the main characters was probably as close to perfect as possible. It had gesture comedy (Ross), dry sarcasm (Chandler), it had surrealistic comedy (Phoebe and her absurd shenanigans), it had the dumb likable guy (Joey), it had the pretty but tyrannical female lead (Monica) and it had the hot but bratty girl next door (Rachel). With those actors and that level of writing, shot in pleasant settings that would become legendary (the apartment and the cafe) Friends were surely on their way to little screen immortality. Not to mention a serious, serious cult following that almost immediately sparked and is still going as strong today. Who today has never heard the Janice laugh or her "OMG" line, who has never heard the theme song, who doesn't know Jennifer Aniston ?<br/><br/>Interestingly, Friends followed the stories of 30 somethings so the target audience wasn't so much teenagers or necessarily the younger audience (as is often the case with trendy series) and catered more to the Generation X members who were struggling with the 90s fast paced city life. That same generation that progressively pulled away from old century society and into the new millennium, with all of its novelties: the internet and rapid technological changes. Friends represents that transition in time. A bit like Seinfeld, it highlighted the growing individualism of the standard big city dweller. Series were slowly moving from a family-centric scope in past decades to this: the tumultuous adventures of young single men and women in New York City. Ironically enough, SPOILER: Chandler and Monica transfer from the urban to a suburban setting at the end of the story to bring up their child.<br/><br/>All in all, Friends has a very strong nostalgic grip on countless numbers of viewers, perhaps because it reminds people of a time they considered the golden age in their lives, easier times, times when shows had a certain substance to them. It will always be one of the easiest shows to watch because it ticked all the right boxes: funny, original, a more or less compelling story, lovable characters, and that little extra something that made it not so much addictive but rather just very enjoyable. It didn't rely on crass humor, vulgarity, sexuality or violence, or on being political. It was just a fun ride, nothing more nothing less.<br/><br/>7.5/10. One of the most popular best and breath taking series ever
Comedy humour drama romance love and of course friends.
Its a package full ot these.😍😍 Once you get on the 'FRIENDS' train,you can't get off until you're made to.It is just so captivating and you'll surely be in tears when it ends. This TV show is awesome!
From the very first moment, it addicts you! It has a lot of fun but at the same time it gets serious and sad, when needed!
The actors were brilliant and memorable, even the small roles. Despite its ten cycles, it did never tire its audience.
It was ahead of its time! Friends is the the best show i have seen so far when it comes to comedy. There are many these days but no one has any comparison to this show. I've watched all 10 seasons 3 times. Rachel, Joey, Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Ross Ten spectacular years with 6 'eccentric' people is truly a roller-coaster ride of emotions. From obsessive hygiene freaks and chefs, to a hungry stupid guy, a paleontologist that acts like a child 70% of the time, an unsure man that has gay parents. A crazy orphan with a twin sister and just a girl that used to be ugly and have a long pointy nose. That's it. A Cafe and 3 apartments in New York City and 6 people with incredible on screen chemistry create one of the greatest television series of all time and probably the most hilarious of all.<br/><br/>Friends is mad, funny, shocking, touching and refreshing to audiences. Ten wonderful years just don't seem to be enough. People want more. But every good thing has to end.<br/><br/>"Along with The Simpsons, FRIENDS is one of the greatest broadcasted treasures the world has ever seen" <br/><br/>9.3/10 Its my best show I ever watched after you finishing watching it you will miss it After 7 seasons. I know why people love it so much it not super fun, but it remains at above average every season, every episode and every second,and sometimes it gives you a punch and that is not easy for anyone to remain at a standard level always. Also it shows that every problem in our day to day lives can be solved if we try to think about each other. It is a masterpiece in its own way and I don't praise anyone that easily. You know so. How you doing? It's not a just sit-com. It's an alternative life.<br/><br/>Dude, why do this show need any review? It's more than that. Those who rates low are those who thinks that they are the mature ones, such lousy, cheerful way of living is useless. For those, go get into your busy life.
This show always relates everyone. You can relate to someone.
The jokes, the sarcasm everything used is perfect.
In the beginning you might feel difficult ti get accent or jokes but really keep going on it will take you to the world where you wanted to be. The heaven of friends.
Could have been any better rating than 10/10??!!! When a series still be funny after almost 20 years, this is success. Funny relaxing and with a meaning at the same time. I would die for any of the characters in this show. That is all you need to know. The best tv show of all time. It is genuinely worty to watch. A new view towards friendship. Funny and heart touching This show is everything right about life. If you haven't seen it,, GET TO WATCHING!! If somebody says that Friends is the best TV show ever, my sense of disagreement would be minuscule. Personally for me, Friends is a contender for the best, definitely top 5. Many people do not like sitcoms, but everybody loves this show! There was many copycats afterwards, none of which equalled the original. Twelve years after its cancellation, everyone still treats Friends with the highest honour as they did back in its heyday, which was all ten seasons.<br/><br/>Friends deals with the escapades of six best friends living in New York City. Courtney Cox is excellent as Monica Geller, a chef who is a neat-freak and perfectionist. She was also overweight in her childhood, which is often what people make fun of to her most often. Jennifer Aniston's breakout role was the daddy's little girl Rachel Green. She moves back to the city in the premiere after walking out of her wedding, and she slowly rides up the world of fashion throughout the rest of the series. Lisa Kudrow's best performance she has ever and will ever do is playing the former street-thug-turned hippie, Phoebe Buffay. Phoebe is a masseuse and aspiring musician, who has the saddest backstory, but humour comes out of it in the best ways. Ross Geller is the role I will always see David Schwimmer in. He is Monica's geeky older brother who holds a Ph.D in paleontology. He works at the museum then as a professor at NYU. He marries a lesbian and has a son with her, but she doesn't find out her true sexual nature until sometime after she got pregnant. Matthew Perry plays the hilarious Chandler Bing, who is more subtly funny to the point where people don't get his jokes. He has a weird marketing job he hates, but keeps it due to his talent and multiple raises. Matt LeBlanc plays the group's idiot, Joey Tribbiani. Joey is a talented actor who would have been more successful earlier if not for his stupidity. He loves food and women, but is very well-meaning.<br/><br/>One of the best things that happens in the show is that the characters stay themselves throughout the show and the main characters comprise of just the six of them. It happens all the time where characters change styles. For instance, in Three's Company, the character Chrissy goes from being a beautiful dumb blonde to a very juvenile girl. And the characters in Friends remain played by the same people. I hate when shows change actors. And the pact remains just the six of them, with the opening credits comprising of just our six leads. Nobody comes in and nobody leaves.<br/><br/>All characters are equally involved in their lives in such significant ways throughout the series. Ross has had the hots for Rachel since high school, and they dates sporadically in the series. Chandler and Monica have an affair and eventually get married. More chemistry is shared so smart and so vibrant that makes for great viewing. <br/><br/>Since the characters, consistency, and arcs were so good, it is only natural for it to become so beloved. Whenever I watch it, I feel so darn good! That must be the effects of other people too, given its popularity. <br/><br/>These six friends love each other and I do too. They make each other feel good, and they make me feel good. FRIENDS is an out and out awesome sitcom. You just cannot stop laughing..It has got everything.the sweet romantic moments, the adorable tiffs, the inarticulate desperation and of course the mind blowing and hilariously funny jokes.<br/><br/>Chandler is the guy whom i love the most in the show. He is simply outstanding in his one liners and the sarcasm..Joey just cracks me up. He's like the cool guy with whom everybody loves to hang out with. Even though you know that Rachel is supposed to be with Ross but when Joey falls in love with Rachel, you just cannot stop rooting for joey to be with her. That was really a heartbreaking episode.<br/><br/>The episode where chandler proposes, the one where Rachel and Ross get together for the first time, the one where U2 song was played, were all extremely special episodes. It just broke my heart when the show ended and i cant describe how much i wish that the show would start again. <br/><br/>Its my stress buster..everyday after a long,hard and tiring day at work i come back home and watch an episode of FRIENDS and it all goes away. <br/><br/>I just love FRIENDS and its cast..Each and every episode is a magnum opus. I wish that they could come together one more time and even if they not they have managed to create something out of the ordinary which will remain etched in the viewers hearts for generations to come. The heck u doing here ? go and watch the show already !!!
EDIT: i already miss them , FRIENDS is a masterpiece , don't miss watching this sitcom, am already depressed cuz i finished it :( So, i recently saw Friends for the third time and i must say that this series is still perfect. For me, it's best sitcom i've ever seen. Imagine that you came home after really tough day at work or at school. You just sit on your couch and turn on the TV. Then you start to watch Friends and your day is way more better. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it's some kind of the magic. 
The series is pretty funny, jokes are simple and great. Scriptwriters did awesome job and the whole crew made unforgettable show.
In the end i want to say that everyone needs Friends in their life and that Ross, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, Phoebe and Joey will be in my heart forever. Thanks, thanks for this special show.
And of course Chick and Duck will be in my heart too. I would just like to say to all the people in the world who have never seen friends in the world, WATCH IT!!!<br/><br/>It's a truly classic show<br/><br/>Jawad This show of 6 friends is one way to represent the greatness in friendship and love. Definitely one of the best sitcoms there will be in TV, and not because of the laughs but because of the connection of actors. The way the actors connect in a scene is so positive and cool that makes the scene go smooth. This is definitely one show you could watch with anyone: your family, your gf/bf, and definitely with your friends. Every single detail in the show is so interesting like for example the development of characters. <br/><br/>The characters Rachel Green / Jennifer Aniston Ross Gellar / David Schwimmer Chandler Bing / Matthew Perry Phoebe Buffay / Lisa Kudrow Monica Gellar / Courteney Cox Joey Tribbiani / Matt LeBlanc<br/><br/>THese 6 actors are one of the most hilarious group of actors I've seen in TV and they can prove it by showing u one of their Friends Episodes. Not only funny but attractive actors. This kind of thing doesn't happen everyday, and thats why i think friends is a great show to watch The exclamation mark in the titles explains itself. 10 Years they appeared on the TV Screens as our favorite SIX FRIENDS. To this no sitcom, comes even close to this, in terms of making people laugh. <br/><br/>It is really about how much can make people laugh at your jokes. It's Writing was the best thing I've scene in Comedy sitcoms over the years. How people in general think SEINFELD, Arrested Development, HIMYM, The Office etc are better than this, in terms of logic maybe but in terms of Comedy NO FREAKING WAY! <br/><br/>All Characters were equal. Chandler had the best one-liners in any show ever. I finished watching the whole series in less than 2 weeks. IMO, this is the list of characters from best to well, Excellent, Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, Monica, Rachel. The creativity in Writing was the main thing, to perform in front of live audience was also a challenge but most important was the fact it ran for 10 straight years and never got boring or Lame at any point. <br/><br/>If I had a chance to fulfill any of my dreams I would want to watch it live! i seriously haven't ever seen a show better then this! my English teacher loved it and always talked about it so i decided to give it a shot. i watched the pilot and could tell it would be a good show. i have now seen every single episode! Ross and Rachel are the most perfect couple i have ever seen! i always cry when i watch the episode where they break up :( and the series finale?! i cried the whole time! Monica and chandler and also very cute, i was so upset when they couldn't have a baby. chandler is hilarious, Ross is hot, and joey is so dumb its funny :) i wish the series had gone on longer. there will never be another show like it, and no show will ever come close to it. Friends is one of my favourite TV shows. I have to admit that I hardly watched it at all when it first aired. That maybe because I was still going to elementary school and high school then. After that I began to watch the re-runs, and found it to be very appealing. I was looking for some comedy, and got plenty of it from Friends. I guess the big reason why I didn't want to watch the show at first was because it's so popular (the leads are famous too). The series was very successful in the ratings, consistently ranking in the top ten in the final primetime ratings.<br/><br/>The show's biggest appeal is the humor. You can always count that each episode will have at least a decent amount of humor. Most episodes are just hilarious! After I watched the entire first season I began to care about the characters. The series revolves around a group of friends in the area of Manhattan, New York City, who live together and share living expenses. I'm not going to go into which of the six leads I like the most because I like them all. They all get a chance to shine throughout the show. However, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are definite standouts. They're good in their roles, and are often very funny. Friends also has a memorable cast of supporting characters. I especially liked Monica's and Ross's parents, Rachel's father, Richard, Janice, Rachel's sister Amy, Mike Hannigan, and Phoebe's boyfriend David.<br/><br/>The series starts off strong. In the first few seasons the main relationships form, and there's a good bit of drama too. The middle is probably my favourite part mostly because it's the funniest. And although the show does become a bit repetitive and goofy by the end, I still found it to be very entertaining. In all, there were 10 seasons with 236 episodes. The finale was watched by about 53 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in TV history. Friends has made a large cultural impact, and the Central Perk coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. Repeats of the series continue to air worldwide. Throughout its run, the series won many awards and was nominated for 63 Primetime Emmy Awards.<br/><br/>One of the most important things that makes any story great is the characters, and Friends has six good ones. By the end, I liked the show so much that I didn't want it to end. I now have the DVDs so I can watch it anytime, and often do. Rumours have surfaced of a film. Most of the lead actors expressed interest in starring in the film, but for now the film is just a rumour because nothing's final yet. If you haven't seen Friends yet then don't hesitate to do so. The series has almost universal appeal. There are good reasons why it was so popular. Friends is the best of all the sitcoms. Here in Sweden we're now watching season eight, and it gets better and better and better. I'm really sorry that this series aren't supposed to be longer than 10 seasons...<br/><br/>I think the best joke in the whole series is this:<br/><br/>Monica: "I think we should have a halloween party!" Joey: "Na, it's kinda' silly dress up and pretend you're someone else!" Chandler: "Joey... You're an actor!!!" This show, let me tell you, has been my best friend almost my entire adult life. I was 21 when this came out and have watched and re watched the series so many times, yet I never get sick of it. I always cry when Rachel shows up at the end of the very last episode and says, "She got off the plane." There is a lot on animosity aimed at this show by the younger generation, because I guess that is what the new normal is, abject hate for things you do not agree with. In my opinion, the only television show that was on a regular network, not HBO or Netflix, that is better than this was House. Just a great, great show here, with plenty to see. It's the best sitcom from the nineties, there is nothing more i can say. Even in 2019 it is very funny. A really great show.
Must watch Ah... What do I say thats others haven't said yet. Friends is probably the best sitcom ever. It has everything like drama, comedy and romance. Some scenes had me rolling on the floor, some had me crying. All in all I freaking love this show!!! Even after watching every single episode at least 20 times, I can't get enough if it. My go to series! I just love this show. This is the only show I am so much attached to. I have only created IMDB account just to rate this show. This is a must watch for everyone. It has laughs, tears, joy and everything. I just love it. This is honestly one of the best sit-cons ever. It's the kind of show that you could binge watch in like a week and after you're done with it, you'll want to re-watch all the episodes again. The show itself is just great and I highly recommend. Friends is one of the most amazing tv shows ever made, even nowadays. No tv comedy has been able to be equal in terms of quality, fun and drama, so I gues it's best sitcom out there. <br/><br/>Watch it! You won't regret it. I remember the time when I was watching the first season, it was like my life is just started. and when I finished the last episode of the last season, it was like "a lifespan has ended." joey is full of joy and he is the best. when you watch the last season, you don't want it to end. never seen a comedy series better than F.R.I.E.N.D.S I just make it quick and simple.
Friends is my choice whenever I'm either sad or happy.
It is a big chunk of my life. Friends is simply the best and most wonderful Tv show ever. You can watch any episode anytime that will be always funny and amusing. This comedy is one of the best and that is because the characters are very well written and unique, there's a chemistry between them! Also you never get tired of watching it, i have many friends who never see the same film more than once and ''Friends'' is an exception for all of them. It's amazing the kind of detail the directors and writers put in the show and there's always some little things go by and they're really smart, you know it's not some dumb usual TV-show with idiotic lines. I also admire the fact that there's a continuity in the facts even from the first season to the last one. It's just the funniest show..even their faces are just hilarious. This is probably the best show ever made. It's interesting and funny. There are so many really good jokes to make you laugh. The cast is amazing. Each character has a joke style and you love everyone of them. This is a great show, it gets more exciting with each season. I don't care what episode I watch cause every single "The One with..." is perfect. I can watch it again and again and it's always funny. Never bored of Friends! I want to watch it without a break. Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross they are forever in my heart. This is an unforgettable show. Ireccomend Friends to everyone. You'll all have a good time if you watch it. By far the best sitcom of all time... Friends series had one of the most well built characters on a comedy show and the romantic part in it isn t an obstacle for a dude who hates love stories. Sarcasm is the main characteristic of friends i'm sorry but what is that man on about? Friends IS NOT about whining twentysomethings. If you actually take the time to look, you can see that when they have no love life, no job and have nowhere to go, their friends will always be there for them. i do have to say the program has gone down over the years because they ran out of things to say, and they should have finished it sooner. but friends has been and always will be a master piece. i grew up watching friends, learning from it and stealing the one-liners! the point is, this program is more than just a sucess full show, its about finding good friends, falling in love and never drifting apart. simply uplifling, funny and a damn good watch! ps. they SHOULD NOT be making a show just for joey, that is the most stupid idea ive ever heard of!! FRIENDS is one of my three favorite sitcoms, along with SEINFELD and THE DREW CAREY SHOW. FREINDS reminds me a lot of THE DREW CAREY SHOW because of the great humor and timing. All the jokes are very funny and pulled off teriffically. All the characters are very funny in different ways. Joey is stupid, Pheobe is crazy, Monica is the neat freak, Chandler, Rachel and Ross are somewhere in between. My all-around favorite of the six is Chandler and I think Matthew Perry is hilarious. The three girls (I can't comment for the guys) are gorgeous. This is what all sitcoms should be like. FRIENDS is a genius production, the dialogue between the characters is so well thought of and the jokes are just too funny . Each and every episode made me laugh harder than the other. There's not much to say really, if you're looking for a fun tv program with LOADS of good looking people and funny comments, don't hesitate. Watch it. I don't know what I got from my friends and what I didn't got. But after seeing this... I appreciate whatever I got from them...:) I thought I always hated comedy series and movies. Almost all new comedy series only offer jokes that make me feel ashamed.
I had watched all the series on netflix I was interested in and thought I could try to watch some popular comedy to see what was really fascinating about them.
After a few very bad comedy series I started watching the Friends.<br/><br/>The beginning didn't convince me right away. I hated laughter tracks (live audience). After a few episodes, the audience laughter no longer disturbed at all. I decided to give this series a chance.
The first season is the worst. The characters still seek their places and are slightly different compared to later seasons. But after the first season, everything starts working.
There is all kinds of humor. Something for everybody.<br/><br/>For me, the best humor in the series isn't the numerous jokes but the expressions and gestures of the actors. the acting in this series is awesome.<br/><br/>For example voices and facial expressions:<br/><br/>Bhoebe's drum solo (04-18)
Ross dinosaur tie (03-12)
Ross dino soldier and G.I Joe voices (03-04)<br/><br/>Accidents:<br/><br/>Joey's power saw (03-05)
Chandler's handcuffs (04-03)
Ross learher pants (05-11)<br/><br/>And many other ingenious scenes.<br/><br/>Even though it's a comedy, Friends is the first series to make me tear up. It has beautiful love stories and also annoying relationships. Friends makes you use the full emotional scale.
Before watching the series I would never have thought I would say this. Friends is the best series I've ever watched. It's not full of action and excitement, but every episode makes me in a good mood and smile to myself just when I think of some hilarious scene.<br/><br/>If you have never watched it. Watch it now. And if you aren't sure after the first episodes you like it then keep watching. If at the end of the series you can say you hate it, you are lying.
Because this series is true masterpiece. One of the greatest tv shows of all-time! Seen every episode multiple times. Friends is the best comedy show ever it includes fabulous lines and interesting events it's perfect You can't get bored. I don't think there is anything funnier.
The cast are really really good. Their performance are incredible. ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ Don't thing anything to much..you just watch it..adorable It's not easy to say about this show in few words.
The casting is just perfect.
All the 6 main characters have equal importance.Show is fully funny ..
Lot of Laugh out Loud moment s This show is very funny and can sometimes make you cry. The characters and the scenarios they are put in are the best. This show has many interesting plot points including family, FRIENDS, occupations and relationships. This show handles deaths, births and marriages etc. The finale is very emotional and a perfect ending to the series. Absolutely brilliant!!! Some storylines didn't work for me such as Joey and Rachel's relationship (I think it wasn't that good and it didn't feel right). It is still an amazing show with great guest stars, locations and actors.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend it. I can't stop watching this show again and again. it shows the life. The best sentence for me is that"Life sucks. you gonna love it." that's true.
Look at 2020. So many awful and sad things happened. I wish it can restart 2020. So much touching..i bet everyone will cry once in this show Well this show is everything i could ever ask for, i thought i would never watch a Comedy series, but when i was going through bad phase I decided to give it try.<br/><br/>If u ever read about people during old days during history classes, after working all day they turn to drama to forget their pain and sorrows, this show is like one of them defines the true purpose of entertainment, whether u come home tired from work or u had a rough day or feeling low? Just watch this show, U will forget everything.<br/><br/>The best thing is i started watching this show in 2018, comedy shows of current decade is mostly focused on stuffs like how much "life sucks" or about simply "Depressed guy" and they all targeted on introverts which makes u feel more miserable about life,
But this one is not like that it is stills better than every other show even after 3 decades.<br/><br/>Only thing is plot wise during some epsiode it doens't make sense, only during few times but who cares it's Sitcom Not Drama Friends is my favourite show ever, I've re watched it over and over, I would definitely recommend!! I really loved it , it's amazing, even though I expected a different ending like phoebe marrying joe and they just live all happy but it's amazing and worth watching I love the humor in this series! They did an amazing job making a show with great comedy, pure heart, and real life stories. The cast is beyond perfect and I love that each episode is only 20min. I love all the characters, all the episode. Simply superb. I can watch this series 100 times. Friends is a fantastic way to 'get away from it all' for a bit.  There are times when you don't like one character for something he/she has done or the way the writers chose to go with the ongoing story, but the Friends cast of characters are always close to your heart.  There hasn't been a cast so large that compliments each other so well in the history of TV serials. If by some strange act of God you haven't viewed a few Friends shows, do so. You'll want to see them all. The show is addictive. You see the characters go thru many things in theirs lives that can be sad, but you also see that they do survive it with the help of their friends. It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour.<br/><br/>It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.<br/><br/>It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly. It is truly awful. UGH.... I know I can't be the only person to find this show absolutely retarded! It was incredibly unbelievable and ridiculous even by comedy standards. I liked non of the characters and just hearing the song at the beginning of the show ruined my whole day. If I couldn't reach the remote in time to turn it to ANY other channel I became miserable for the remainder of the day.... I have no clue how this show was loved by many people. The only thing I can thing of is mass hypnosis honestly. Like with other shows like Desperate Housewives when one person says they like it they other will believe they do just to "fit in". I for one do not try to "fit in" and always tell the truth about how I feel about things. As for this show on a scale from 1 to 10 I give it a ZERO. I will never understand the hype for this show. Mundane cast and boring, overused canned comedy. Great show. For those who haven't watched it yet, please watch as you are missing a classic "Friends" is one of the best and classic American TV shows ever produced. It has everything needed in romantic comedy shows. This show is about lives of six friends, three males and three females who live together in a flat in New York city in 90's. This show primarily focuses on friendship between characters rather than romance though characters fall for opposite sex later on. This show has total of ten seasons with each season containing 24 episode. Each episode is of 20 minutes long duration.<br/><br/>Strengths of this show lies in characters portrayed by six lead artists. Each character is unique on its own way. This uniqueness is what makes chemistry between characters memorable and incredible.<br/><br/>People still remember and love this show though this show had ended in 2004 after ten seasons. During the 80's we had shows like Full House and The Cosby Show. Two nice little comedies. Although shows like the ones mentioned were good, there was nothing much at the time that people in their mid-twenties could relate to. Nothing dealing with leaving home for the first time, all relationship matters, unemployment and any other day to day trivial matters we go through. That was until Friends came along. Friends is not only a great laugh, but deals with real day to day tribulations that we go through in life. I saw every episode of this series and at the final episode I felt that void and sadness inside of me because I knew I could never see 'Friends' for the first time ever again. That's how you know a show is really good. The jokes are hilarious and there are some moments that you just have to relive from time to time. I'm not going to waste my time or yours writing a plot summary to open my review of this series because everyone knows how it began and the convoluted paths it has taken within the group of characters is too hard to capture in a few sentences. Friends made millionaires of the cast (each week), saved channel 4 from having to find something to fill about 50 hours of air time each week and will continue to be sold in slightly different DVD box sets for decades to come for reasons I don't totally understand (doesn't every fan have it now?). However I must admit that I don't like it and never really got what made it stand out from all the other undemanding American "cute twentysomethings" sitcoms that clutter the schedules.<br/><br/>The relationships are the key to holding the stories together and it bothered me that I was never really convinced by any of them. The various romances come and go with about as much comic confusion as a whale could barely stomach while everyone cracks jokes and one-liners all the time. Many of these are quite funny but only by sitcom standards  some television shows break moulds and explore new ground (successfully or not) whereas some shows are just very polished and professional genre machines. "Friends" is the latter and just because it does it well doesn't mean it is somehow a television event. The undemanding predictability of the whole thing is probably one reason it was successful; the way it gives people a warm sense of being part of a group of friends may have been another. But for me one of the biggest reasons it work was just how straight an arrow it fired  very safe, very white, very clean, very warm, very American.<br/><br/>The coffee shop is a fine example of what I mean. Despite living upstairs, the friends all like to get together in this comfy, well-lit place, drinking big cups of coffee and laughing together. Sometimes they have jobs, sometimes they don't but if money troubles are experienced then they are temporary and comical. The problems they experience in life are less about loss and pain brought about by their own character failings, and more about leaving their laundry somewhere amusing etc. Of course it is a sitcom and you want all this stuff so, like I said, it is very clean, very safe and so on. Personally I tend to prefer dramas when it comes to television, just because I enjoy depth, I enjoy complexity and I do not think for one minute that life is like "Friends" for anybody, although I can see why viewers clung to its ideal.<br/><br/>The cast are pretty and perform their undemanding stuff well enough to produce bland characters that hopefully all the viewers will like. None of them are actually that good but they are good enough for the genre and the product. Aniston inspired a haircut but not me; she is pretty if you are attracted to safe, bland women  which I suppose a lot of people are. I always found Cox prettier and more able to get a bit of personality into her role and she was better for it. Kudrow was just annoying and was normally on the edge of the group  time (and some well chosen projects) has shown her to actually move past Friends looking best. Schwimmer's neurotic Jew was never going to be original and it wasn't  he works it well but his rather wet, bland performance only works when Aniston matches it. Perry I liked but only because his humour is closer to mine than the others; of course his stuff does get annoying quickly and the fact that he seems unable to do anything else just adds to it. LeBlanc suits sitcom world and at least has had the sense to just stay there (although the idea that his dumb spin-off was ever going to be Frasier is a bit rich).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though; overall this is a fine bit of American sitcom. Why it has done so well I don't really know but if I did I'd be copying it and chasing every dollar I could get. Personally the bland mix of inoffensive humour and unconvincing relationship "drama" just didn't appeal to me but it goes without saying that fans of the genre will love this and, hey, should probably buy yet another box set just to shut people like me up! This show is awful. I don't understand what is wrong with everybody. The only reasonable conclusion that I can come to is that there was some sort of mass hypnosis, whereby everyone was convinced this show was funny. Friends never took any risks, tried anything new, or even attempted to expand the norm. Every week it was the same plot, with some wacky jokes by Phoebe, some moronic jokes by Joey, some boring jokes by Ross and Rachel, some anal retentive jokes by Monica, and some mildly charming jokes by Chandler. I realize, that this inherently is not a bad thing. Not every show is meant to push the boundaries of television. However, if you're going to rest on your laurels, and bring nothing new to the table, you should at least do a damn good job of it. Rarely was any joke a surprise, or was there ever a truly laugh out loud moment.<br/><br/>It was not funny. This show does not deserve an 8.8 average rating. TV does influence society...just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted.  Besides, real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems.<br/><br/>Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living?  NBC just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they're just around Gump's level.  I know a person who makes $100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $2200 a month in rent.  <br/><br/>I'd like to see a show called Phriends, where it's six ugly nobodies in dead-end jobs, living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week...and then the landlord jacks up the rent.  Now THAT I would watch. Greatest sitcom and just TV series in the universe pure and simple Friends had the best cast, the best writers and the best fans. The cast is the greatest ever, Matthew Perry, Courtney Cox, Jennifer Anniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc and David Schwimmer could you ask for a better cast, of course we can't forget about Gunther, the acting was always solid, brilliant and hilarious. Over 10 seasons of material 238 shows and I can't find one bad performance from anyone in the main cast or the extras, that's because Friends was a quality show who did nothing half way, they always gave the audience 100% of them self's and that's why Friends is the greatest show on earth.<br/><br/>Most of the time the comedy was smart and edgy, often crude and immature, everyone loved friends because there was something for everyone. Show about nothing, just six friends hanging around going through life together, slipping up, making mistakes and finding their purpose. The writers David Crane and Martha Kauffman are my heroes for creating the greatest sitcom ever made and it's going to be a long time until a sitcom is made who had as much effect on as many people like Friends did and is still doing. I don't really understand what it is about this show that sticks out as one of the greatest sitcoms in America. I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority when I say this show is boring, with forced comedy, annoying characters and uninspiring stories.<br/><br/>This show does not send any notable or important message to audiences - just delving into the lives of six friends living together, offering no substance, purpose or compelling stories. All you get is goofy jokes, silly mishaps, off-the-wall plots and boring entertainment. Some of my cousins love this show. One would always put this show on during house parties and I've tried to watch and give this show a go. But, this TV series does not click with me, as I've found it extremely unfunny, ludicrous and uninteresting.<br/><br/>I believe the quality of sitcoms peaked in the late 1980s, and it went downhill ever since. It is very unfortunate that Hollywood has continued to dish out shows like "Friends" or worse. And, it is even more unfortunate that some people actually find these shows entertaining.<br/><br/>I'm sure that everybody has different tastes. But, I do believe that, in general, the quality of television has overall declined since the 1990s. Sorry to any fans out there, but "Friends" hit rock bottom for me.<br/><br/>Grade F Oh har har har, this show rules man, oh what a hoot. NOT.<br/><br/>'Friends'...............wow, how incredibly interesting, a sit-com about 'friends'. What a total bore fest.<br/><br/>Like many people who hate/hated this sit-com, I just can not fathom how it was so popular.<br/><br/>All the characters are extremely bland and dull and self centered and.....I could go on and on.<br/><br/>I absolutely hated it when one of these utter morons said a line, which apparently is supposed to be really really funny, and then the canned laughter immediately kicks in after the gag (what gag?).<br/><br/>It is all forced fed to you. You are told to believe this is funny with the assisted canned laughter or fake on cue audience laughter.<br/><br/>Friends is unbelievably pretentious.<br/><br/>Every so called actor in this is a complete tit.<br/><br/>All these hollow characters do is go to coffee shops, acquire the same seating every time, talk about utter drivel, there's the mind numbingly boring relationship crap, this mundane rubbish goes on and on.<br/><br/>No thanks. 5 minutes of an episode of Bottom is better than the whole Friends series, mainly because it has balls and originality.<br/><br/>Friends is nothing more than a plastic, sad excuse for entertainment for the robots and brainless dorks of society. I don't think I have ever been bored of this show no matter how many times a rewatch it. Just pick a random episode and you will be entertained. My sister and I learned English with "Friends" when we first moved from Cuba to USA. I was 11 and she was 8. To us it was more than a show, They were our real friends and they still are. Now my daughter and my nephew watch it with us. Still funny as ever. The whole drama brought me the touch and joy, those classic dramas still shocked me. Ten seasons down, we feel the joys and sorrows of the six-person line, but also witnessed their lush years to gradually mature process. To sum up their decade in one word, then I want to choose "growth.". My friends insisted to watch so i started in lockdown , and completed in 12 days , like I've never done this before , I'm a guy who barely watch something and completes , and i must say , the ending was so emotional that i cried Watch this before you die.
Life is around and with friends series is good.
U feel the show as it's u. This is literally the film affects my life more than rest of all films&dramas. I've grown with watching this. It made us to realise what's actually important to us. I wish, this never got an end... After all this years, still the best tv show ever. I'm 16 years old now..i'm not even american...
I just wanted to say...I love you guys...❤ This is probably one of, if the not the best sitcom about friendship ever made. With the lovable characters living their New York lives and having wonderfully crafted scripts and story lines, this is simply the best. The six friends are all recognisable now for doing ten years of Friends. These six are three girls: the charming Rachel Green (Emmy winning and four-time nominated, and Golden Globe winning and nominated Jennifer Aniston), the sensible Monica Gellar Bing (Courteney Cox Arquette) and simple Phoebe Buffay (Emmy winning and five-time nominated, and Golden Globe nominated Lisa Kudrow); and three boys: the smooth Joey Tribbiani (three-time Emmy and twice Golden Globe nominated Matt LeBlanc), the simple Chandler Bing (Emmy nominated Matthew Perry) and the nervous talking Ross Gellar (Emmy nominated David Schwimmer). Throughout the ten years that they did they had love stories, children stories, specials and the relationships between the friends. They have also had some good celebrity guests including: Jon Lovitz, Helen Hunt, George Clooney, Dan Castellaneta, Julia Roberts, Brooke Shields, David Arquette, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Jennifer Saunders, Emmy nominated Tom Selleck, Emmy nominated Christina Pickles, Emmy winning Bruce Willis, Emmy nominated Susan Sarandon, Denise Richards, Winona Ryder, Emmy nominated Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, Emmy nominated Brad Pitt, Alec Baldwin, Emmy nominated Hank Azaria, Emmy winning and nominated Christina Applegate, Scary Movie's Anna Faris, Emmy nominated Danny DeVito and many others. After ten years they finally did a brilliantly funny and an emotional final hour-long episode. The spin-off for Joey is nowhere as good as his original show. It won the BAFTA for Foreign TV Program Award, it was nominated The British Comedy Award for Best International TV Comedy, it won 6 Emmys (from 65 nominations), it was nominated for 5 Golden Globes for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy, and it was nominated 3 National Television Awards for Most Popular Comedy Programme. It was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and it was on The 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes for 2002 (when Brad Pitt was in it) and it even got to number 1 in 2004 when it ended. Outstanding! When a program has canned laughter every 4 to 5 seconds on nearly every word uttered...its pretty much an indictment of how Unfunny it is.<br/><br/>Example Ross: "Hey Joey" Audience:HAHAHAAAHHAHA.<br/><br/>That's pretty much Friends. Mindless drivel. 'Friends' is one of my favorite TV series, and sure is in the top 3 of them. When the series started, in 1994, I didn't care so much about it, and even couldn't understand how everybody could enjoy Friends so much. When my father started to buy the DVDS,(last year) I could follow the episodes from the very beginning,and then realize why it makes so much success. Friends is comic, without forgetting of being also romantic,dramatic and ironic. It's great to watch when we are in a bad mood, because the laughs are guaranteed. :) I love all the characters, but I need to say that I Monica and Chandler are the best! Chandler is without doubt, the funniest of them all. Monica with her paranoid personality, besides the fact she doesn't accept to not be the best, always make me laugh. For everybody who wants a nice day, watch Friends.:) Friends always had a special place in my heart from when I was 10 and up to now. Frankly, I'm not exactly an old one now, but I would say I grew up with it, since my parents used to watch it a lot. My mom had all 10 seasons on VHS, and later on DVD, and it's great. I loved it growing up, but watching it now took away some of of the charm.<br/><br/>Now don't hate me already, it's a great show, I still believe so, but it has its flaws. For the most part, its issues lie in the continuity of the show. I get that it's a satirical sitcom, but that doesn't mean it can't try to keep a flowing story, which it feels like it is actually trying to do. But it keeps bringing in plot lines that end up forgotten a few episodes later. For one, there's Ben, Ross' kid. He was somewhat forgotten. The wedding episode of Chandler and Monica is a good example of this. Ben is at the wedding, and obviously he came with Ross since Carol and Susan aren't there, but Ross acts like he's not even there. It's his son, and obviously his own son would also talk to him. But he doesn't, neither does Ross talk to him. For god's sake, he doesn't even acknowledge his existence.<br/><br/>Phoebe's dad is another example, also her biological mother. Her dad is in the show for one episode, the episode where her grandmother dies, but he's not in it post that, even though it feels like some kind of character development could happen between the two of them, a relationship maybe, like what we have with Monica and Ross' parents or Rachel's parents. The same for her biological mother. She's there the episode they meet, the episode after and then when she needs advice on whether or not she should be a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife. But after that whole ordeal, she's gone for the rest of the show. She's not even at her wedding with Mike.<br/><br/>These continuity errors are my only real problem with the show, the whole point of the show, the humor and the friends, is amazing, it's great. And that's why I give it a 7/10, because it's good, but has flaws. After force-feeding myself a half-dozen episodes of "Friends," I was reminded of H.L. Mencken's observation that "No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public."<br/><br/>This is one of the most contrived shows ever produced. I have to assume that the people who find this series so riveting only do so to live vicariously through the lives of the characters. Either that or they are immature yuppie wannabees whose sensibilities have been compromised by gamma rays. The effusiveness of most of the positive reviews made me want to throw up.<br/><br/>Friends" reeks of nauseating sexual innuendos that are spat out like projectiles from a tennis ball machine.<br/><br/>When it comes to dealing with sex, "Cheers", Frasier" and "Seinfeld" were far more clever, witty and intelligent. "Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David wanted his show's humor to be based largely on real experiences. The show broke one barrier after another and either originated or popularized numerous expressions. "Seinfeld's" sexual humor was clever and original; on "Friends" it was on the same level as smut.<br/><br/>On "Cheers," Ted Danson as babe hound Sam Malone was far more endearing than any of the male characters on "Friends." The show never ran out of hilarious one-liners, which was quite a feat considering that the show didn't often venture outside the confines of a bar.<br/><br/>"Frasier" was both cerebral and jocular (how many TV shows make references to the Algonquin Round Table?) Kelsey Grammar's Frasier Crane was sidesplitting as he pursued one failed relationship after another, but he never descended to the low-level sexual innuendos that were characteristic of "Friends." <br/><br/>Unlike evergreens such as the "Dick Van Dyke Show," 20 years from now "Friends" will have been consigned to the dustbin of forgotten TV shows alongside "Meet Millie" and "Hey, Jeannie." We'll see. I have given this show plenty of chances but I always find myself wanting to commit suicide by the end. This show is just not funny. The characters are just so annoying and say and do just stupid things. Not stupid funny but just so dumb. People always compare this to Seinfeld. There is not comparison. Seinfeld will always be one of the most creative and funny shows out there. And not to mention the intro, so so corny. I just don't get the hype.I really gave it my all to watch but it just doesn't make any sense how it's so popular. Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer are also two of the most annoying people. There voices, faces and antics. Friends is probably one of the best sitcoms ever shown on TV. The humor is absolutely amazing. You can view this sitcom over and over again. The emotions that the actors put in it is unbelievable. It really makes you believe its real, and thats something i don't often see in sitcoms. the themes the show present are all realistic themes you can have in real life, and thats also one of the reasons what makes this series so great.It really was hard to not to cry at the end of the last episode when they all go to central perk for the last time, knowing it was the end of a great sitcom. I'm really gonna miss this show, just because its one of the best ever. Luckilly i have all the 10 friends boxes, so I can amuse me with all the jokes that chandler makes, the stupidity of Joey, and so on. "Friends " ,a idiotic show about a group of(unfunny ) morons that talk a lot of stupid (and unfunny ) things that nobody will say in real life.<br/><br/>Basically it tries to be a adorable romantic comedy ,but the whole result is just annoying ,inane and unrealistic . This show isn't charming at all is just stupid . I can't believe that some people compare "Seinfeld " with this monstrosity . Just to comment ,here are some differences :<br/><br/>1- Seinfeld is funny , Friends is not funny at all . <br/><br/>2 -Seinfeld is clever , Friends is only stupid . <br/><br/>3- Seinfeld characters are likable ,Friend characters are annoying (and unfunny )<br/><br/>Please ,don't think that my hate is to the members of the cast (unless they collaborated to made the horrible script ) ,is just that I can't believe that a show so bad as this could last so long ( I just see some episodes of the first and the second season and I hated it ) Did I mention that it was unfunny ? This show was the most overrated thing on television. I started watching this programme at the start of 2004 when it was basically finished. I thought the show would be alright. I was so wrong. It was GREAT! FANTASTIC! HILARIOUS! you name it! I have watched every episode from the re-runs and i laugh my head off when i watch it. Let me explain it to you....<br/><br/>Its about six friends - Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston), Monica Gellar(Courteney Cox), Phoebe Bouffant(Lisa Kudrow), Joey Tribbiani(Matt Le Blanc), Chandler Bing(Matthew Perry) and Ross Gellar(David Schwimmer)who all live in New York together. It's about how they go through everything together and it shows you that even though you have fights with your friends, they are a very big part of your life and appreciate them.<br/><br/>The show is hilarious....Joey is beyond thick but such an adorable character. Chandler is always making fun of people and can be really sweet. Monica is unbelievably controlling and shrill but a caring and down-to-earth person. Rachel tends to overreact but so lovable. Phoebe is a weird character but you can tell she has a big heart. Thats the thing about all the characters...they have such a big heart.<br/><br/>This is by far the funniest comedy I have ever watched and i definitely recommend it but not for children below 8 or so. Please watch it...if you do...you will know what i mean when i say " FRIENDS IS BRILLIANT,WATCH IT !!!!" This is my first review and I decided to write a review because this is the best TV show I ever saw. I have watched more than 100 TV series for sure and most of them are Sci-Fi and Action TV series. <br/><br/>I started watching this TV series at the beginning of 2017 only because ratings and reviews are good. But, after I watched few episodes, I couldn't stop watching this show. This is not one of great TV series, This is the best TV series I have ever watched and I love this show. I don't know why I love this TV show so much, maybe it's because all actors are great, or story is great or all jokes are getting better or maybe something else. <br/><br/>ANYWAY, what I can tell you is, this will be the show that makes you laugh every single second. So, I will recommend this show to anyone and everyone. <br/><br/>... and one thing.... Did I mention that this is the best show I have ever seen...? This show is just getting so irritating and predictable, all the "jokes" are based on only few facts such as:<br/><br/>1) Joey's unrealistic stupidity (the weird part is that he wasn't that stupid in the first few seasons and then out of the blue he becomes dumber than a dodo)<br/><br/>2) Monica's cleanliness habits<br/><br/>3) Chandler's sarcasm <br/><br/>Rarely any other jokes are based on something else. This show also contains a lot of drama and unneeded angst (created by the dreaded and irritating duo of Ross and Rachel) . <br/><br/>In conclusion:<br/><br/>The show is cheesy, cliché and predictable accompanied by witless humor. But on the good side, if you have not watched any episodes of this show, the first few seasons would be enjoyable. Also it a good pass time show.<br/><br/>I give it 5/10 To me Friends is the most overrated show. The humor is weak and unintelligent, and the characters try too hard to be funny and act like everything is la-la land. Other than these major flaws, the show is just missing something else that many other comedy's have, and I think it's the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor. Other shows like Weeds and The United States of Tara are comical, but also have a strong plot and theme. I think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable, but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and society's problems. Even shows like Arrested Development and Grounded For Life apply more to the "good comedy but strong plot and theme."<br/><br/>And if the writer or director's goal was not to have a dramatic plot, then they should have some warm meaning to the show. For example, Full House, The Nanny, and Golden Girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages. The importance of family support in Full House, how true friends will always help you in Golden Girls, and how a full-time care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as The Nanny. I think Friends tries too much to be like a Seinfeld for teens and young adults. However, Seinfeld has much better writing and humor. <br/><br/>Every time I watched this show it always ended up boring me. I really don't understand why people like this show so much where there is so much better comedy television out there. "I invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the air...and keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure uou that you will observe a great wasteland."<br/><br/>-- Newton N Minow, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, speech before the National Association of Broadcasters, Washington, DC, May 9, 1961<br/><br/>We were warned.<br/><br/>"Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on televsion and I've been sitting in front of the tube observing the "great wasteland" since 1954.<br/><br/>Obviously there are those who love the show because it was a hit for a decade. It's happened before. There are wildly successful and formulaic TV series that just don't seemed to die despite their lack of merit. ("Murder, She Wrote", "Charlie's Angels", "Providence")<br/><br/>"Friends" simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of "Frasier". The characters in "Friends" seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.<br/><br/>The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of "Friends".)<br/><br/>This shallow, unfunny, tedious, predictable moneymaker seems to be designed for a certain demographic slice which might be those folks born around 1975. (If this seems to be a backhanded whack at the "X" Generation that finds itself equally mesmerized by computer games, I'm sorry. However, if the shoe fits...)<br/><br/>The entertainment industry is smart and delicately fine-tuned to the acquisition of a dollar which is why producers live and die by weekly ratings. They will craftily provide specific segments of the public precisely what they want. The industry understood that this banal gruel would fare well and it has. The only defense for this series, I believe, is that it's CALCULATED to be bad by providing a mirror to people who are as lacking in depth and humor as the characters in "Friends". Water, like people, seeks its own level.<br/><br/>Thank goodness even the actors are now tired of performing in this repulsive show.<br/><br/>If upon the demise of the series the time slot were filled with a cooking show, it would nonetheless be a great improvement. To this day, the worldwide success of Friends is still a bit of a mystery to me.<br/><br/>Sure, the show has its moments, but nothing that groundbreaking or laughing-out-loud funny that would have justified all the accolades.<br/><br/>Friends was a very ambivalent show: it had the pretense of being believable, while still relying, and heavily so, on the same old Sticom 101 material.<br/><br/>The characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new, but in the end they all fell into a stereotype, as the show was devolving into a comedy-soap. Whatever development the characters had, it was either short-lived, flimsy or a "Flanderization" (ie. comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasn't so dominant earlier on).<br/><br/>The core of the show, the infamous Ross+Rachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous "we were on a break!" debacle. Both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat, which seriously harmed the empathy. Long, drawn-out relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down. Both Ross and Rachel instead acted like 8th graders all along, being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>It almost felt like them getting back together was the writers' Haily Mary pass... "We're out of ideas... Let's get Ross and Rachel share a kiss, or have a baby!"<br/><br/>The "happy ending" feels more like a token send-off to tie some loose ends, but it's really just another knee-jerk reaction of two adults who clearly can't put their act together.<br/><br/>The same lack of development hits Joey as well. Despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot, if you're willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating, he goes from being a suave ladies' man to a childlike moron who's more or less his married friends baby. His aborted love story with Rachel could have been a much better finale, given he was indeed showing a softer side. But, alas, it had to be Ross+Rachel.<br/><br/>Monica and Chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred, so them finding each other made sense and, with all the exaggerated personality quirks (Monica is a control freak, Chandler is socially inept) they're the most believable characters in the end.<br/><br/>Phoebe can be fun on small doses, but she's clearly having mental issues, so shoehorning her into married life, albeit while still retaining her out-there personality, felt forced.<br/><br/>That's the most annoying side of the show: for all the hype and all the great reviews, Friends was just another sit-com, with plenty of forced drama. The innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature, but I maintain it wasn't that great.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least the show has aged horribly, so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller. Nostalgia will still keep it going strong, but to those who loved it so much back then I ask... watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise. I don't care what ANYONE says, FRIENDS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST SITCOM THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN!!!! I mean...come on! A wise-cracking sarcastic "Transpon-transponster" turned advertising agent...a neurotic, completely over-the-top chef...a formerly spoilt now down-to-earth hilarious fashion expert...a daft but funny largely unsuccessful actor...a crazy, weird, kooky massage therapist...a paleontologist so geeky that he's gone full circle into sweet and adorable...WHAT MORE CAN U WANT???? Over TEN - yes, say it with me, TEN YEARS - the writers and the actors of this show have WOWED us all with their sharp one-liners, their gestures and facial expressions that only they can pull off, simply their amazing talent. I don't know where they got these guys from, but this is the best ensemble I have ever seen. You know usually when you watch a show, it's like there's always at least one character you can't stand and you wonder why they're even there? With Friends, you can't help but love every single character!! You can't take any of these actors/characters out...the piece would be incomplete! And what about their voices and facial expressions? I mean...WHO COMES UP WITH THIS STUFF???? You can't watch Friends without laughing out loud - often for hours on end! There are so many sitcoms I watch that I'm lucky if I barely crack a smile. But Friends is a guaranteed laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!! The lines they deliver - and WOW do they deliver! - are lines I will forever remember. And not just because I'm a complete Friends freak - I mean, I can identify guest stars and extras in the background, name particular episodes, recite all the lines - but because these people are just brilliant! Simply brilliant! I say "BRING BACK FRIENDS!" Or at least let us know what's going with the characters or something. Bring some back in 'Joey'...maybe that will help the show a bit...I LOVE FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's an abysmal show. I've never ever got the popularity of this, especially outside of America.<br/><br/>In each of the last 3 houses I've lived in over the last 10 years at least one person in each house has been an avid 'Friends' fan, so I am fully exposed to it, and have seen many episodes. It's also on tele every day.<br/><br/>Where do I start? The title is as good a place as any. I can imagine the producers discussing that: "Right, we've got a comedy about a group of friends, we need a name? How about Friends" If that's the imagination it doesn't leave much hope for the story lines.<br/><br/>I know it's a lighthearted sit com but come on? How old are they supposed to be? They were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series 1, here we are ten years later & nothings changed. They're all approaching the big 40! yet they're still living the lives of 18 year olds.<br/><br/>And how the hell do they afford those penthouses? They change their jobs like I change my underpants, Monica worked in a kitchen, Joey can't get any acting work. The rent would be thousands.<br/><br/>Friends is nothing more than the equally benal & tedious 'Saved by the Bell' but for grown-ups. It's the old flogged-to-death "Three guys, three girls, all stunningly gorgeous, occasionally fancy or sleep with each other & with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group."<br/><br/>The only thing funny about about Friends is unintentionally funny. Those parties they occasionally have in their flat (penthouse). The so called guests they invite, who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in & pass themselves off as close companions of the characters, when it's clear to the entire watching world that they've met for the first time at the start of the shot.<br/><br/>It's a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem. It's the most unrealistic portrayal of New York in history. No black people, Chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter, even with minor parts. It's New York! One of the most multi cultural cities on the planet.<br/><br/>Admittedly there is one funny aspect I have omitted. Chandler. The guy is enormously talented, makes the entire show, and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is.<br/><br/>Rachel & Monica are likable characters & not annoying, but nor are they funny. But the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man. Come on? Please. Don't treat the viewer as a two year old.<br/><br/>Joey is likable but is given no script to work with. Too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing. Wrong. Trigger is Only Fools & Horses was thick but funny with it, because of the timing. He's comments were made at exactly the right time. Joey's are not, & unfortunately for a good actor & potentially very good character, he comes over more as irritating than anything else.<br/><br/>But the real problem with Friends are in Ross & Phoebe. The only applicable description of Ross is that he needs a good kick up the back-side, to put some oomf (?) into the bloke. He's a drip. He just drones on & on in that slow dull manner, series after series. In any real life situation a Ross & a Rachel would just not be a couple. A Rachel & a Brad Pitt would be a couple, somewhat appropriately.<br/><br/>But even he can't beat Phoebe for irritation. It's not the actress at all that's the problem, it's 100% the character. I just don't get her. The Floor Manager must hold up the "Laugh Now" board for the audience after every line she says. For the life of me, I just don't know what she says that is funny.<br/><br/>And in the equally irritating coffee lounge. (Why are the sofas always empty? Never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move), those scenes where she plays her guitar. I've been to funerals funnier than them. All she does is sing in coherent songs that don't rhyme, or make any sense whatsoever. Anyone could write a sketch like that.<br/><br/>I also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door. No-one I know would put up with that, even from their Grandparents. Nor people who say "Hey" instead of Hello, but thats getting as tedious as the show now. Perhaps if you find shows like "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Two and a half men" amusing you may want to add this dribble to your watch-list. <br/><br/>on the other hand <br/><br/>If "Arrested Development" and "Seinfeld" "30 Rock" and similar shows tickle your funny bone stay far away from friends. It is truly a thoughtless bore.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was subjected to his show through a particularly hot girlfriend and I can honestly say that in the 100+ episodes I waded through I only laughed once. I can't remember the instance but it was something physical that Joey did. The girlfriend, although smitten with the show rarely laughed more than once an episode. I gather it was more of a fairy tale that she could escape into than the comedy that drew her in. <br/><br/>Popular rarely means good. See McDonalds. Friends is about 6 Friends who live in New York and have to solve all of life's problems to sex, to relationships, to... well... basically thats what its all about.<br/><br/>The idea contains the same old friendships, relationship, babies, love, marriage, job, and materialism. Nothing to contribute to society... never once I see the characters face real problems of debt, psychological torture, or identity crisis (Like Chandler experiencing what being Gay feels like for a day, or Rachel hanging with the poor. Or even Phoebe living in an asylum?) And about the racial cultures... Usually I never see them date anyone else other than a few colors to "liven" the space. Oh, the token black person that comes out one or two episodes is not helping either. Seeing as New York is full of culture, they made it look like the other races are not important.<br/><br/>Their lifestyle is perfect. They crapped money out of their really low-paying jobs and spend most of their time well, sipping their coffee, stalking about that hot guy or girl and plans to bang them later to the episode, ending with a break-up for the dumbest of reasons.<br/><br/>Aside from Chandler, their jobs are almost impossible to ask why their apartments costs more than what they earn. Well, Monica has "rent control" but hey... no one tried to kick her out yet... Ross is still controlling his money after all the divorces he has been in. Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe gave a speech on not taking charity, but hey, they suck the living breeches of the first three and claiming paying them back was almost impossible.<br/><br/>Okay, off with the plots, let's go to the characters...<br/><br/>Character analysis: Chandler - He is apparently one of the more humorous characters. He is a sample of a realistic person who we can hang out in the office or sip some coffee or something. I don't have problems with him and Monica together, to the dismay of all the true-blue Frendsian fans.<br/><br/>Phoebe - I like her for being a bit different in the first few seasons... but then after a while, she started being horny, annoying, and kind of a hypocrite. Okay, so she has a hard life... but people like her in real life, struggle to be as normal as possible. She just left that philosophy behind because of it. It's not even trying until the tenth season or so...<br/><br/>Monica - She isn't a funny character, but she has been a person who actually is believable in ways that she is right, and she is apparently the mature one. Sadly, she is usually looked down upon because her other Friends think that her style is annoying. Sadly, her baby-freak, "I can be like anyone else" philosophy threw me off after like season one. I always wondered why she wasn't kicked out of the circle.<br/><br/>Rachel - I hate her. She hasn't changed ever since day one, to be honest. Her personality is this "Me-Me-Me!" spoiled brat who went to the city, and a few jobs and a million boyfriends later... it's still all about "Me!" The relationship with her and Ross was somewhat annoying for and a mood killer for almost forever, and almost in the last episode of the series, BANG! They're together again. Can Ross just leave or slap Rachel for all the horrible things she has done to him? Oh Noooo... because Ross is too in "loooove" with Rachel... Reasons were almost to no idea... Having sexual thoughts with Chandler and almost having a short, useless hit-off with Joey was also not helping.<br/><br/>Ross - I pitied his first season philosophy and hey, I liked him for being at least sympathetic there... just that he had two additional divorces that he became a screaming, yelling, irritating person who is smart and intelligent, yet acts dumb and immature for his age. The whole Rachel thing is lost of chemistry and yeah, they were on a break. Rachel is apparently responsible for all of the things that happened to them and then claiming after the whole fiasco that the writers make it say that it's Ross' fault anyway for Rachel's doing. Ross would be better off on a suicide for being with a devil woman.<br/><br/>Joey - Dumb Actor who doesn't do anything to contribute to society. Oh yeah, his spin off may be the worst thing anyone has ever made... Even if I can feel things from the characters. He is a handsome guy, that's a contribution right? And Him having sex with 500 girls is considered a real good thing. In general, actors have to research their roles, and Joey... he just swoops in Shakespeare because hey... He's an actor! <br/><br/>To conclude, I have been annoyed by the show... and I get why people love it so much. It's the art of Escapism of them in a Fantasy world that makes everyone love them so. But sadly, I have watched shows that actually make use of real life as a humor tool that makes Friends forgettable for me. For ten years, nothing truly EVER happened.. and parodies like "Furends" are apparently more of a short version of the whole rant.<br/><br/>A 1 out of ten... Just because I can't give negative number rankings. :( I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.<br/><br/>If you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn't) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I'll summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, "Two And A Half Men" and "The King Of Queens" as the television executives. Now then, on with the review.<br/><br/>These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.<br/><br/>The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be "comedy" requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development).<br/><br/>This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I've provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br/><br/>I have watched very little of "Friends" in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned. I can't believe that it isn't commonly recognized that this show is a 100% rip-off of 'Living Single'...which also followed the lives and loves of six urban twenty-somethings. Oh, they were black, so it must not count! Friends is a terribly written show, yet somehow managed to be funny on occasion w/ very likable characters. A tribute to the acting abilities of the cast...because the writers were terrible and got worse every year.<br/><br/>I wouldn't waste much time w/ "Friends", the predictable gags just aren't worth it. Cheers, Seinfeld and "It's Like, You Know" are far funnier. Heck, "Love American Style" was funnier. Throughout this show's tenure and being in the age category that this show was supposed to appeal to, I could never understand why it was so popular. Re-watching one or two episodes in syndication years later, my opinion hasn't changed<br/><br/>Unfunny and forced humor, weak dialogue,awful acting, annoying characters, inane story lines -this show literally had it all. How did this unfunny drivel find an audience? This is probably the worst attempt at comedy I have ever seen and that's saying something Also the suspension of disbelief needed for the premise of this show to work is amazing. These people have jobs that would pay an average salary at best, yet they can afford to live in a plush Manhattan apartment. Give me a break. And notice the lack of African-Americans and other minorities on this show? In a multicultural melting point like New York? You'd think they were living in the segregated South during the 1940s rather than a modern, vibrant, culturally diverse city (To be fair, I'll give David Schwimmer credit where it's due because he seems to have been the sole cast/crew member who actually realized the stupidity of all this and to that extent he actually lobbied for the inclusion of an African-American character, leading to the casting of Aisha Tyler for at least a few episodes. But it's sad to think that he's the only one out of the whole cast and crew who didn't just blindly accept the absurd premise on which this show was based during its whole decade of existence) Ugh...to think this was on for almost a decade. Defies belief We were force fed 238 episodes. Like Foie Gras Ducks, people scurried up to their TV sets for years to get tube-fed this insipid mush. I appealed to their better nature but was shouted down & will probably get many 'unhelpful comment' clicks here on IMDb.<br/><br/>Please try to clear your minds of all the hype & the awards this won & watch an episode from a fresh point of view. It's not funny apart from 1 maybe 2 laughs per episode, provided by Matt Perry. It has dated very badly too. All this mid 90s PC nannying makes me sick. Anyone who happens to drink alcohol is portrayed as an alcoholic. Anyone who smokes has to quit etc. "I'll be there for you", let's all be supportive, let's talk over our insignificant, Middle Class issues in a Coffee Shop. NO! Go down the pub & have a laugh. If I want a comforting, self-help video I'll go & buy one.<br/><br/>Wake up everybody. 'Friends' isn't funny, never was. It's like a cheap, fatty Burger. It seems good but deep down you know it's got no substance & is actually killing you from the inside. How do I hate "Friends"? Let me count the ways:<br/><br/>Firstly, it rated an "F" with the test audience (don't believe me, check The Smoking Gun).<br/><br/>Secondly, it ran 10 years without being remotely funny ONCE (beating the record held by the completely laugh-free 8 year run of Full House, which, like this crap, was produced by a division of the Time Warner media empire, had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major American city, bland-looking guy of Mediterranean descent trying to get into show business, and a dumb guy named Joey).<br/><br/>Third, that horrible theme makes NSync sound like The Beatles.<br/><br/>Fourth, the cast couldn't act its way out of a paper bag (I thank one of the other posters for pointing out that Jennifer "I'm not a star, I just sleep with them" Aniston is Telly Savalas's goddaughter. Her father is also on Days of Our Lives. Can you say nepotism, boys and girls?).<br/><br/>Fifth, the writers would eat up clichés like that last one I wrote as if they were brand new. And not only did they steal from the superior-by-default Seinfeld, they stole from Mr. Bean and even Punky Brewster! When Soleil Moon Frye, who really must have needed the money by that point, punched Chandler in the face, even that felt like a retread of a Punky episode where she punched Chad Allen in the face! <br/><br/>Sixth, how can they afford an apartment like that in New York? They hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at Southfork. On other, superior, actually FUNNY roommate shows like The Odd Couple, Three's Company, Kate & Allie, and the grand dame of them all, The Golden Girls, they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent. I've seen fewer logical leaps on Gilligan's Island.<br/><br/>What's worse is all the Emmies it got. Truly great shows like Bob Newhart's two classic sitcoms never won a single thing, yet this wins "Best" Comedy series. This show and Seinfeld (not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well) are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead (the last time sitcoms were declared "dead" in the early 1980s was a golden age in comparison to today). As long as there continue to be reruns and DVD releases of classic, pre-1990s sitcoms such as I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Soap, Cheers, Family Ties, Newhart, The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls, Married With Children, Roseanne, pre-2000 Simpsons, and countless others like it then I say let it die.<br/><br/>This is truly the most vile, trite, unfunny, obnoxious television series of all time. I jumped for joy the day it was canceled, and I hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is, because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks. This is the worst show. Buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has better humor and more adult than friends "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on television and I've been sitting in front of the tube observing Friends" simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of "Frasier". The characters in "Friends" seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.<br/><br/>The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of "Friends".) Having caught the odd episode, I've always considered this unwatchable drivel and avoided it. However a friend who's opinion I trust recently told me that the early seasons were much better, and since series 1 was available free on demand I decided to give it a go. I managed episode one and will never watch this again.<br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing funny or even vaguely amusing, and the laughter track just added to my irritation. The characters are stupid, petty and vindictive. In one scene one of the women destroys a watch belonging to a man who persuaded her to sleep with him by telling her he hadn't been able to make love since his last relationship ended some years before. I fail to see the humour.<br/><br/>So many people seem to love this, I just wish I could understand why.<br/><br/>1/10 To these days I can't figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people. The best conclusion I could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that American people where suffering in those days.<br/><br/>Perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as: divorce, infidelity, sexual inclinations, obsession etc, with a smile on their faces, real people in a way, could deal with that issues in that way. However, "Friends" was a fictional show, much of what it happened, albeit taken from reality, was dealt in a light-hearted way.<br/><br/>To sum up, although the premise was interesting (six friends living together in New York), the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic. Just remove laugh tune from background and you will able to see trash show if you are living on another planet where you stuck and having only having this series in your smartphone then one thing just burn your phone bcoz after watching this show you will try to suicide. Seriously nothing in this series is worth watching.. If u haven't seen friends where have u been, truly the greatest TV show ever made A lot of people say it's overrated, but I think it's so popular simply because it's an amazing show. I've most likely seen every episode 10+ times, and I'm still watching. I hope it's popularity is carried on to the next generation. If you can watch a series 15 years later and still find it relevant and enjoyed it, this is a sign of a great series Can't stop watching over and over again! It's funny, it's familiar! Season 4:
i kinda got out of friends for a bit but the last couple of episodes were fun and interesting especially with ross saying rachaels name at the end. Nice and funny, I watch it for second time on Netflix Thanks for the accompany at every hard time. I watched it for several times and love it. It's really hard for me to watch a movie or a show for more than once but trust me if you're of my type, this show is an exception
It's an extraordinary and exceptional show! I'll love these guys as forever!! No really, I don't get it. Why people love 'Friends'? It's one of the most childish show I 've ever had the mischance to watch it (I lied here, I watch it because I wanted to - I want to see what others found funny). First of all, the annoying laughter in the background every time an actor says a line is just stupid and annoying(in every line?) and spoils everything, even if it were an actual clever line. That means they point out the 'funny part' so the viewer knows where is the joke and laugh like a programmed robot. It is moronic to laugh when someone hint the funny part, think about it. <br/><br/>Secondly, every character behave like a little child. I can't see any adult behavior here. Have you ever see a woman with a decent amount of IQ in her head, to try catch the flu because they told her that she sing better with a gruff voice? And not just that, the director loved that part and decided to repeat it scene after scene! Stupid exaggerated pointless jokes every two seconds by people who can't really act and make childish comments and grimaces all the time. Maybe people like it because its cool to memorize the 'funny' (I wince every time I write that word here) phrases. But if they repeat it few times in their head and actual think what they are saying, they could easily understand that's just plain moronic. But the laughter in the background make them laugh like idiots because they told to do so. I will never understand it. And i don't want to. I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.<br/><br/>What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. <br/><br/>When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever. Rudjdjdjdjdjd

Amazing It's a comic series about six friends who live in New York,four of them live in the same building. They custom get together in a coffee shop called "Central Perk" and this coffee shop it's near Central Park and funny things happen in this environment. Characters features: Monica: organized and she is a cooking chef. Ross:Monica's brother, immature, nerd and he's a paleontologist. Joey:stallion (the guy), he think's he is an actor and he is jerk. Chandler: he is a funny gay and nobody knows his profession. Rachael: she is a spoiled woman and so beautiful. Phoebe: she's a bad singer, she protect the animals by the way she is crazy.<br/><br/>Opinion: In spite of being a very old series make success in now a days and we like because it's a simple series with a commons situations and that's why the series it's so funny and make success Well, where do I start. <br/><br/>This television series (won't call it comedy) is the sorriest pile of rubbish I have ever seen. The funniest thing about this series is that it somehow is called a comedy. I can never see anything funny about it at all. The jokes are like those cheap ones you get out of Christmas crackers.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's the American humour but I know there are other American comedies out there that are a lot better than Friends.<br/><br/>They've taken a perfectly good song and ruined that too. When it plays up on the radio I feel physically sick.<br/><br/>The acting is soooo cheap and tacky. The attempted jokes are basic and flat. I think the writers need a good lesson in comedy. Here's a good list:- Only Fools & Horses, Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances, The Office, Alan Partirdge and the list goes on. <br/><br/>I think Friends is as enjoyable as having acid thrown into your face or maybe being strapped to a firework and sent miles up into the sky. This show has its moments when it would genuinely be funny; however 99% of the time I just wanted to hack my own arm off just so I can chuck it at them. The jokes are predictable and watching Chandler be sarcastic every 2 seconds gets boring after the 100th time. The situations they get themselves in is completely unrealistic, which is fine so long as the situation is funny; however the situations they get themselves into just makes them all look like a bunch of idiots in a nut house.<br/><br/>The characters are even worse than the poor script they work from. It is very clear that David Schwimmer is the only one who has any talent, as the rest of the characters can't act and just look a bit weird, not their appearance, as it's clear that the only reason why the women got the parts is because of their appearance.<br/><br/>Also that audience drives me insane, as every time something significant happens they all scream endlessly. FOR GOD'S SAKE, IT'S ONLY A TV SHOW. okay i do not know were to start on this ever so dreadfully painful experience that is called friends. this is one reason we need ugly people on TV cause all you horny freaks cant get enough of Jenifer. the humor is so bad you cant help but change the station and that god awful theme song at the beginning for me thats were the show ends. all the characters do is sit around on a couch or diner and yap saying things that are not funny nor entertaining at all why is this show loved so goddamn much i don't know watch a good humorous show like Dave chapel he will make you laugh not this garbage want a real sitcom there family guy and family ties not this trash! friends is the best program ever, i have every episode on DVD, and watch them constantly, you would think i would get tired of them because i know all the lines, but i don't think anyone could get tired of Ross and Rachel's "moments", Monica's hyperactive cleaning, Phoebe's inappropriate songs, Joey's cute stupidity and constantly looking for dates, or chandlers sarcasm and jokes. all the actors are amazing, Jenifer, Courtney, Lisa, and David play Rachel Greene, Monica geller, Phoebe buffay and Ross geller so well - but i have to say Matt and Matthew are the best! Matt for making joey so lovable, and for being brave and taking the risk of the joey show-which i think is the second best show ever! after friends of course-i think its gonna be really successful-I'm so glad he's keeping the legacy alive - and Matthew, what can you say about Matthew perry accept that he literally is the funniest man ever and such a talented actor, he plays chandler so great-and oz in the whole nine/ten yards,and Oscar novak in three to tango, he is so great, its my absolute dream to meet him, hes the best guy in the world! A brilliant series that combines laughter and drama. Its a story about Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston), Monica Gellar(Courteney Cox), Phoebe Bouffant(Lisa Kudrow), Joey Tribbiani(Matt Le Blanc), Chandler Bing(Matthew Perry) and Ross Gellar(David Schwimmer).<br/><br/> Friends is superbly funny. It also has plenty of guest stars every episode to keep you involved. They include Robin Williams, Helen Hunt, Giovanni Ribisi, Teri Garr, Tom Selleck,Hank Azaria, Charlton Heston and Isabelli Rosellini, to name a few.<br/><br/> Watch friends because you will be automatically entranced by its quick wit and clever scripting that appeals to all of the family. Rating=4/5 Friends is a hilarious sitcom! It's characters are very likable and wonderfully played, the situations it puts it's characters in are hilarious! Over the 10 years, we have grown to sympathize and care for each of these friends so much that we see them as our own friends. Unlike most shows, never once did this show falter in quality, and it got progressively funnier and better as it went along. I am glad that the friends all got nominated or won an Emmy at least once for their portrayals, but the only one who never did was Courtney Cox. I don't know why, since I have to say she was one of the strongest actors and her Monica was hilarious! All in all, this show will definitely continue to live on in the hearts of viewers. Friends seems to be one of those movies and shows that just divide people in two. Those who love it, and those who hate it. I for one love it. I have no problem with people who do not like the show, as there are many popular things I do not like, opinions are a funny thing - however I do not like people screaming that Friends "is stupid and for stupid people" and other outright idiotic statements such as that. Compared to many many blockbuster comedies or other sitcoms, also listed by those who dislike friends, the humor in friends can be even somewhat brilliant and while certainly there are bad/idiotic jokes in the show, tell me one show or comedy that doesn't have them.<br/><br/>In addition, I just have to mention that in my opinion Matthew Perry is far above all other actors in this series, his way of acting and his great ability to be sarcastic in an extremely funny way make him a character who rarely leaves me without good laughs.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars on my sitcom scale :) this show is definitely moving back up on my list. it started going slow for a while, but this whole baby drama (and joey and rachel) is making me step back and look at the show again in a different light.<br/><br/>the show has come back to its comedic roots, where the little things are what drive the show... who can resist chandler and monica battling it out for the tub?<br/><br/>yes, friends has come back home again... you've been missed. I love this show! I have every single episode and watch as often is I can (much to the annoyance of my family). Now, I know loads of people think that Friends is the biggest pile of garbage on TV.<br/><br/>These people say that acting is horrendous, which it's not. Maybe the story lines aren't very realistic, but the characters are not so overdone in the situations nor do the act as though nothing big is happening is rather large situations. They act (more or less) like regular people would.<br/><br/>And then they target the jokes, when there's nothing to target. I'll give in to the fact that it's not polished, sophisticated humor and it's just slapstick comedy about sex, you know, jokes that you don't have to work to get. But all comedy's don't have to be like that to be good. I mean, face it people, if every single comedy out there was a 'The Office' we're not going to have all that much fun. Sometimes you just need to turn your brain off and enjoy some television.<br/><br/>In any case, I don't care if no-one agrees with me because I think this show ROCKS! I feel like the only person ever who just doesn't like Friends, but I honestly think it's the most overrated show ever. It's not that funny. At all. Yeah an occasional smile, but nothing hilariously funny, and none of the stories are funny either. 99% of the main story lines are about who's dating who, which is more like a soap opera than a sitcom. And the small, single episode story lines are just not funny. Think of Seinfeld's genius single-episode story lines compared to Friends, and it's like comparing wine and tap water. It's just not funny. The male actors aren't all that great actors, and this is evident by their lack of success after Friends. Cheesy and not funny with lame repetitive story lines about who's dating who. The only redeeming quality is that it is still exponentially better than the sitcoms that followed and the ones that are currently on today. None of them are funny, including some other modern "classics" like Full House and That 70s Show are intensely overrated and just not funny. Seinfeld and Cheers reign supreme, while current sitcoms continue to flop, with the exception of a few like The Middle (hilarious and perfect, but lost steam in the past couple seasons), Arrested Development, and maybe Modern Family... Maybe Big Bang's early seasons. I just don't understand why everybody makes such a fuss over this sit com. Sure it's funny sometimes, but it's all bad! We can start with the cast and the acting: IT'S LAME! Did those boys and girls ever take acting lessons? If so, they must have had some pretty lousy teachers, because non of them can act. It's just constant waving and hysterical screaming and yelling. The producers should have hired clowns instead. And the actors got payed for that? And so many awards! Such a waste of time and money...<br/><br/>And the plot. Does it say something? Well, yes, one thing - friends are very important and it's good to have them. And I totally agree. Sure, the atmosphere is warm and friendly, but there is nothing else they can tell. It's just sex, dating and stupid skeleton's coming out of Monica's stuffed closet.<br/><br/>Just lame. six friends who struggling in new York,find comfort,support and love among each other. yeah, that is it.there is nothing more to the story. The fact that the story is so simple,yet the sitcom was groundbreaking is what makes friends one of the best sitcoms of all time. the dialogue,the characters,the chemistry between the cast is what makes this one of the best TV shows. this isn't a show you watch.we literally live with the six friends laughing at their situations and crying at their emotions. the dialogues are the real heroes, as each and every dialogue will have you laughing and gasping for breadth. the chemistry between the cast is electrifying. the characters start of one dimensional and slowly and beautifully develop. the performances are really good.Particularly the performance of Lisa kudrow and Matthew Perry are impressive. overall i would give it a 10. When i discovered "Friends" I didn't realize that I had just discovered one of the best sit-com series ever produced. <br/><br/>The cast is incredible: Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Shwimmer made me spend memorable moments. Their bond on the set was amazing, so much that you can often become part of their family. <br/><br/>It's incredible how starting from the simple idea of friendship the authors and the cast have created a cultural phenomenon, a new style of comedy.<br/><br/>I have a lot of fantastic things to say about Friends but I think that are all well-known. So if you haven't seen Friends yet, get you're remote and find a channel that broadcasts the show. You won't regret it! I've rated hundreds of titles on IMDb, both movies and TV shows, but this is the one and only title which I've rated 10/10. This show is unbelievably awesome. The story, the characters, the dialogs, the setting. Each and every thing about this show is awesome.<br/><br/>This is the kind of show that attaches you to the characters so much that you feel like you're living with them. From little problems to life changing decisions, you experience everything as a part of them. I'm not even American, yet I could relate to most of the situations, I laughed at every joke, and this show has plenty of them. At the end of the show I felt nostalgic for days. <br/><br/>I would definitely watch this show again, and again. I can only hope that a show better than this would ever be made. I came to know of this show just when I was about to finish 6th Grade in NYC, and though I was a kid back then it really make me realize that in every group of close friends out there, we can always find the things we see in this show.<br/><br/>The way Joey and Chandler meet and later on become best friends for life, the way Ross and Rachel keep misunderstanding their true love for each other but finally get together, the way Phoebe reflects on the small things in life that matter a lot, and how Monica is so passionate and caring about everyone...I think that does happen with most of us....and even those people who don't like the show, if they for once watch a few episodes then they'll know that it's right. And everything shown in this series is very realistic, like how a group of friends are always there for each other in every step, and how each one cares for the other equally...well almost :) It's just that personally I love this show, it helps me realize a lot of things that happen in our lives but we miss out, and I think, what's life without friends after all? I'm 28 now, and I still watch the show on DVD every single day without a miss....big thanks to the creators and the perfect cast! I don't know whether I should admit this, but I've always had a bit of an obsession with 'Friends'. From the moment it came out I couldn't stop watching it and I would love to have the whole 'Friends' collection on DVD. Although the whole Ross 'n' Rachel ballad was an excellent plot and I was happy when they finally got together  I've always been more of a Chandler 'n' Monica supporter  the fifth series being my favourite. ;0) Everything is extremely amazing about this sitcom, including every Joey/Chandler moment, Phoebe's flaky behaviour, Monica's obsession with cleaning, Rachel's tendency to cry at a drop of a hat and although I've never really been a big fan of Ross, he too has provided many memorable moments. I was very sad when this series came to an end. It seems that all the programs I like have come to an end at the same time! Never mind, there are always reruns.<br/><br/>If you're having a bad day, this is the perfect sitcom to watch. 'Friends' always cheers me up! And hey  even if you're not having a bad day, it's still the perfect sitcom it is the greatest sit-com of the story it seems they're friends of mine, i love them. i am Italian so i'm not very good to speak in English, but however i think that Joey, Chandler, Ross, Phoebe, Monica and Rachel are the most beautiful persons of the TV, because they are simple and funny,and they live their lives with passion and happiness. i know it's strange but i saw all the episodes, and now i want that the new sit-com "Joey" will be translated in Italian, because i love the character of Joey tribbiani, who is Italian like me.... unfortunately in Italy the episodes are on air only at 11 P.M. so it's difficult to watch it, but i try always to see it because it's too funny.... my vote? 10/10 I think that friends is the best show of all time. I don't think I've ever seen a show that I haven't laughed in, I wish that friends would go on forever and never end. Joey and Rachel are my favourite characters. Joeys so funny,the show wouldn't be the same with out him.Well it wouldn't be the same without any of them. I can't think of anything bad to say about the show at all. My favourite one is when they are trying to name all the states in 6 minutes and joey got 56 states hahah I laughed so hard. I cannot even BEGIN to say how much I adore this show. I never stop re-watching it because honestly, what's the point in starting a new TV show when you already know you've found the best one? So many people say that Seinfield is the best, but could that BE anymore wrong? Seinfield does not have the emotion that is in Friends. The characters are not even close to being as close as Rachel, Joey, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Ross. As a matter of fact, no one can be as close as that. I admire how the show always makes me smile the entire time. My friends all say I look like an idiot when I'm watching Friends because I'm always laughing out loud and grinning from ear to ear, and honestly, I couldn't care less. This show has changed my life. Literally. I love looking at Joey because OH... MY... GOD HE IS SO HOT. His kindness towards his friends and his sense of humor always makes me so happy. Joey is hands down my favorite. Rachel, and her growth throughout the show, is so strong and amazing. I loved how she went from the person who used her daddy's credit card to someone who works at RALPH LAUREN. Monica, and her cleanness always reminded me of some people I know, and a little bit of me too. Also, she was so gorgeous too. And Chandler, of course. His sarcasm and awkwardness made it impossible not to like him. Ross, who always manages to make me laugh because of his three failed marriages and his love for dinosaurs. He's so cute. And last but DEFINITELY not least, Phoebe, the spiritual quirky one out of them. The creator of Smelly Cat. So if you have NOT watched this show... what are you doing? Go watch it RIGHT NOW. Oh, and by the way, Ross and Rachel WERE on a break. I started watching this for learning English. I learned what is funny in English (or in the US perhaps) with this series. My favorite is Chandler. I cried so hard when I finished the whole series. <br/><br/>Now I can't even count how many times I watched each episode. The show is funny since the beginning. They use episode really cleverly in later episodes. So the more you watch, the funnier it gets.<br/><br/>I also like the way each character has strong and consistent trait. And the actors are just perfect for each characters. I can only see them as FRIENDS cast. <br/><br/>Just everything. Everything gets me! I was very hesitant to watch this at first because I know my mom watched it and I thought it was a girly soap Oprah that I wouldn't like or relate to but boy was I wrong. I've seen Seinfeld, The Office, Breaking Bad, Friday Night Lights and many other shows which are all rated high and none of them compare to Friends. This show will make you want to stop everything and constantly watch it. I finished it in a little less than 2 months which is pretty damn fast considering there is 238 episodes. I recommend this show to everyone, it is a MUST watch show that is life changing. You will feel like you're one of the gang by season 2. I remember years ago, as far back as say, maybe the year 2002, I was just starting to get into or, enjoy, rather, this TV series. And at that point, the show had been running for almost eight seasons. It was crazy. I didn't even get proper into the show until after it had finished (I think maybe late 2005, early 2006). But I became a big fan in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Skip forward, we're in September 2016. I have seen every season at least ten times each - the season I've watched least, is the first, and even at that I've seen the first season a solid nine or ten times. And I've watched the tenth season say, double that. And to no surprises, this show is indeed wonderful and it's definitely one of the greatest of all time. I know there are loads of people out there who will strongly disagree and would be adamant to change, but it's fine. Personally, the show just does it for me in terms of sitcom. It's a situated comedy with loads happening throughout. It has a good balance of six main characters and whatever co, and the episodes, while not always hilarious per say, are enjoyable, feel-good, or just real good to watch in general.<br/><br/>There are, as previously mentioned, and most people already know, six main characters. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross. While I'm at it I might as well mention that I do like all six main characters in the show - however, at times I find Phoebe to be rather irritating. I never get bored of the likes of Chandler or Ross, they're brilliantly funny, and Chandler is a genius-written character in my opinion. From favorite to least favorite, for me would be: Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe. But as I said, I like all of them.<br/><br/>The episodes are good from the start but they're definitely better, or get better, along the way. I mean, the first two seasons are great; but I would say 3-6 are the significant seasons. I also think the ninth season's a really good one. They are all watchable though, so that's good. And each episode's finale is good, particularly the last episodes for seasons, 4, 5, 6 and 8. The season finale for season 10, thus ending the entire series, is a good one, but not my particular favorite episode ever. I think for the most part, seasons 4 and 5 are the best.<br/><br/>Each episode gives something to the viewer (in my opinion). Either the episode will be seriously funny, casual but funny, plain old enjoyable, or situated with loads of things happening with some laughs along the way. Like I said it is sitcom, as you know, but yeah. And of course millions of people out there love this show, it's (well, was) very successful and spanned its own spin-off series, Joey. Joey not being so successful but some of the episodes were fine. It was a fine show. Nowhere near as strong or good or even enjoyable and entertaining as this show. Friends is the significant sitcom. I mean I haven't actually seen Seinfeld but match Friends with any other comedy or sitcom series, and it wins. It's just, the "go-to" comedy show. I like it a lot and although typically some episodes are less enjoyable and not merely as good as others, they're all okay, good, or great in their own ways. Friends is an absolute classic. It's still so funny. You can watch it over and over. Even if you're just getting into the series now, it's still an all time favourite and you will not be disappointed. Growing up on friends, It taught me so much about life and you'll find yourself saying the catchphrases all the time. Each series just gets better and I'm so glad that there is 10 series but wish there was more. <br/><br/>Pros: hilarious, lovable characters. Cons: not enough episodes. <br/><br/>I think the only thing that comes close to friends is the bang bang theory. But friends is a Must watch, fans of Big Bang, how I met your mother and king of queens will love this. "Friends" is the funniest show in the world, and after seeing every single episodes, it's hilariously funny, it's so beautiful, heartfelt, hilariously romantic, and very accurate, Jennifer Aniston is phenomenal, Courteney Cox is amazing, Matthew Perry is stealing the show, Matt LeBlanc is fantastically funny, Lisa Kudrow is astounding, and David Schwimmer is perfectly funny. This is the #1 Show to watch, that will make you laugh and cry :) Friends is the only tv series that you can watch over and over for as many times you can and still you won't get bored. I LoVe It. iTs sO gOoD. I lOvE iT.nejsjsjeejnjnjenddjjsdnnejnxejxne Amazing and fun all characters are wonderful :):):):):):) This is the best show/sitcom ever!!! Always a great show to watch!! "Will be there for you", impossible don't think in Friends, right? This serie is about a group of youngers friends living in Manhattan, New York. It shows all the problems that youngers have, like get a job, relationships and living alone. The first episode of Friends tv show happened in September 22, 1994 and the last one was in May 6, 2004, and since then is a success.
In the serie, all begins when five friends (Monica, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Joey) are hanging out at Central Perk, a coffee shop, when out of nowhere showed up a woman dressed like a bride, named Rachel, a situation that scared everybody in the group. Since then, Rachel started living with Monica, who is a chef cook and sister of Ross, who is insane in love with Rachel. Ross is a paleontologist, so you can imagine that he loves dinosaurs, right? Well, he has an insane love for that too. Joey is an actor, not so good, who suffer a lot, because doesn't get roles so easily. The other guy, Chandler, is the comedian of this serie, he is always trying to make people laugh with his jokes. The last one, Phoebe, is a girl who had a very difficult childhood, her mother killed herself and she had to live on the streets. This serie is great for marathon, each episode will make you laugh, it will cheer up your most stressful days. Make me very happy to have watched Friends, because it makes me got interested in English, the same time that I was having fun watching, I was learning.
In conclusion, Friends it's a serie so good that you will forget the time and watch all day, probably one time to match won't be enough, you will want to watch more and more times. I think this show is extremely funny and relatable. I've watched it like 7 times and I never get tired! It is the best show ever .. when you start watching the show you will know and meet new true friends that will stick in your head for decades with all their wonderful personalities .. I just can't believe there are people still dose not watch it !!! This fun humoristic show I can watch when i'm happy or sad, when I wanna cry or laugh. Highly recommend watching this show. "Friends" is one of those television shows that you just can't define and not because it's so great and original that words don't exist to capture it, but rather because it's so ordinary and it succeeded.<br/><br/>6 twenty-something friends trying to navigate life, jobs, and romance sure doesn't sound original and it's not. It's not ground-breaking in any way except for the fact that it basically united and defined a generation for almost no explicable reason. Almost every single person who grew up with the friends, can now relate every daily occurrence in their lives to an episode of the show. The show wasn't even that realistic, but all of the actors added a warmth and accessibility to each of their characters, that we hung on to every word, found comfort in their flaws, and craved that they found what they wanted.<br/><br/>The characters weren't even that well written. In every episode you can find a contradiction to something they said or did in an earlier episode, and sure that will bother you for awhile but then the next week the friends made you fall in love with them again because the actors had that gift of connecting you to them.<br/><br/>There's a good chance that a new show like "Friends" will not be able to find the same success. So I say to the new twenty year-olds out there to start watching "Friends" because it just may capture your generation the way it did mine. I was quite surprised to see Peter Bonerz was one of the director's of this inane sitcom, which caters to the twenty-somethings of today.<br/><br/>I don't have any kind words to say about this pathetic populist pablum that passes for "hip" popular entertainment.  It's a show populated with dense morons playing your average dense moron---what a concept (ughh)!  The storylines are insipid, the punch-lines are predictable, and the acting is at about the level of a  high-school play.  Norman Lear, please come save us with something on the level of a MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN!, or something.<br/><br/>Was Seinfeld's departure the end of quality comedy on television? Well...I don't get it. How could this TV show become such an overrated hype?...it's because people are just as stupid as this show is.<br/><br/>The whole thing about the show is just ridiculous and it simply fails in every simple category -the writing is pretty bad (kind of dumb punchlines along with some unfunny sarcasm for every joke...) ,terrible characters recycling every other sitcom's characters and bad plots (uninspired and unoriginal in everything...) ,not mentioning the terrible direction and awful cast which is unconvincing and unfunny at all.<br/><br/>And besides -it's not even funny at all ,it's even impossible to crack a smile out of it...it's pure garbage ,a comedy without a comedy and a comedy without any humor at all... <br/><br/>In conclusion- lame excuse for a sitcom: uninspired bad plots with unfunny terrible writing...pure garbage. Friends is neither so unfunny that I switch channel, yet nor is it funny enough to ever make me laugh out loud. At best, I'll chuckle, but that's as far as it goes. The dialogue consists of 1-2-1 exchanges that with almost clockwork precision result in one of several "quirky" expressions, most commonly the much copied "sh'uh right" from the infinitely funnier Wayne's World. Its that, or its Phoebe's expression of disgust, "Y'eugh". You get the idea. The comedy is built around this predictable exchange, with the audience no doubt cattle prodded into laughing, or paid. Over the years that the comedy has run, attempts have been made to develop the characters, and I believe this was directly in response to the masterful writing in Frasier, which managed to combine complex character and relationship development with laugh-out-loud humour. But Friends failed to succeed in developing either the characters or their relationships. Rather, what we were presented with were teenagers in adult bodies, 'playing' at being adults. And in a sense, for people who love this comedy, it perhaps represents a 30 minute opportunity to identify with this and its opposite, namely being 20 but living the life of a 30 year old, or being a 30 year old, and remembering back to when they were 20 fantasising about being 30. In the latter sense, comfort can be found in knowing that they aren't the idiots that the Friends are, but at the same time, they have achieved a comparable lifestyle, whilst being able to fantasise that they too have achieved that lifestyle with the same level of ease as the Friends. Conversely, people in their 20s can fantasise that they too will be able to attain a comparable lifestyle with the same level of ease. Herein lies its success but simultaneiously its weakness, that contributes to the general lack of substance that characterises this show. Life, especially in the city, is often about struggling, and indeed, it is in the struggle from which much comedy is born: the struggle to find love, the struggle to find work, or in my case the struggle to find Friends funny. Friends is a hugely but inexplicably successful series...I hesitate to call it a comedy because this would be to imply that it is funny. It is not. Put it this way: I can watch Friends, and effortlessly hold a straight face. It simply is not funny. The paradox, however, is that aside from Matt Leblanc, the cast have proved themselves elsewhere to be excellent dramatic and comic actors. But you would never guess it from watching Friends. I was glad that Friends finished, only to realise that there would be in eternity of repeats to avoid. I can only hope that Arrested Development is given a new lease of life on HBO, that Kelsey Grammar and gang return to a new series based around Frasier Krane, and that the new seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Rescue Me start soon. These are shows against which Friends is eclipsed and soon forgotten. IMDb TV ratings are insanely suspect, but downright laughable when it comes to this particular TV series. This is a mildly amusing rip-off of the famous show about nothing otherwise known as Seinfeld. Stealing a premise would not have been a big deal, after all there are only so many premises for TV shows, but the amount of stolen story and plot lines, sometimes down to the same camera shots is incredible. The ultimate downfall for this show however is the completely untalented principal cast. These have to be the worst actors ever assembled to star in a sitcom. Awful delivery of most the lines, where most of the dialogue, is set-up - punchline, which is where this significantly departs from Seinfeld and reality.<br/><br/>The popularity of the show is understandable, after all, it's a pretty girl/pretty boy soap fest of a show but the critical acclaim is baffling indeed. I have never seen a tv show that was so perfect. No wonder everybody loves this show. I have been watching this show for all seven years and have never failed to laugh at the jokes that are used in it. All the characters are so lovable, especially Joey and Pheobe, who are my favorites. Ever since the first episode i knew this show was going to make it. It always has me laughing, even the re-runs I've seen a million times. I am a still a teenager, and all my friends love this show. Even my 9 year old sister likes this show. Which is weird, because my parents enjoy this show too. This really is the perfect show for everyone. I love it to death, and I love all the characters and actors, I could not live with out them. I had given a 9/10 if I hadn't reached the end of season 4. The series ended there. They ruined two characters and the whole show. It went from an incredible comedy series that made me feel good, to a series that shows what most people are, selfish, stupid and self-centered.
It is a pity. BEST SHOW EVER IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION....
End of the debate. I watched it 9 times and i still Love this Show. Its a piece for every Mood. Friends and one of my favorite series is the story of a group of six friends where we discover their way of life, their adventures and their bond of friendship. I watch it since I was little and I do not get tired of it is a funny entertaining series that we can watch at any time and with family Can't remember any other time I didn't want a sitcom to end. Watching the last episode is hard to believe it's the last time you'll see the gang together. Show does a great job of keeping a wide array of episode themes throughout its 10 season run. You fall in love with the cast and this sitcom is simply a staple in American Television. Have rewatched the series 5 times and I own the entire DVD box set. This was before Netflix was a thing lol. If you haven't seen Friends yet you have to check it out. It's one of the best if not the best sitcoms in a lot of people's eyes. This show will not be eliminated by time
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 I am watching friends for the sixth time and i still can't stop laughing even though i know what is going to happen.Once the six of them get into our lives,the will become our friends,family and more than that.After finishing the whole seasons there will be a feeling like our family,who has been with us all this times keeping us laughing or crying left us,and there will be a pain in our heart....... I have watched Game of thrones, Breaking bad, Daredevil, Hillhouse, Titans, Nacos but believe me this is the only Tv i enjoyed the most! I only watched 3 episode and my hands were iting to give it a 10/10 and write a review! I was smiling all the time when i watched episodes! I can already tell, i am going to miss this series like hell when i finish it If you just wanna laugh, this is a great serie!hdhdjdjdjxjjxjxjdjdjjdjd Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends. I've been reading a lot of these comments. Some people don't like the show...claiming it to be unrealistic or that the plot lines get boring.<br/><br/>I didn't discover Friends until a year or two ago (thanks to MY friends) but I ADORE the show in syndication and I hope to own the DVDs. Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL.<br/><br/>Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.<br/><br/>This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS.<br/><br/>We may not all sit in coffee shops, but we all LOVE our friends like they were blood. That's what this show is about. Makes you all warm and fuzzy (and sore from laughing) inside. And as a show: FRIENDS will always be a part of MY family. This is the first TV show I have watched every Episode, every moment without feeling boring!! Even still now I am watching the old Episode again for the second time. I love Joey and Chandler so much!! <3 This is a full pack of laugh out loud. This is the best show ever. and before "Friends", the six actors who play the main characters were all unknown. Today, Jennifer, Courteney, Lisa, Matt, Matthew and David are six of the most known people in the world. Guys I'm so exited to the reunion on 2016 February.its been almost 12 years of break,but they were like my childhood friends.if you grew up with them you will understand what I'm talking about,you will understand every joke,all the excitements,all the popularity and trust me its is fair rated 9.0 on IMDb by the users.i watched it 3 times every single season.i even have there pictures hanging on my wall.it is very funny,romantic and the writers are brilliant.every single of the character is super talented,every fan of friends can see that the characters represents our actual friend or ourselves in our life.whenever I'm in bad mood i watch them and i relax and feel like they are my real friends and they are always there for me.sometimes i wish i have friend like them.the show is amazing.watch it.. This show is very easy to grasp- I remember being 10/11 years old on a plane to England from Australia, and laughing at Joey acting (whilst acting) in a Hospital bed. I thought Friends, especially Joey, were SO funny.<br/><br/>at the age of 17 and beyond, now 23, Friends became increasingly predictable and dull whenever I see it, and its formulaic plot. All the characters are stereotypes, who in reality wouldn't get on at all- well, I don't buy Pheobe as a friend of the girls- why would someone so laid back prefer to hang with materialistic anxiety ridden work-obsessed, over other like minded "boho" people? Each episode falls ass backwards into the old jokes- and only dumb people, or children, will miss this (they are the audience for the show, just look at education statistics in the USA, and it will be explained why this show is so popular there)! <br/><br/>Pheobe singing on her guitar with stupid lyrics and a simple melody "littlestar, hello there, furry and kittens love your blonde hair" or something stupidly simple.<br/><br/>Ross and Rachel playing hard to get, whining.<br/><br/>Joey making an "italian joke" by talking about food, eating lots of food, saying "I'm an Italian so I eat lots of food." Cue the Laugh Track.<br/><br/>Chandler and Monica being anxious and acting more like Brother and Sister than lovers.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston wearing fake nipples under white jumpers- again and again. WHY would she be made to wear "see through tops" with those plastic nipples? Isn't that KIND of distracting and inappropriate? Even Seinfeld make jokes about women who do that! Same with sex and the city! Really, it was pathetic, and made me disrespect Aniston more for just being a bimbo- on TV, and off. She can't act, so they had to make you forget that fact.<br/><br/>Joey being a "Male Bimbo/Mimbo (Seinfeld word)" and doing a silly acting job.<br/><br/>This show is outdated, sentimental mix of soap opera and a sit com, as oppose to Seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm, which are strictly sitcoms, and had a No Hugging policy- they also didn't care about making the Seinfeld characters look "sexy", just funny! Where-as on Friends, the actresses would have hair dressers on call between takes to brush their hair perfectly before the cameras were allowed to role. While Pheobe and Monica were quite comedic, Jennifer Aniston, the vainest woman on the planet, cared more about being pretty than being funny.<br/><br/>If you want love stories and drama with comedy- watch sex and the city- its insightful and far more intelligent than friends (besides the product placement, its fantastic). If you want pure laughs that never date, characters to relate to, and a show that makes you feel happy about your life in a Ce La Vie fashion, watch Seinfeld. Friends is one of the worst television shows I have seen in my entire life. Heck this show even has a history for vulgar jokes. I mean there was once an episode where Chandler accidentally walked in on Rachel in the shower and saw her breasts. Rachel acted like a little kid and decided to see his unmentionables as retribution. Where is the humor in that? Another time I think it was Ross and a girl talking about protection, and all of a sudden Ross starts mentioning something about bears. What the heck was that all about? Then another time at Thanksgiving the gang played a game of football and it had serious implications regarding the Thanksgiving turkey. These are just some of the reasons why this show sucks. For ten years hundreds of people have tuned in every Friday night to form their friendship with the six characters everybody knows.<br/><br/>Everybody has their favourite characters, be it Monica and her crazy habits or Joey and his essence of sweetness. All the cast are truly amazing together all their talents bouncing off on another.<br/><br/>Its hard to imagine what Friends would have been like without a certain character or a different actor playing the role, would the show still have had the same success? Would it have even made it past series one? Each actor brings their own 'uniqueness' to their character, everything from the way they deliver their lines to the facial expression they wear, shows their unique talent.<br/><br/>The writers must be truly talented to keep the comedy fresh and exciting, whilst still remaining true to the show and the ideologies behind it.<br/><br/>Friends has changed television since 1994, making the public more open about topics such as sex, which before then was discussed 'behind the hand' so to speak. It appeals to an audience stretching over generations and continues to do so, there must be some genius in that!<br/><br/>It is one of the longest running sitcoms and is Warner Bros' biggest American show since Cheers. In my personal opinion it will take one heck of a show to upstage and out run Friends.<br/><br/>Its a congratulations to all the cast and crew for making the show a complete success in more ways than one.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen one episode (I think you're lying) you must see at least one episode, I'd recommend you start from the beginning, you've got a lot of catching up to do. I never saw FRIENDS, I only got to start watching it when it came out on DVD. Now I am addicted. It is the funniest and smartest sitcom I have ever seen. To me, if you can get addicted to a show after buying the first season, that is saying something about the show. The plot line generally stays together, there are a few hole here and there, but for the most part it is easy to follow. The writers use all forms of humor when they produce the script, so the show can appeal to everybody. That is what is so great about the show. The actors are tremendous in what they do, and they really know how to pull off physical comedy. I have seen a lot of shows that use physical comedy and very few actors can pull it off. It always looks staged. That is one thing FRIENDS never looked, staged. You felt like you were being pulled into their world, and that you were there silent friend just observing their lives. I love this show, and am sad they will longer be producing any more episodes. By far, Friends would have to be the best TV show ever! It contains the right amount of comedy, mixed in with the right amount of drama and finally adds the world's best cast members! Rachel Green(played by Jennifer Aniston)starts off being a spoiled former popular cheerleader, who ran out on her wedding and is trying to get by in Manhattan. She leaves the show as a successful Ralph Lauren employee with a baby and the guy,who she's gone down a very bumpy road with but always loved(also the father of her baby), Ross Geller. (drunken mistake) Ross Gellar(played by David Schwimmer)is the nerdy but somewhat cute professor. He has been in love with Rachel since 9th grade. He also has been married 3 time: 1st divorce-> wife was a lesbian 2nd divorce-> said the wrong name at the altar and 3rd divorce->(ANOTHER)mistake in Vegas(wife=Rachel Green) He also has a son by the 1st wife and in the last season has a daughter by Rachel Green.<br/><br/>Joey Tribianni (played by Matt LeBlanc) is the sexy but not so smart Italian actor. He always makes the audience laugh with his ditsy jokes. He does not have a constant job. Basically he just goes from job to job to make rent.<br/><br/>Chandler Bing(played by Matthew Perry)always uses jokes as a defense mechanism. You can easily see why considering his background: parents are divorced, Mom sleeps with every guy in sight, Dad is a women, everyone thinks he's gay and he does not get many women.Despite all this, he ends up marrying a very pretty women, who is one of his best friends and one of the main characters, Monica Geller.<br/><br/>Monica Geller is Ross Geller's obsessive compulsive sister.She always wants everything neat and clean.In high school,Rachel Green was her best friend and Monica was extremely overweight.Now, she's sexy and skinny and married to Chandler Bing.<br/><br/>Pheobe Buffay(played by Lisa Kudrow)has hardly any family. Her mom killed herself her dad waled out n she doesn't talk to her sister. She had an early life of living on the street and begging.everything works out well in the end,though, because she marries a wonderful man named Mike.<br/><br/>So, whether you are the nerd, spoiled popular cheerleader, the ditz, the Ladies's man, the class clown, or the obsessive compulsive one, you're going to love Friends! I absolutely LOVE this programme. It's the best show ever, it beats any other show. My favourite "Friends" are Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) I could watch this show for days on end. It will be sadly missed when it ends next year, but I hope they will continue to play the repeats! I enjoyed friends and have never missed one episode.  It is all about love and friendship, about four close friends try to make dreams realities. By the way, if you are a Friends fan, you gotta buy the DVD series - 2 seasons have been released. With a few exceptions, I've long ago given up commercial TV. With a collection of more than 500 DVDs and access to Netflix Instant View, I'm not dependent of the networks for entertainment, although I have some TV shows in my collection.<br/><br/>"Friends" is among the reasons that I've abandoned commercial TV. The show goes nowhere and it lacks the tact and daring of HBOs "Curb Your Ehthusiam, " which NBC progenitor "Seinfeld" explored to great success.<br/><br/>Words such as "brilliant" and "awesome" have been used to describe mediocre "Friends." The program's main draw comes from male viewers who want to look at the attractive female stars, and they tune in each week to whet their sexual fantasies.<br/><br/>Female viewers use the female actors as to serve as models. They want to look like Courtney Cox and the others and keep up with clothing and hair trends. What takes place between is jejune filler.<br/><br/>I hope that foreign audiences who watch "Friends" do not assume that all American twenty-somethings live that way. I for one, am not the type of person that likes to watch the same movie/show over and over... (unless it's one where it requires a secondary viewing due to a complex storyline) but this is one that stands out. I have watched the same episodes at least 6 times now and I have laughed at every single joke repeatedly. I love the characters and how each person has it's own distinct personality. You will have to watch it to see just how amusing the plots can get.<br/><br/>Over all, I will give this show a 9.5 out of 10, the 0.5 that I took off is because the show is going to end. =( This show was labeled a comedy but it never made laugh even once.The premise of the show is that three women and three men are all best friends.The most unrealistic premise ever.For some reason they needed to have two stupid people and they were both in the entertainment industry.That's the only realistic thing about the show.Anyway, the majority of the show is about them all having sex with each other and drinking coffee.Except when they flashback to the 80's, which happens in about half of the episodes.They flashback so much because the characters are extremely boring and they need them to be different for the show to have any content.You get beaten over the head with "one of us was fat" and "one of us was a nerd".It's truly pathetic.This show is only for people who think Bill Cosby,Ellen,Rosie O'Donnell,Robin Williams,Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg are funny.Anyone who only likes real comedy will hate this waste of videotape.I would recommend never watching this.Trust me. Honestly, if you ignore the laughtracks in the background, you'll get the cringiest and stupidest thing I've ever heard (yes, I count Trump's speeches as well). Jokes are either really bad, or downright insulting/damaging (example: Joey complains his girlfriend hits him, gets told he's a wuss = toxic masculinity at its finest). Not sure how can anyone enjoy it, but then again, America is weird, I mean the Kardashians are somehow famous there... I think this is one of the most overrated series on TV. The storylines are just silliness (for the most part), and the actors annoy me. I am so tired of hearing about how "great" it is. I just do not get it at all. Maybe you have to be 15. I have seen like 12 episodes through reruns and I do watch these, only if they happen to come on, just to try to figure out how the pilot of this show was ever picked up. How it ever became the most popular show, or how it is still my sisters favorite. It is the the same phenomenon that propels the series Twilight. First and foremost Friends, should be listed as Fantasy and nothing else. No Comedy or Romance in the description for any reason. It attempts to portray what being like a grown up is to young girls, which according to Friends, is a clumsy and unsure of themselves girl, that has no career or any set goals and will decide when she is ready and who cares. In which women from 12-25, eat it up like candy. The series is set in Manhattan, well a sound stage in LA. Because they are only ever shown in rooms on the set. The apartments shown, if they were in Greenwich village, we would have to add up all the income of each 6 of them, without a single expense , and even that would not pay Monica's rent each month. You can't live in lower manhattan, just starting out, even with a roommate unless you have a real career or a trust fund. Cashiering at Central Perk, she would have to live with her parents and take the train from Jersey. It is not even trying to be believable, but yet the demographic believes it. With Phoebe, she has no job, randomly plays a guitar in a coffee shop and yet has her own apartment, in the same building, which is ridiculous. All the men in this are beyond emasculated, they basically all just play like a big dumb, confused, dope all the time, which the demographic loves. Men do not really act like this, men don't act like they are wrong all the time, and that they are that unsure of themselves. They do not approach any dating situation, like a 12 year old boy would. Gee, I wonder if I can even kiss her? Will I get lucky and finally make it to first base today? Please stop. Grown men do not act like this. There is nothing realistic amount any of this. Essentially all 6 roles are written based on a female perspective and essentially all 6 characters are females, they have decided to include the term boobies or something else silly from time to time, and did instill 50% of a man into each of the 3 male characters, or it would be like watching 3 straight girls and 3 lesbians. Men do not act like this, do boys act like this? yes, but not men. Everyone in this show is white, if anyone has been to Greenwich village while whiter than many places in NYC, everything is very mixed there. In A real coffee shop, a white would be a minority, every moment of the day. Seinfeld gets criticized because it is a show about nothing. Has the same issue, everyone is white, making it look like it should be set in a suburb of minneapolis and not anywhere near manhattan. But Seinfeld is really funny. I have never ever laughed at a single thing in Friends and I love comedies. I am surprised they have not capitalized on making another show like this again, because it is golden as far as ratings. The 12-25 female demographic will watch it, and think that real life actually works likes this. The only thing is, I would hate is to be the one, when they grow up, that tells them the actual real truth. i enjoy friends, more so coz its totally alien to me. within my friends group, there is a lot of informality and leg-pulling, but people dont blurt out personal comments at the drop of a hat....in the tv show, this seems to be the norm. if someone made so many cracks about me, or reacted in that way to something i said, i dont know how i would've taken it....wouldnt it get to be irritating after a while?<br/><br/>there are 2 ways of looking at this: 1, that americans are by nature more amenable to giving and taking sarcastic comments and they dont take these personally. 2, that this is just comedic license on the part of the writers of this show.<br/><br/>where does informality end and rudeness begin? the characters seem to have little in common, in several shows they've said to each others faces what they find wrong with the other......this is said in a spirit of irritation rather than honest confession.....so what makes them stick together? what makes them Friends?<br/><br/>i wonder if this is the reason why the writers keep making them hook up with each other...becoz in the end, they're left with little reason to keep them together. Before watching the show, I was very fascinated about FRIENDS. At least when you see the title making room in IMDb Top TV by 40, why shouldn't one watch it? But it finally turned out to be a very lame series. The thing that surprised me much, how & why in the hell it has so much popularity. I stick with the series till the very last episode. Depicting lives of a friend circle of mid ninety's living in NY. There is no particular story anyway. Most of the goofy shots, which are actually meant to be humorous, are too lame and too forced. Only few episodes were funny in the whole series. But that can't save the trip. To tell you the truth, it's over-hyped overrated show. If you are planning to watch it, after a few times later you will understand how worthless this series is. Usually I am not intended to write negative reviews. But in this case, I just can't avoid the fact that it's a botheration. i love this show with all my heart. i think i first started watching this show when season three was first showing on TV. that would of made me about ten years old, i was hooked. fifteen years later and the show has been finished for a while now and i'm still hooked. its literally a laugh a minute show that never got boring even for ten years. my favourite seasons has to be the mid seasons (four, five, six and seven) thats when the show was really at its peak<br/><br/>i love every character in this show. the guys are funnier than the girls but they all do a fantastic job. Ross is so funny as the nerd who has been divorced so many times that hes finding it hard to get new relationships. his nerdy acting in this really makes me laugh. Chandler is the joke master but has so many insecurities, hes a gem. Joey is the dumbest character in any programme but is a girl magnet and is probably the funniest in the show. Monica is Ross's sister who has too many problems such as her cleaning habits. Rachel is also a brilliant character and always adds something brilliant to each episode. last but not least there's Pheobe who is a weird street smart psycho in my eyes. her stories of her past makes me laugh so much. what makes this show so amazing it the situations these characters get in to through the ten years the programme went on for<br/><br/>this is a show i watch all the time.... i also love Simpson's the same as this but this show will never die in my eyes. once i get through all ten seasons like I've done so many times i just watch it all over again ha ha ha, its true.<br/><br/>i think everyone must of seen this show. its on TV all the time but if you are living under a rock and haven't then i advise you to watch this classic. its probably the best comedy on television........... 10/10.........j.d Seaton I must have managed to sit through three out of five episodes of `Friends.' Why only three out of five? Well simply my stomach couldn't take more then that. But if I'd really hated myself, I would have tried harder.<br/><br/>
`Friends' is an overrated (and typical modern-day American,) sitcom about six roommates living in a flat in (surprise) New York. They got into stupid situations, thinking they were funny the whole way through, but funny they weren't. The script was unintelligent, the acting was amateurish, and the stories were such bores. The whole show seemed so useless and I will never understand how anyone could have such lack of brain as to watch this contemptible excuse for TV entertainment. But I guess most people are too sheepish to think for themselves,  just as they have been when it comes to the craze over such shows as `Sex in the City,' `Will and Grace,` and `Frasier.'<br/><br/><br/><br/>`Friends' is simply a bad show, for a country that has lost it's sense of humor. I'm sorry I have tried to really like this show. Its simply not funny. I can't get through more than 20 minutes. I think Jennifer Aniston is overrated. Matt LeBlanc has no talent. THe only possible actors outside of this show is Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer. Everyone else only works as team.It took em eight plus seasons to add a minority to the show.The cast is going to suffer from Seineld jinx after this. I am surprised to see so many bad reviews of this show.  Will let me ask you this, "know-it-alls,"  Why is it the top rated show in all of America?  And don't say it's not because it was the number one show in television this last week.  A show in its 9th season, and still number one.  I'm sorry but millions of viewers aren't stupid like you're saying they are.  The show is just for pure fun and entertainment, and truthfully gets me through the day sometimes.  I have purchased all the DVD sets and watch them over and over. Not many other things can make me laugh and smile after repeated viewings. People that are analyzing things such as why no one else sits in the chairs/couches at the coffee  house, not knocking on doors before walking in, so on and so on have obviously NEVER seen a tv show in their life.  All TV is like that!  We like friends because of the familiar setting.  Imagine how uncomfortable and time-waisting it would be if they always knocked and waited to be let in the apartments, or sitting at different spots at Central Perk.  Well whether or not Friends ends this year, we will always have 9 great seasons that are priceless.  <br/><br/>And sorry to the "cynics," but Friends will more than likely never disappear like you desperately claim you want it to.  Such popular shows get shown in reruns, and Friends already has top marks on TBS and other channels. I didn't care as much about the series in the first 2 seasons, but<br/><br/>after that I loved it. Friends is unbelievably funny with the best<br/><br/>jokes.<br/><br/>I have not seen all the newer seasons and honestly I don't much<br/><br/>like the idea of Joey and Rachel.  But it's still a very very good<br/><br/>show.<br/><br/>I think they should finish it soon before it gets like The Simpsons<br/><br/>which I now find the worst T.V. series on T.V. because they didn't<br/><br/>call it quits sooner.<br/><br/>The entire cast rules and all for different reasons. The series has been terrific all so far, and I hope they have a great<br/><br/>ending.<br/><br/>Friends is an excellent show and I wish everyone could enjoy it as<br/><br/>much as I have. I almost wish I could forget each episode so I<br/><br/>could watch it again and again and again!!<br/><br/>Friends is definitely 10 out of 10! Friends is my all-time favorite TV show, never miss it, not even the re-runs. In this show, you see mostly dramatic adulthood problems, but what i love about it is that non of them are taken very seriously. The jokes are very smart, and really funny, and each of the characters has his or her own special thing. Rachel is in to fashion, Monica is obsessed with winning, keeping things organized and having a baby, Phoebe is mostly a freak, who has her own way to look at life, plays the guitar, and talks about her weird family a lot. Joey is an actor who is sort of a casanova, and sort of ignorant, Chandler is the clever one, with most of the jokes, with some personality issues, and Ross is the one with the PhD, who is a teacher and loves dinosaurs, but is a real relationship loser, especially with marriage. All of these life problems keep you interested, and make you feel like they're your friends, they make you feel right at home. Great show. 10/10. Friends is one of the most amazing sitcoms in television history. While half hour comedies come and go, FRIENDS remains a top rated series for almost seven seasons.WHY? you may ask. Well, first lets look at the cast. All six actors are not only extremely talented but work well as an ensamble. They " the cast" have often admitted that they liked and cared about each other. This makes for flawless performances. The series true star COURTENEY COX shines in each episode by always reaching and holding on to new comedic highs and powerful dramatic moments. The entire cast show a vast range of talent. The only problem that I can see with the series, is the constant intrusions by guest stars. What NBC fails to understand is that this series needs no Hollywood celebs. to get high ratings.<br/><br/>Behind the scenes are the shows un spoken hero's The WRITERS. Television is like a shark, it eats material. It takes the most wonderfully gifted writers to crank out, 160 episodes with the quality that this series has.  Alas, after next season the show must end. Friends, television at it's best. When I first saw this show I hated it. It gave me the impression that it was a bunch of spoiled out of touch hipsters living in an expensieve new york apartment. However my roommate, who happens to be older than me actually liked the show. So I gave Friends a chance and after a while it grew on me. Specially when I found out Fibi Buffet was once homeless. Though her character doesn't act like anyone that was homeless that I've ever met even if they are now in a home. I found it a cute premise but still out of touch. Joey was cute and sexy even though they overplayed how good looking he was. He was cute but not handsome by any means and besides he was kinda short. Anyway, I watched it off and on for years but I am so sick and tired of TV stations playing this in re-runs over and over again. I'm now sick of the show again and hate it once more. I did go through a spell where I liked the show but I really didn't feel for any of the characters no matter how deep they tried to pretend to be. I still found them all fake and phoney. Now in 2012 almost two decades since the show started it seems that local stations are contractually obligated to play this series to death... or I should say way past it's death. There are newer fresher funnier shows like 30 Rock that have jokes and humor of today in 2012 and not from a decade that people don't act like anymore. I wish more TV stations would play newer shows like 30 Rock or something else. One reason I got rid of cable was the limited handful of reruns they owned. Don't get me wrong I love re-runs but there is such a tiny supply of shows on TV these days. On the internet there are hundreds of shows to choose from while that dinosaur TV hits us over the head with shallow peppy plastic shows like Friends. I don't care how deep they tried to come off that show was total and utter phoney garbage. Now who ever owns the rights to Friends is forcing the local TV stations to play them over and over again until we all die a little inside. I know I can turn the station or go back to the superior internet. But there are times when I come home at night and would like to turn on the TV and have them present me with something enjoyable, fresh, today, and actually funny. Sure the characters on 30 Rock come off as hipsters too but they meant to be hipsters, they are meant to be absurd. And that's what makes it funny. But Friends is so obnoxiously transparent I can't believe that it has the TV contracts that it does. It's a cute show but so aren't a lot of things. A plastic doll is cute but that's all it is. Plastic. If Friends were to disappear forever I for one would not miss it at all. If I ever see this show again it will be too soon. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippie chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show.Friends is a fantastic sitcom, probably the best of the 1990's. It is smart, snappy, colorfully and brimming with funny lines and excellent plots. Friends really shines with it's amazing cast. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are the friends you wish were your own. You can empathic with all of them in some way, and still laugh with them every week. It really is fantastic 'Friends' is unmistakably one of the best shows on television. Set in the Village area of New York, it is about 6 30-something Friends, their problems and how they deal with them. It has some of the best writers available and it has been one of the funniest shows in the last ten years!<br/><br/>I started watching this show since about 1998-99, and have been a vivid fan ever since! I don't fail to watch the new episodes every week and rarely miss the repeats in between!<br/><br/>But, like all good things, the show is ending, with this next series being it's last.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10. When I bought the 22 DVD collection of Friends covering all the episodes from 1994 up to 2000, I was not sure I did the right thing to pay USD 440,- for a TV series. But when I began watching...WOW...That was the best decision I made in my life. This is perhaps the BEST TV SERIES of the last 2 decades. And this is why the series have been on TV for the last 7 years. The most entertaining, full of sense stories got rich by killing jokes & powerful talents of all the six beautiful people & all the guest stars like Bruce Willis. If you're interested in understanding what young people think nowadays, you have to watch Friends. If you like to laugh & cry at the same time, watch Friends. ( And isn't this what a friend is for ? ) Friends is the best thing to happen to the world of comedy worldwide. I've literally seen the show from season 1-10 over ten times and yet it never gets old. The script, the jokes, the characters, everything was perfect!! I really into this show and its truly interesting. This show fresh my mind and bringing positivity. In every episode has different concepts and dialogues. F.R.I.E.N.D.S is best show ever. This show has everything that a good show has: excellent cast, amazing studios and a plot that makes you want to watch more and more. I like the fact that the episodes are short and the situations develop in an enjoyable way, allowing you to laugh and to connect with the characters. This show is about a group of friends that live in New York. At the start, the characters have bad jobs and horrible love lives. They experienced a lot together, supporting each other and trying to be better people, with a bit of humor and positivism. This show is very astonishing and highly recommended.At the end, you'll want to compare yourself to one of the characters and pick your favourite one. It will always be my favourite show of all time! I have watched all ten seasons all the way through many times and its one of my favourite tv shows and one of the best ever made. It manages to span 10 seasons but never lose the authenticity it had in season one, all characters bring something to the table. Highly recommend How you doin? How you doin?how you doin?how you doin? This is unarguably one if the best shows ever
amazing actors. amazing plot line. amazing writing.
the comedy, the romance, the drama, everything flows, it keeps you stuck, still after so many years it hasn't lost its comedic value Even after 15 years, Friends can still make you laugh and cry. We follow the six main characters on their journey and identify with the situations they face. It teaches you the true meaning of friendship, loyalty and love. No matter how you are feeling, happy or sad, it will always make you smile and be in a better mood. The show is funny, beautiful and inspiring; you don't want it to end. It is timeless. Best tv show ever!!!! Happy 25th anniversary ❤
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel, Joey and Ross will be forever in our hearts and memories! I'm watching the show all over again for the 4th time!! Oh.My.God !
Friends is always my favorite series! All Love I think i watched all the 10 seasons already 5-8 times and i still have to laugh again and again. I would have to say it is almost impossible to find another tv show to compete with Friends This is my favorite show of all times and have been for the last twenty years. I have watched this show through good and bad, it helped me through my parents divorse, high school and frankly rest of my important moment through life. I can't emphasize how much this show means to me. As my great grandma would say "genius". Its so good that you what see it more and more. You will connect emotionally with the characters in the show. They are amazing. Best dialogues are written by the writers you will be laughing very hard. If you are in a disturbed mood just watch one episode of this it makes you feel good. Its not only about comedy it has emotion,brotherhood,love, caring, sharing, friendship. It makes you a better person. Just like i was made better. Everyone must see this. It is suitable for every generation. This is the best series EVER, amazing show and humor The following are few reasons why this is so great!<br/><br/>The viewers relate to all of the characters in some way, as each character has their own funny moments that are unforgettable. Ask someone who their favorite character was on the show and I guarantee they will go back and forth a couple times.<br/><br/>Each episode focused on some sort of drama between the friends or drama that the friends had got into. I remember being able to watch the show and translate their problems into my own and figure out how to properly fix it.<br/><br/>The story line never gets old. I can still watch episodes and laugh, as the situations are still relevant. With story lines like trying to find your calling in life, finding the right kind of love, falling in love with a friend, how living with a friend can tear you apart and so on; these stories are still happening to a lot of us.<br/><br/>The characters life seemed so real and progressed on a very natural note. I feel like I grew with Rachel, Pheobe, Joey, Ross, Chandler and Monica as I watched all 10 seasons over and over. The fact that love is found between the best friends was always a thought that I had for the show, and really felt natural. Even after so many years since the last episode was in air i think they are number 1. Every episode i watched i simply enjoyed, laughing almost all the time. Simply the best!!! I'm happy 😃 to have the 10 seasons in Netflix, is my 4th time I'm watching, the show does not get bored I love each of the characters. Love you Ross 😍😆🎉 Best show forever i love them a lot Ever wonder why Netflix pays Warner Bros millions of dollars every year for the streaming rights to Friends? It's cuz even today, 15 years after that fateful finale aired, people still can't get enough of the ridiculous escapades of Chandler, Monica, Ross, Rachel, Joey & Phoebe. For ten years, week in and week out, the writers & actors delivered some of the funniest lines and most iconic scenes ever to grace the silver screen. No show will ever match the comedic genius of Friends, which is why to this day, Friends remains arguably the most beloved sitcom of all time. If you watch this series then every episode has something new to offer. You'll fall for the characters. You'll continue to watch the clips from all those episodes even after you finish the series. You'll fall in love with this show. You should watch it at least once in your life. Wow. I'm a new Friends viewer and only on season 4, but I just had to give a review. This show is honestly so amazing. I have never laughed so much (probably from the recorded laughs on the show though) and been so happy with a show. The characters and subplots are all so unique and hilarious. It is so great to see how these situations could be like in real life and what it really means to be a friend. Please do yourself a favor and watch it! This is the best tv show ever made. Watch it how many times you want, never disappoints. I'm writing this in July 27 2019, 15 years after since F.R.I.E.N.D.S had ended and I can say without any hesitation; IT IS THE GREATEST SITCOM AND TV SHOW OF ALL TIME UP UNTILL NOW.
The six characters made people around the world relate to them in a unique and emotional way that had never been done before, they're still loved and remembered and will always be like that.
10 years of comedy, laughing and crying, David Crane and Marta Kaufman made a MASTERPIECE.
I'm on my third time now watching the series and every time I go back and see it, it makes me feel like it's my first time.
I rate it 10/10 and truly it deserves 1000000/10.
Rami. I know what I am getting when I watch this show. Sometimes it can be extremely funny, sometimes it can be predictable and boring. The stories and relationships tend to become more absurd as the seasons go on.
It's O.K. I've been watching Friends for 2 years now and i rewatched it about 30 times. It doesn't get old. Best ever series before you die can see<br/><br/>Acting so pure and naturel Nothing else to say, really. Watched this at least 10 times. Everytime the last episode has ended, i put on the first episode and rewatch it again, again and again. If you dont know what to watch while eating, just put friends on and skip cooling down the food while looking for something okay to look at when you eat. These are my best friends <3 Sheer entertainment. This is something which be part of your life, your children's life and the life generations to come. Human relations so beautifully explaines. I will keep it short ,friends is a very good show but to mention friends in a same line with Seinfeld is insult to greatest show ever anywhere on this earth Seinfeld and even from far away in India we love Seinfeld<br/><br/>Friends was a good sitcom but certain characters like Rachael ,Joey and Phoebe were boring and irritating .personally in real life i will never want a girl like Rachael to be my friend .Joey had his moments but after a while his foolish behavior was not fun to watch,Phoebe was dull and her song smelly cat will make you to turn TV mute.i think strong points of this sitcom were the acting and characters of Chandler and Ross and Monica was average.<br/><br/>This show could have been much better if there were no emotional and that artificial oohhhs and aahhhs dubbed when someone had to feel bad or happy for the characters and also plot or storyline was repeated too much , like many episodes of friends were a same movie each time having different actors .at last it could be said friends was very very good but in rankings of greatest comedies it comes 11th and first ten places all go to Seinfeld. It probably isn't fair to judge this show when it has been off the air for several years but that is what the internet is for isn't it?<br/><br/>I like certain superficial things about this show. The female characters are all physically attractive. They have very shiny hair, beautiful faces, great legs, tits, and eyes. When Rachel is bustling around in her designer clothes I just think no one on TV has ever looked so good. I love Phoebe's bohemian style and her complicated hair-dos that must have taken at least two stylists to arrange. Monica is played by one of the great beauties of this or any era.<br/><br/>The male stars are appealing as well. Ross passes himself off as a nerd who never got girls but he is tall and handsome with movie star good looks and an unfortunate hang-dog expression. Chandler is funny and lively. Joey is a beautiful hunk and a great comic actor.<br/><br/>I also like the sets. I feel that the girls' apartment influenced a whole era of home design. The rooms are adorned with a lot of stuff yet they don't seem crowded. If I were a young person aspiring to the lifestyle these people lead I would have studied that apartment for inspiration and I'm sure many people did either consciously or unconsciously. <br/><br/>On the other hand there is much about this show that is hard to stomach.<br/><br/>The romance between Ross and Rachel was what sparked much of the interest in this show, but as soon as they were happy together all the spark died out. Since the plots needed to be contrived in such a way that they would long for each other but never have satisfaction, we were subjected to some really dumb stuff. How much can you admire or care about a girl who only wants the love of her life when he is in love with someone else? She shows up at his wedding to Emily causing Ross to blow his vows and never set things right. We are expected to follow along with her when she never did the smart thing and always did the dumb thing. I give Rachel and Ross 10 out of 10 each on the annoying scale.<br/><br/>Speaking of dumb things what about Phoebe? It is so hard to watch someone try so hard to be quirky and only succeed at being obnoxious. I realize that we are supposed to find Lisa Kudrow incredibly talented at playing someone so untalented but it just got old.<br/><br/>Maybe if this show had only lasted 4 or 5 seasons I wouldn't be finding fault with it. But then there would be a lot fewer zillionaires in the world wouldn't there? "Just turn it off" I keep telling myself. It is really sad that this show gets as mush praise as it does.  I actually read a user comment that this show was the best sitcom ever.  Guess if that comment came from a male or female.<br/><br/>Are there any women out there who find this show boring and totally sucky? I think it would take the common idiot 5 minutes to write an episode of this show.  How long would it take to write an episode of Simpsons,<br/><br/>Seinfeld, Wings...??  This show is about as clever and predictable as a Jennifer Aniston movie.  Oh wait, shes in this miserable excuse for a sitcom.<br/><br/>The talent of these actors rank up there with the uncanny ability of Julia Roberts to play such a wide variety of roles.<br/><br/>I perdict that the next pile of garbage called "Friends" will contain the following:<br/><br/>LeBlanc being an idiot and saying "How you doin." Aniston being so worked up about something so low and thoughless it makes anyone with an education higher than the third grade more stupid. Perry saying something sarcastic as "I know you are but what am I" Schwimmer saying "Awww Rach" I guess Cox and Phoebe just run around like morons. I cant wait till the day this show is gone from my life forever.  I would rather watch Mariah Carey's "Glitter" eight times, "Captain Ron" and "Weekend at Bernie 2" twice than sit through one ad for Must See TV.<br/><br/>Everytime I hear a girl say that Friends is the best, I feel sorry for all the women out there who seek intelligent comedy that must put up with listening to their peers babble about this show and how they hope that Rachie and Ross get back together.  This show singlehandedly sets the womens rights movement back two and a half decades. I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant.<br/><br/>I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be "The One With the Scene in the Diner". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichÃ©d and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile.<br/><br/>The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking.<br/><br/>I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection.<br/><br/>Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox What I definitely like about this show is that it is coming to an end and I will not see the face of Mr. Schwine ... Schwimmer again! <br/><br/>He's so miserable actor that he made the Rock looks like Sir Laurence Olivier to me. He is ruined almost every picture he's in. I cant say how much he irritates me. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is OK - my favorite ones are Matt Le Blanc and of course Lisa Kudrow ... but one (or two) swallows does not the spring make unfortunately.<br/><br/>What else to say ... If you want to see REAL comedy go watch some British sitcoms like Allo'Allo, Fawlty Towers, Black adder ... every single one of Carry on series... So the end is near.....hurrah. It's about time they cleared the airwaves of this drivel. One of the reasons I quit watching commercial tv was because of the overabundance of "reality shows". The other was because of shows like this, shows that claim to be about real life but one would be hard pressed to ever find lives like this in the real world. I have tried many times to watch this program because I hear how great it was but have never been able to handle it. I think the longest my tolerance level was able to handle was ten laughless minutes. If the system ranked television shows I'd have to give it a -5 out of 10. A negative for stealing away that 10 minutes. And for those of you who don't know what to do with your Thursday nights might I suggest that you get a life. I have never watched something so unfunny, fake and weird. I wanted to see what the hype was about and didn't stop watching it even when I thought that it can't get any worse. I saw all the seasons because everyone kept saying that it will get better. Well, it didn't. The characters are so fake (especially Joey). For the longest time I believed that I just didn't like sitcoms before I found some other shows that were actually interesting and in which the story was developing not only during the first two and the last two episodes of the season. Honestly, I don't get it. I sincerely do not understand why this show is so popular even today when we truly have some really good series and sitcoms. Its comparable with Seinfeld has great jokes but not really memorable they just live on how overrated they are and how die hard there fans are about these mediocre sitcoms but Seinfeld has the titular Jerry Seinfeld And George Costanza they're great they play off each other better than anyone in Friends.
Friends is decent it has at least one good joke per episode Joey and Chandler are great Monica is alight and Pheobe is iconic but the show focuses on the insufferable Ross and Rachel so much it ruins almost half the show.
If you want light fun that isn't too cringey like the office and doesn't have too much weight watch Seinfeld. Friends is overrated, cringey and worst of all absolutely worst of all it has Ross and Rachel's  scattered in every episode meaning there's hardly any episodes that are entirely good.
Will and grace, fresh prince these similar sitcoms are a bit better and aren't full of Ross and Rachel. Apart from being my favorite comedy show by far, Friends is an awesome series of how a life could be peaceful, youthful and be satisfying. As humans we were born in different places; had different experiences and this gives us our unique personality. Even though variations are wealth to this world, people have to understand specific things in order to be happy and deal with problems or to not to cause a problem to someone else. This series shows lots of examples in so many areas such as love life, health, career. And does show problems and solutions. Even though it is impossible to show all possible problem in this earth, this series can give people the main idea. Friends and family, people who could be trusted CAN help us and we SHOULD help each other (this is a fact we forget most of the time or we ignore people most of the time) ; in order to do that we have to accept each other first. No matter how different we are, with respect and understanding we can easily witness that all the behaviors have explainable backgrounds and their objectives are actually same in every human being. Consensus in a community is always possible. Loyalty makes relationships and friendships strong and keeps them satisfying thus happy. Our approach is also important too. Approach to other people and feed-backs we get from their expressions are vital for our social achievements. Those very different 6 people are good examples of all these because them being themselves didn't effect their life bad unless they forgot those rules and in the end being their selves directed them to someplace they didn't expect but would make them happy. It should be shown to every person. I didn't watch Friends until two years ago (thanks to MY friends). Its damn funny and no one can deny it.Ross and Rachel are made for each other that was a true love now they are getting old, How could it? Do relationships get old in real life?<br/><br/>This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change.<br/><br/>One of the best t.v. shows ever!<br/><br/>Everybody is so Good and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally. However, I do have my favorite characters, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it. After watching GOT's 5 seasons in for 3 months,i was looking to watch some comedy TV-series.I heard about this TV-series 'FRIENDS' from my friends a lot and saw some good reviews and ratings in many websites.And I'm a fan of both Jennifer Aniston from Just Go With It and Matthew Perry from The Odd Couple,so finally i decided to watch this popular series and i gotta tell you it is as great as everyone says it is.<br/><br/>My first reaction was 'Wow,Jennifer Aniston looks so cute here' i was blown,man.Every dialogue was brilliant and funny as hell and the character,Chandler can make jokes in any situation and his acting was marvelous.He is my favorite and i'd say he is the backbone of this show.I think the story is mostly about this character Ross who is a passionate paleontologist and bit confused about his feelings toward Rachel who was his high school crush and mainly the story starts by entering of Rachel in these guys life.This series is full of comedy and also shows how complicated relationships can be and in the end how it is worth all the troubles people go through.Joey portrays an ideal best buddy,womanizer and how dumb a man can be,he also shows us how competitive it is to work in acting industry.If you're a comedy enthusiast then u have to watch this series.It literally filled the whole in my heart that 'How i met your mother' left.They beautifully illustrated the love story of Chandler and Monica,it is really awesome when friends become lovers,well in some cases its a disaster.Monica's habit of organizing and cleaning everything made this show more funnier.This series isn't just about clever jokes and love stories,this story also demonstrates about how to build-up career from small to large.You'll see Rachel go from working as a waitress in a coffee house to working in a big fashion company like Ralph Lauren and Ross halfway to winning a noble prize.And no matter how late it is u gotta follow Ur passion,Chandler is a great example for that.You'll also learn how important friends and families are in anyone's life.All i gotta say is this show delivers reality of life through comedy and silly events,and i think that's what makes this show GREAT. One of the best comedies and characters out there which keeps me alive during stressful days. Its an addiction as well as memory u will never forget for your whole life. A must must watch for everyone. The stars include Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry. At its best, Friends operates like a first-rate Broadway farce, complete with slamming doors, twisty plots, and intricately strung together jokes. And even when it's not at its best, the crack acting and piquant punchlines give Friends a momentum and charm that win you over even if you're not laughing and finally LeBlanc is a rarity - a hunk with a gift for deadpan comedy . This the best TV Show ever made. I really love it. I can watch it over and over again and it never becomes boring. The jokes are universal and never get old. This show has made me laugh even in the most difficult moments. I've watched it through very hard times and maybe it helped me cheer up at some level. I remember back then when they begun to air it on TV in Bulgaria. I hated it, didn't want to watch it at all. But after some time I couldn't stop watching more and more. It's like a drug. I wish they could make another show that can beat Friends but I don't see it yet. Definitely recommend it to everyone who has not seen it yet, and to those who've seen it a couple of times too! Best sitcom ever!! I watch it at least once a year. From start to end. I somehow feel there is lot that can be related to from this series. And the fun they have which in turn viewer has is of the highest level. Ten year long uninterrupted coverage and successful telecast covers it anyway. Friends was a historic TV chapter. It had every thing for every type of audience. The cinematography improved with time. And direction improved too. The story line kept on audiences glued to this series. The connection between the cast characters was not parallel to any other sitcom. Hope it never ended or had little more to watch of it. So again, friends is the best sitcom ever!! Can't get enough of Friends.<br/><br/>This is the third time I'm watching Friends still it makes me laugh more than any other TV series. My favorite character is definitely Chandler especially because of the sarcastic jokes he make. When it comes to actresses Phoebe is my favorite. Can't say exactly why I like Phoebe the most but for some reason she is awesome. The acting of each and every character is superb. Most of the people watch the episodes here and there when it's broad- casted in the TV but that will ruin the TV series for you. Although there is no much of a story, you must watch the episodes in the order without missing even a single episode. Wish this had more episodes. This is one of those very few television series where 99% of it's audience could watch it over and over again and still laugh. Why? because it's brilliant.<br/><br/>Everyone seems to find "FRIENDS" very entertaining, and I believe it really boils down to the excellent writing. Yes the cast is brilliant and you do grow to love them all, but the writers deserve most of the credit when it comes to this show's immense success worldwide. <br/><br/>The interesting diversity of characters, (Rachel played by Jennifer Aniston, Monica played by Courteney Cox, Phoebe played by Lisa Kudrow, Joey played by Matt LeBlanc, Chandler played by Matthew Perry and Ross played by David Schwimmer) in this show also makes it possible for an audience to identify with, and rather difficult to have a favorite. <br/><br/>I love this show and it's no surprise that it aired for 10 consecutive years, won a Golden Globe, 62 other awards and had 174 nominations. Well done to David Crane and Marta Kauffman. I've watched this show for I don't even know how long, and I have NEVER seen a show that I love this much. I'm serious. The characters are funny; they're witty and fast and fun. Especially Chandler; like most, he's my favorite, mainly for his jokes (and the fact that Matthew Perry is so cute!) I have to say, I have friends like them. I'm a Monica; I'm obsessive and I love not only food but I love to cook (not enough to pursue a career in it, but still). That being said, I think that "Friends" brightens up my day. If it's one of those days when I have bad hair and am stuck out in the rain without an umbrella, this show is like chocolate for me; it's a luxury, but it's a reachable luxury. And I think that if you've never watched this show, you should give it a try. You never know what you might find interesting about it. For me, like I said, it's the jokes and the easiness and light-hearted situations and comedy. It's the relationships of Monica/Chandler (Mondler) and Ross/Rachel and even sometime Phoebe/Mike. For me, everything about this show is nice. so take my advice and give it a try. You may find a friend where you never knew you had one :) Not in the same league as Seinfeld, Frasier or Simspons but it's a solid niche filler for 15-25 age group. It's not written extremely well but it makes up for this weakness with a good-looking cast and keeps-you-watching season long story lines of rebounding relationships. Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc are extremely talented although they are generally let down by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Nothing groundbreaking, Friends success was on the back of a gaping hole in sitcoms waiting to be filled. While it is a quality show and raked in a huge amount of money, it's doesn't have the same sting of some other sitcoms of it's day. There's nothing more to say except that... THIS SHOW SUCKS!!!<br/><br/>
I'm glad that this show is going to leave the airwaves! As far as I'm concerned, all it is is a show with six losers going to the same damn coffee shop, with the same repetitive crap every single week!<br/><br/>
I don't get what the big deal is, and besides... I only have ONE favorite episode.<br/><br/>Everyone, do me a favor and snap out of it... this show isn't funny anymore. Friends<br/><br/>For 10 years i've lived with this show, as far as i can remember back i have been watching this once a week, taped a lot of episodes and collected them, this is by far the best tv show i have ever seen, and i ask myself now, will it ever be beaten? I think personally, no. Never have i been able to identify so easily with characters of a tv-show, never have tv-show portraited things without a deeper meaning with such excellence, this show is basically about the general life of 6 friends, and it works so well, even without a moral backbone, it just flows, it is perfect.<br/><br/>Having just watched the final episodes, i must admit, i cried, not so much because of a sad episode, but mostly becuase i was thinking how this ended an era, an era not only for me, but for many people out there who has come to love this show.<br/><br/>Over the years there are so many great moments to think back at, i've come to love all these 6 "fictional" friends, my weekly friends on tv. And man will i miss this show, it's unbelivable, over the years we have gotten to know these persons so well, we have laughed, cried and felt with them, this is a tv show that should never be forgotten.<br/><br/>Besides this i don't know how i would describe the show, there aren't really any words for describing it, it's the best show ever, that's how i feel, and i'm very sad that it is over, but i think they ended it well. Now i will collect the DVDs. Friends is one of the best show out there in my opinion. It is just a television show, and people take it to literally. Everybody who does not like this show, must be pessimistic in real life. If all they do is talk about how bad friends is they are pathetic. They need to not take this show so seriously. If you pick apart things (ANYTHINGS)that much you are definitely going to find flaws, so why look. The show is obviously not the "perfect" show out there, but nothing on this earth is perfect. This show is DISGUSTING! No wonder other countries think us Americans are so stupid...they watch Friends and think that everyone is like that. How old are these characters?, late 30s i'd say...and they act like 15 year olds!! They just sit on the butts all day and drink coffee and whine about their lives. Rachel is bitchy and mean, Monica is too skinny and she is too dominant, Ross is just a whiney pussy who needs to get his butt kicked, Joey is an idiot who looks like he is on drugs, Pheobe is a bimbo who needs a REAL job, and Chandler is too saracastic and looks like a crack addict.This takes place in New York and they never mention anything that happens in New York or the Yankees or any sports team or anything!! The writing is terrible and the jokes are NOT funny. This show should have been cancelled the year it came out. They only reason its popular is because teenagers don't have better taste, except a few like me, i'm a 14 year old boy. If you want true comedy or drama them tune into Frasier, Cheers, The Golden Girls, or South Park. They are all hilarious...Friends sucks!! This show has main characters who are horrible if they were real people in real life. Ross has a conceited entitlement complex, which causes him to be rude to Rachel. Monica suffers from perfectionism disorder that causes her to bully people if those people don't do things in a perfect way that Monica wants. Phoebe is crazy to the point where people are sometimes in danger around her such as when Phoebe traumatized Ross during Ross's childhood. Rachel acts spoiled and highly emotional most of the time that causes characters to feel uncomfortable around her. Joey is a philanderer that treats his girlfriends like sex objects more than respecting them. Chandler will use his humor to disguise his brutal honesty, which doesn't make me trust him at all. These main characters hang out in a coffee shop that looks kind of bland and lifeless except for the humans in it. Some of the scenes these main characters are in are somewhat dull and somewhat unamusing. Honestly, I had to skip the theme song of this show after a few episodes because it got boring and annoying after a while. From what I've observed, this show looks like a Seinfeld rip-off. On top of that, there are too many white people in this show despite the skin color diversity that existed in New York during the 1990's and early 2000's. Also, the main characters on this show hang out in an apartment that they would have not been able to afford in real life. This show is a fantasy show for white people. I don't like this show at all. There's nothing funny about it when the main characters are being unethical parasites to the other characters around them. A laugh track that is used in this show is ridiculous. Let the person laugh when they want to laugh instead of using a laugh track to tell them what is funny and what is not funny. Roger, the psychiatrist that Phoebe briefly dated, was the only character that could have the guts to prove how horrible these main characters in this show are because this show is not intellectually funny at all. You have to stop using your brain to find this show funny. I just finished re-watching Friends on Netflix, and I must say that the show still holds up pretty well. The first five seasons are undoubtedly better than the latter-half, which is more dramatic than the first seasons, but overall it's a pretty solid show.<br/><br/>The show was never as intelligent as Seinfeld, but the chemistry between the actors compensates that. My only complaining are the homophobic and sexist jokes. I know that the show is product of it's time, so I don't feel particularly offended, but I must say that Seinfeld which was from the same era, has aged far better than Friends on this regard(not that there's anything wrong with that!). Seinfeld didn't rely that much on gay jokes, so it has aged far better than Friends, other than that, Friends still is a pretty solid show. you might think that a show ran for 10 freaking years might not be as good as people say it is. But trust me, it is great. I have recently finished watching all 10 seasons(DVDs). And I must say that this has been the best among all these funny TV-series I have watched. The best thing about friends is that the more you see it the more you get to know and eventually start to like the characters! 'Chanler' and 'Joey' is probably my most favorite characters. And the acting is great. Another great thing is that the story of this series is great. There is always a few twist here and there.....as a result you don't get bored watching this even if you see 10-15 episodes in a row!! So, get to DVD store now or watch it on your cable....... I have seen Lost, Fringe, x-files and many more... but this show surpasses every single show on television..FRIENDS story line, every single joke they crack is just out of this world. The characters, the acting the timing everything is just too perfect...i recommend every single person to watch this show.. and besides the ratings it has... i give it 100/10. bcoz it deserves it and i dnt think in the next 100 years any show will be better than friends... And all those goons who didn't like FRiends i seriously say plzz have an appointment with psychiatrist.. u all seriously need. THE BEST... THE BEST... THE BEST...SHOW LUV u all-Monica, chandler,joey,ross and rachel I could never get past the concept of people with good jobs choosing to meet after a hard day of work and happily chattering, endlessly. They are always happy or warm. This formula is set in stone. This corporate branding does not deviate from message. It is just not at all credible in the least bit. My suspicion is that this series was targeted for young women who seek ultra-happy escapism, where never is heard a discouraging word. The only character that even remotely moved me was Monica, because she almost seemed to not be just a caricature at times. None of the other actors ever were anything but caricatures to me. Don't get me wrong, meaningless chatter can be great. I dearly loved Seinfeld, but I could never "get" why anyone derived enjoyment from Friends. I was so baffled, I sat through several shows from start to finish, and not even a tiny spark ever happened for me at any time. It wasn't funny. It wasn't clever. Character depth was virtually non-existent. What planet am I living on that people liked this? The combination of powerful writing and amazing performances of Friend's ensemble cast manage to give the viewer some mild to strong laughs as well as a bunch of other emotions such as sadness and compassion.<br/><br/>Not to forget the chemistry this magnificent cast has, the ability of the writers to give each and everyone of them a good storyline on each and every episode, etc.<br/><br/>You gotta love friends. Because from the very first episode to the very last one there is no way you can hate it. Every episode contains a great number of funny lines and great facial expressions and performances from it's ensemble cast.<br/><br/>I've seen a great numbers of sitcoms and I say Friends is on top of them all.<br/><br/>Both thumbs should be up when criticizing the sitcom Friends. Network: NBC; Genre: Sitcom; Content Rating: TV-14 (for adult content and suggested sex); Available: on DVD and syndication; Classification: Classic (Star range: 1 - 5);<br/><br/>Season Reviewed: Completed Series (10 seasons)<br/><br/>In the 1989 film "When Harry Met Sally..." Billy Crystal states that it is impossible for men and women to be friends without sex getting in the way. Looking back on a decade of "Friends" you'll be hard pressed to find a theme, point or sense of planning running through the show other than a feverish desire to prove this idea true to an entire generation. "Friends" is creators/executive producers David Crane, Kevin Bright and Marta Kauffman's commercialized, utopian New York fantasy of massive apartments, feminized men, Pottery Barn furniture and trendy clothes, in which 6 yuppies show us that the fun of college doesn't have to end when your work-a-day life begins. Riding in on the success of "Seinfeld", "Friends" is exactly what you get when a disposable time-filling sitcom, with a conceptually short shelf life, inexplicably becomes a huge hit. Where other shows failed, "Friends" was blessed with the opportunity to produce an obscenely mammoth 10 years of television and seemed unprepared for the task from beginning to it's predictable end. <br/><br/>This show is pretty much the definition of an assembly-line, network-contrived sitcom. The characters are vapid, filled in with the simplest 1-dimensional traits. Among the men he have neurotic Chandler (Matthew Perry), would-be actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and nerd Ross (David Schwimmer). On the female side we have the neurotic Monica (Courtney Cox[-Arquette]), the ditzy Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and self-absorbed star Rachael (Jennifer Aniston) - the quintessential post-feminist fantasy character whose big problems include clothes, great jobs, and her sex life. Aniston doesn't have nearly the acting chops to pull it off though. In fact, the entire cast is generic theater school caliber. Given a salary strike high enough you could have found 6 new friends on a street corner anywhere in the country. <br/><br/>People feel they can relate to the characters because (drum roll) they are all so widely drawn and broadly played that, of course, everybody knows someone like them. That's the point. Like a politician that poles his every move, nothing about the show feels natural. The dialog is a phony construction of obvious set-ups and punch-lines: one person says something, and then another person makes a joke out of a word the first person said. That's right, on "Friends" knock-knock jokes are what passes for high comedy. The show is lit and paced like a soap opera, dragging at 30 minutes each week. It operates on a rock-bottom level of the comedy that is consistently as timely and witty as a joke in a Bazooka Joe wrapper (how's that for timely). For me it is like watching paint dry. It never pulsates or comes alive but sits on the screen. <br/><br/>In labored attempts to please ever whim of it's audience, the running story lines herein are a mangled train wreck of breakups, love confessions, secret crushes, obnoxious boyfriends, quirky girlfriends, pregnancies and wedding cliffhangers. Ross, in particular, becomes an increasingly pathetic disaster entangled in a dysfunctional web of marriages and children.The series was built by committee based on demos, fads and ratings. It bends and shifts character focus with the prevailing wind. If the point of it all was to convince a generation that the only way to succeed is to just go with the flow and never challenge conventional wisdom - mission accomplished. Life, to this show, is a dull, repetitive and predictable cycle in which meeting someone, having sex, getting married and having kids (although not exactly in that order) are inevitabilities and that one cannot achieve happiness until all are met. <br/><br/>My theory regarding TV and the corresponding ratings is that, given time, quality almost always rises to the top. But "Friend" began as pure mediocrity and it rose to the top with just that. The show's slavish following is an utter mystery to me. I can see the need for the kind of escapist fluff. The stories are light, breezy, somewhat cute on paper and the show plays somewhat like a female "Seinfeld" in it's intentionally childish inanity. On principal, I'm all for it, but execution is another story. I'll even forgive the opening title sequence which is so upbeat and zany that it masks how ridiculous it actually is (I don't know... just get in the fountain and dance around a little bit). It seems that the show provides an outlet in which the viewers can gossip about people without consequence. The show is a true product of the celebrity tabloid culture. We are supposed to talk about Rachael's hair, wonder who will get together with who next and then "woo" & "ah" like Pavlovian dogs when it happens. <br/><br/>It is jam-packed with enough incestuous bed-hopping to qualify it as the ultimate Relationship Sitcom. The show might have gotten by as pure fluff, but the real nail in the coffin are it's attempts to give us something of substance. It's in these instances, where "Friends" turns into a sappy, soap opera-ish melodrama, that the show becomes such an insufferable bore. These moments swing wildly out of tone from the broad and childish nature of everything else going on. <br/><br/>'Friends' is just about as dull, witless and unimaginative as it comes. It might make a good starter sitcom for someone who has never watched TV before. As bad as this was, it's even worse to image the shockwaves resulting from this show and what it will inspire from future slacker sitcoms. We aren't going to know the full extent of the damage this show has done to the sitcom for years to come. <br/><br/>* / 5 This is a show for GenX-ers who are still clinging to their fond memories of the white-bread Brady Bunch. I tried, really tried, to like these characters and get past the predictably-timed 'laughs.' <br/><br/>And now, Friends reruns are sandwiched between episodes of the brilliant Seinfeld on TBS, but it's just another show - like Mad About You - to work at avoiding while trying not to miss Seinfeld. <br/><br/>A tenth year. What a waste. Friends... Regular story... No new concept... Just like other sitcoms. But there's just one thing about Friends that appeals to me more than any other sitcom does. The cast and their on screen chemistry! Seeing them together always brightens up my mood and don't get me started about the comedy! Extremely well timed comedy mainly from Matthew Perry's Chandler Bing and Matt LeBlanc's Joey Tribbiani! If you have some time to pass and wanna watch something that will make you laugh your lungs out and make you feel good, please consider watching Friends. Minus some minor plot holes and technical errors, it's a great show. Always simple, always fun yet always strikes close to heart. This show is without doubt the one sitcom that will never grow old.
Fact that people never say No to watching it no matter how many times they already have binge watched it, is a testimonial to how the show lives in their hearts forever. For a 25 year old show, in a world where you can find a new series of a new genre every other day in the zillions of streaming services available, That's saying more than required. I laughed with this, I cried with this. I literally lived with this series. Friends is an emotion actually. It is a classic even after so many years, numerous SITCOMs came after that but the nostalgia is still the same - Can I BE more in love with the series? YES!!! This series makes you feel like they are your friends, through the script, the dialogues , the jokes, the adventures, their lives , its like you are their friend... Every episode can make your day and they are all very interesting , making the characters evolve , get deeper, emotional, funnier... Directing is just as it should be. Casting couldn't be more perfect, not in a million years. Each season has an interesting subject and its very cosy and warm. The fact that they all hang out everyday, chilling without all this social media that we have nowadays to distract us, the fact that they have a stake cafeteria to chill is so dreamy. It is one of those series that you never get bored with and you will watch it again sometime and despite that, you ll occasionally watch an episode or two at TV. Thank you friends for being our friends... It's the best show ever when you finish it you will feel like something missing in your life ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ If you have never clapped along to the intro you have so much more fun to experience! Well what can i say .I keep watching friends over and over because of the bond and chemistry showed by all the cast .All did a great job but my fav character is Chandler ,he just does it so well every time ðŸ˜‚ ,his special bond of friendship with Joey is what friendship is all about .Friends gives and insight into a friendship that has its ups and downs but holding hands together in those tough times is what matters. I will say that friends is a legendary show which will always remain in one of the top spots on my list. Can't believe I only watched it this year. So many pop culture references. Could I BE any more behind? My first sitcom ever and I can never get enough of it, I never laughed this much ever in my life. These 6 characters held the show so beautifully that you will want to watch it again and again just for them. Probably the funniest thing you will ever see. I love it! After all these years, Friends still holds a special place in my heart. The jokes, the characters, the friendship, it's still a great show. Even though certain episodes haven't aged well, I think for the time it was first aired it was progressive. A true masterpiece that will never get old .
After the first couple of episodes you feel like you became a part of their friends , very warm funny series . I never get tired of watching it over and over . It will remain the best series of the century. You will fall in love with all the characters once you watch it. Surely it will take your a lot time because once you watch it you will watch in again and again. I honestly believe no other show comes even close to the comic or the realistic (everyday life) content of this show. Simple yet superb dialogues. It's a cult. Haha the people who are saying the show is garbage w out any imagination must be super fun people to be around.. that or they never really even watched the show. Friends is one of most cleverly written shows on the planet. Very smart writing and that's the reason for its success. The haters are either super boring people or they're lying about ever watching it it giving it a chance. If your are looking for a perfect sitcom with emotions you must watch this.bacically iam not a fan of sitcoms i even fun of people who watch these but after i watched friends i was blown away. Iam still rewatching the episodes and will continue to do it This is the best show I've ever seen. I just finished it and I know I'm gonna miss it so much. The characters, the action, the events - everything was amazing. If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should give it a chance. You won't regret it. Never get bored. Versatile characters and episodes and Chandler make it fun to watch. Good character development throughout, nothing too absurd (except Janice ofcourse). Overall feel-good show, good humour, also has a lot of guest stars in good roles. The series "Friends" is, in my opinion, an amazing phenomenon of its time. And this phenomenon is alive after two decades. After all, a huge army of fans does not dry up, but only replenishes with each new viewer. What began as a Comedy has grown into a life, a drama with excellent acting, a great story, and, most importantly, with characters you know as yourself, love and consider them your friends.<br/><br/>Each character from six unique. It has a rich history that we learn from series to series. Each character has its pros and cons, recognizable phrases, phrases, behaviors. But still their every step is unpredictable, and the situation in which they find themselves, just gorgeous to colic with laughter.<br/><br/>Anyone can recognize them if you give them a name. Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey. Each love and each is somehow manages not to make. That's good. Means,<br/><br/>the characters are cleverly written. They make you laugh, empathize, sometimes really afraid for their future. And so a series of for a series of the viewer imbued with this energy, is beginning to use their phrase in his life, are discussing heroes and situation later even years. Is this not worldwide recognition?<br/><br/>This is an amazing journey, where the viewer seems to be not such, living together with the heroes of their joy and adversity. The series raises important questions, but it is done in such a way that you understand for yourself that there are no hopeless situations. Every problem is solved.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. They are lively, dynamic, dramatic and of course funny. With them you wait for a meeting, they are ready to help in difficult moments when you revise series, you plunge into problems and really you begin to see the solution and the problems. "Friends" inspire.<br/><br/>A great solution would be to watch the series in the original with subtitles. You can learn the language and hear the real voices of the characters in all its glory. They are emotional and in any case more alive than in translation.<br/><br/>It's not just a series, it's a story about people who have become close friends for 10 years. "Friends" can be revised from year to year, when you want, when the mood is not very good, when you need Friends. Just Finished watching All 10 Seasons Of this Extraordinary TV Show ,It is the most amazing tv show ever. I completed watching all 10 Seasons In A Week, that's just how great it was, It's an amazing journey Of Joy,Emotion,Romance,Comedy and so much more that i just Can't describe it In Words . In Conclusion I would just like to say it has Been a treat to watch and I'm going to rewatch it Again Sometimes,Thanks To The Wonderful Cast Ross,Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe for giving us a such a great time ,In a way they are all our Friends, It's a Show we all can relate too ,At last i would just like to say Thank You Friends!! For a Entertaining us For a Decade A series that makes you laugh, cry, smile, happy, sad, and what not. It has every emotion to offer. Every bit of it seems so relatable at some point. All the characters portray some part of your life and behaviour.
Definitely a must watch at any given point of time. It's a really really great TV show. The friendships between the characters are so lovely. Simply love it and good to watch it when relaxing. A real friends fun! 😍😍😍😍😍😍 Comedies are not always my thing, but I cannot get enough of Friends. I've seen every episode like 100 times. No joke. I hope We're always able to watch it! Watched it 3 times, chandler(Mathew Perry) is the best Watching the same episodes again will only increase the laughter. Such is the class of this show. Best sitcom ever made I wish one more season to make 🙏🏻 The show is great 👍🏻. I just wanted to say that Ross is the worst character of all time👋🏻🙏🏻👋🏻👁 If you're dead by heart, watch this.... I assure you'll live your life again.... You'll smile again.... For me this is the best American sitcom hands down, from episode one you can see the camaraderie between the characters and it remains strong right until the series end and beyond. Unlike many other shows Friends manages to find the perfect ending to the series despite the writers actually intending to end the show several times prior. The show is still reaching new generations of people and will stand the test of time for the foreseeable future. It's best series ever made !!! I started watching it a months ago like 15 years later after it's official end. God ! I am so thankful to all the guys who made this series. I really consider myself as luckiest person that I watched it before I die. It's been unforgettable journey. End really made me cry ... It was so perfect and so emotional. There will be NO REPLACEMENT to this series ever. This show teaches us meaning of love and friendship. I really thankful to the cast Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer for giving this incredible experience of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. The best show in the universe. It makes you cry from laughter, cry from sadness, cry from... idk BUT IT'S THE GREATEST SHOW!!! MUST WATCH IN ORDER TO BE A FUNCTIONING HUMAN!!!!!! Everyone of all ages love this show and its nice to see it's still alive. There is nothing more that needs to be said this show has EVERYTHING!!! I can watch this show and I have watched this show 5 times through and through from the first episode to the very last one.<br/><br/>Humor romance drama real life moments the cast works so well together and I love this show everything about it!!! Just completed watching all episodes of friends.. And i am sad that it ended. It is so far the best comedy show I have ever watched. All characters have performed upto mark. Strong acting, excellent storytelling and outstanding direction has make the friends perfect... I am going to miss this masterpiece. Hats off to all the friends team. If you like comedy, you will like "Friends". As simple as that. Some peaple say it's overrated, but you shouldn't say about anything until you watch it by yourself. A heart warming comedy that will be a classic for years to come. A must watch for for comedy fans. Each episode is funnier than the last. I first heard of Friends about three years ago from my parents and then when I subscribed to Netflix I got an opportunity to watch the show and it blew me away! I have watched them over and over, episode after episode, season after season for over three times now and I plan on watching it the forth time. I guarantee that you will enjoy this as much as I did and I highly recommend it. Have fun! Best even season someone have ever watched and you want to see it again n again A timeless classic. Friends will forever be the GOAT Friends, Ohh what could I say, simply amazing. The best sitcom ever You laugh, you cry, you grow with them. It made me laugh so hard all the time. And the end is so so emotional..<br/><br/>This is just the best show ever made. 😍😍😍😍😍😍 Just amazing... Though all the actors in the show are amazing but i personally like joe and chandler, their comic timing is quite amazing. I wonder why i hv been 24 years late to see this amazing show... This series can be described as cure for depression :) I have never comment on any show before on imdb and i never watch comedy type shows but this one is MASTERPIECE. And i just regret that why i have not watched it earlier but it's good that I'm watching now and almost on last season( because it's a golden show). No other comedy show can beat FRIENDS. All actors are AWESOME !
And It's Must RECOMMENDED to watch from my side.
10/10 🖤 The only show that I completed it 4 times and still watch it again.<br/><br/>The only show that everytime I watch it, I still laugh like the first time.<br/><br/>The only show that I never wanted it to end. An amazingly funny and refreshing sitcom- never get bored of watching reruns! After finishing the series you fill that no show will ever be able to take place in your heart as friends does...<br/><br/>Part of heart fill empty inside after last scene and the instrumental after last scene can make anyone cry... In my opinion this show is the best show ever made ...
watching it will attach you with a special bond with the casts .....i had lots of fun watching it. those who are looking for reviews to start watching this show definitely go for it . its worth your time. If i could put stars more than 10 i will put as much i can. Friends show is best thing on TV. I love this show. All the characters are likeable and the storylines are great. The comedy is so funny too. Who could forget when Ross freaked out over his sandwich being eaten or Joey doesn't share food. Chandler's jokes are the best! And the catchphrases are hilarious. Plus Ross and Rachel's will they won't they is so intriguing. Plus Monica and Chandler are cute together too! Highly recommend this show. It'll leave you wanting more after each episode because of how hard it makes you laugh. 10 out of 10! Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends. 14 years have gone by since this show has ended. 14 years, And yet it's still one of the most popular shows today. It is one of the most watched shows on Netflix right now, and even younger generations are throwing out quotes from this beloved series. This is what makes the show so great. Even though it's been over for 14 years, you can enjoy it in the same way today as you could then. Everything about this show was on point from the humor and laughs, to the drama and heartbreak. There has never been a show that can flawlessly dictate how the audience is going to feel like friends did. If they wanted laughs for that episode, then the jokes were going to crack everybody up. And if they wanted tears, the drama was so good that everyone felt it. Also the acting is phenomenal! You see the actors names during the "I'll be there for you" opening sequence. But you say to yourself who the hell are those people. Because you don't know who David schwimmer, Matt le blanc, Matthew perry, Courtney Cox, Lisa kudrow, and Jennifer Aniston are while watching it. You only know Ross, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Raechel. Im 19 and grew up watching this show. And my kids will watch this show. And so will their kids. This show will live on for many generations because it's so easy to love. It doesn't seem like it will ever die One of my favorite tv shows. 
Couldn't been written any better, I just love watching every second.
Great cast, great acting..
The only bad thing about it is that it didn't last more! So were Rachel and Ross on a break?<br/><br/>FAVORITE SITCOM After over a decade it's still the number one American TV sitcom. The Funniest, great dialogue, great Acting, perfect characters No words than than: the best, simply, I don't expect anything better to come along in my lifetime, therefore, it's the best. I love it and it is so amazing (Season 10 episode 11) "The one where the stripper cries) is amazing It's perfect. It contains everything that you could possibly want in a show. You will love the characters, and will give you a few "falls-from-your-chair" laughs. It's hilarious. This sure put a smile in my face... :)
not to mention, almost a drop of tears at the end... :( Love the entire series... Very humorous and best entertainer... Each and every character in the series doing perfect work..... one of the best series till now... <br/><br/>i personally love Jenifer Aniston and David Schwimmer they both make best romantic comedy pair... I found the show absolutely amazing and worth watching. The plot is not complicated and thus can be followed with ease. It is a kind of stress-reliever. All the main characters and most of the secondary characters are worthy to mend into the plot. The writing, plot twists, performances, comedy content, romance content are on point. It mainly give you chills and a feel-good vibe about the simplest, yet important feelings and aspects of one's life. It is 100% agreeable to youngsters. It showcases the best written and portrayed on-screen couples of the television history when you analyse them to the very core. It provides the best guidance and suggestions to dating couples. It focuses on the most important things in a relationship and signifies the need to workout a relationship depending on how each individual feels about the other when one or both of them are not completely over each other whether it may be a breakup or spat. There are many signature one-liners which are in- sync with today's lifestyle. It solidifies the fact that no matter how much humans evolve, there will be a part of them which never changes and which becomes the hallmark of each one's personality. It surprisingly makes one feel that maybe being friends with someone is much better than moving forward to becoming lover or partner. It proves the thought that no matter how much a couple care for each other, it doesn't always has to work out in the way they want it to be. Sometimes being good friends with someone washes away the thought of getting intimate with each other so that if they try to work things out, it gets weirder and weirder. On the other hand, if someone is not in a good friend zone,they might have a great chance of ending up together eventually because no one else can be better for them individually. It indirectly lists out the insecurities of every individual being in a relationship. It also lists all those things needed to gain your partner's love, in which we, humans focus on very few. It justifies the point that the heart always wants it wants. Overall, it is a great show which can lift your spirits high, can make you laugh and cry at the same time, can make you smile with satisfaction and merriment, can dig your heart deep and can make you remember it for a lifetime. I request the people who are reading this review to make the show a must watch, and to note the fact that i have watched it 6 times and it never got old!!!. Goodbye :-) Love you to all the team of friends. You all just changed my life and changed my perspective of living. Not only you made us life but you also teach about the essential lessons of life.We wish you were still doing it but also you had enough we can understand.Love you all JOEY CHANDLER ROSS PHOEBE MONICA RACHEL. Friends is such a good show that I have watched the show a thousand times. Too the acting, plot, jokes, etc it was really good. The characters were amazing and well written, all the characters had different humorous traits are were amazing, all the actors did an amazing job. How can a show be so addicting? Right now after writing this review of Friends, I want to watch the show and guess what I will watch it. I am a gen z 2000s kid and have heard a lot about 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'. Never gave it a try because it looked the most 90s show ever, and yes it is.<br/><br/>Pandemic happened and everybody is worrying and panicking, so I said I will try to watch a sitcom to forget about all the sh!t around me. I watched friends as it had the highest ratings.<br/><br/>God was I addicted, 236 episodes in 65 days, people have done better than me but for me this is a lot. Even when I wasn't watching the show I was laughing while playing the clips in my head.<br/><br/>Many complain for the use of laugh-track but I see no problem with that, it is a scientific fact that if others laugh around you, you too break into laughter ( I am pretty sure this was the reason old sitcoms had those)<br/><br/>My most laugh-out-loud moments that I felt didn't reach high internet fame were
-Chandler and Joey with Ben, and Chandler says 'what kind of scary-a$s clown came to your party'
-Joey going to Rachel Boss and asking why he wanted to buy Rachel's daughter
-Janice showing up<br/><br/>
In all these scenes I fell from the place I was sitting in laughter<br/><br/>I have already made so many great memories with the show,
Janice showing up as she dates Ross, I screamed Ohh Myy Goooddd! in the most Janice way possible. My parents on the other room starts scream as to what happened to me.<br/><br/>I remember a time when I was having great agony and started watching an episode and just forgot everything I was going through.<br/><br/>It actually felt like having Friends in Real life. I knew everything, every secret, every little detail that another friend knows.<br/><br/>Loved every stereotypical roles they had, Joey getting dumber as seasons progress was a wise decision as Dumb Joey had more comedic moments that will stick with me forever. Early Jo felt a weaker version of Chandler's Sarcasm.
Phoebe being the different friend was fantastic as she brought something different, idk what but she's different and love these kind of characters<br/><br/>I relate to mostly
Chandler's comedy
Ross's geekness
Joey's idiotic remarks ( I still regret some of my idiotic moments)<br/><br/>
Definitely ganna rewatch the show in future and ganna watch it with more time so I live in the friends world for longer<br/><br/>One the best time passing shows I have ever seen.
All I know is that I will always have Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Dr.Drake Ramoray and Ragina Phalange to make to laugh. It's the best comedy show I've ever seen. It's like stress burster for me. I've seen every episode at least three times. Once when it aired, then when we borrowed the dvds, and now streaming. I think it's fantastic. It simply doesn't have a bad episode, sure there are stand outs but quality from first to last.<br/><br/>Great characters, great casting, brilliant writing, stand out supporting cast (keep your eye on Gunther, in the background in the episode where Joey keeps hitting Ross in Central Perk). Yeah, sometimes you can see the twist, or the plot ending a mile away but it's the journey to those punchlines.
Has it dated? A bit (certainly the fashions!) but for a show that had one of the first same sex weddings on tv, dealt with surrogacy, fidelity, sexual expression, female empowerment (the women frequently got the upper hand on the guys) and in which the male stars fought for their female colleagues to get equal pay you can't deny it was ahead of its time. Friends is a really good Tv show. It's great because it's relaxed and you can do other things while watching it. The series is good because it reflects a lot on real life issues and how some people might have it. All the friend characters are so great I just love them! Hilarious serie, love the characters. Getting a bit old though compared to modern shows: the audience laughs and staged humour and outdated clothes bother me. Best of the best
Joey is the best character
Hope that they will make a movie
Eurovision 2020 Undoubtedly greatest comedy show ever. Addicted like never before. Watched it and re-watched it tons of times! Never gets old and it's always funny. Love it! This is genuinely one of THE best shows I've seen, at first I was concerned that there was 10 seasons but when I started watching I needed more, sometimes I'd watch 2 seasons without knowing that I watched 2 seasons it's crazy funny and really really good, if you haven't watched it yet and your thinking of watching it, don't watch one episode then stop, watch at least 3 or 4 because the first few episodes are not that great but the rest is just wow, there's honestly not enough words to describe how great this show is. I dont know why rating of this show is 8.8.. it should be 10 i mean who can not like this show . You should watch it. World's best. Everything is perfect. Legend. Friends is one of my favorite tv shows. Why? Because it is too funny, lighthearted and pleasent. Could this show BE more awesome? I seriously recommend Friends. It will make your days happier everyday you watch. This TV show is the most amazing show of all times. For me it has to be on so I can go to sleep (background) The writing on this show is just perfect you can't get bored of watching this show and the ending is just perfect there was a few thing I wouldn't have wanted to happen other than that its a great show This is the best show I have ever watched. It's REAL funny unlike many other comedies and the plots are great. The cast is amazing. I have watched the whole thing 4 times and I have no regrets. It never gets old. No other series has ever touched my heart as friends have. Unforgettable. It's now 2019 and I have started watching it again. I Hate when I finished it I still miss him so much
I add him to my best series I ever watch I love so much friends.I hope this lovely show back:(.2019... I just finished season 10 and the only thing that i can say is to thank all the cast and producers for making all those great moments. it was one of the best things that ever happened in my life. thank u all u guys. I never watch a series like this, i completely fall in love with this series. It is show a great show that It Helped my friends get over depression. Best tv show ever , you live with the characters every sec Enjoy because it will never happen again , what a actors what a beautiful moments i never had This television series can be defined as a piece of life for all its viewers, its scenes are captures of timeless fragments that will remain forever engraved, brilliant acting performances and pure comedy. A lot of people, myself included, have reported that FRIENDS helped in their learning process of the English language. I truly recommend this series for the community of English learners. One of the best series (comedies) ever. Even after all this years we've never seen something like this Show or even close to it, The greatest sitcom ever to be broadcast on a T.V. Every episode of every season reflects creativity, perfection and comedy. How the group of six friends live and stumble in their life teaches us how to tackle our daily life problems. The screenplay was good, the acting, dialogues, jokes, sarcasm was good. There are so many beautiful memories that are made of gold. The places like the bar which turn into a coffee place where they used to hang out, the Monica's apartment, Joey and Chandler's apartment and many more. If you are looking for a good sitcom then you must give this a chance to satisfy your wants for entertainment. The story will never bore you, as it goes fast in time.
Loyal and sensitive Rachel, 'neat freak' Monica, sweet and crazy Phoebe, slightly dim Joey with all his macho-ness, witty Chandler and nerd paleontologist Ross are the six main characters. And I never wanted to see the last episode of FRIENDS 'the last one' because I didn't want it to end, but I watched it accidentally and got emotional, man!!! why am I writing this? And now I have nothing to watch. But I still watch it anyway. This television series is too good as well as game of thrones. 😊😊 This was an amazing journey that i went through with the characters and the laughing audience.<br/><br/>I feel like I was laughing right there with the audience.<br/><br/>My favourite character is Ross because he has the same name as me.<br/><br/>P.S. my teacher is pretending he is Darth Vader. LOL 🍑🍑🍑 The best series! I just finished the last season, and I think I will rewatch it soon! Tons of laugh, tons of smiled ! This movie is a real mood elevating even when you have hard times! Recommended 100% Should you even be looking up a review? :D
This show is my absolute favourite one which I watch every day.
A story of 6 friends who in their early 20s are trying to make it on the outskirts of New York City. All of these 6 friends have different personality traits and even so they are the thickest of friends. They have different family backgrounds and with their stash of insecurities they manage to live a life around it sometimes with the help of their friends. They can be vulnerable and open with each other which makes them family!! They grow over the years with experience and the show has moments where some characters think in retrospect feeling fulfilled but at the same time new challenges erupt and they draw hope from seeing how far they have come.<br/><br/>I have listened to some people claiming how friends is just a bunch of losers who sit over at the coffee shop and whine about life. But I disagree and say that it's much more than that. They do not always whine and complain. They support and cheer on each other. Help each other with their shortcoming and fears. They are genuinely happy when their friend is happy and sad when their friend is sad. One would be lucky to have one good friend in this age and time.<br/><br/>All in all it's a wonderful series and all the best when you reach the last episode in the past season. It's going to break your heart as you will have loved it very much. Best among all. Friends is a show that always tops the list when it comes to favourites. Even after almost 15 years one can watch it again and again feeling the same. Monica, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel, Ross are the characters that shows and teaches us something about life and friendship. Every character leaves a certain impact on it. If you haven't watched it yet, then you are missing something and you should watch it now. The show is worth watching and best among all. Friends has got to be the most cleverly written show to ever be on. No wonder it lasted 10 seasons. It's funny, very clever and each episode is original. This show is one of the best comedies I've ever seen and I'm usually not a fan of comedies Much like The office, I find myself going back to this show over and over again.
Never disappoints. OH MY GOD in Jennis tone, I can't believe the show ended a decade ago but still a masterpiece! I feel growing and living with them while watching this show.
I hope the series just on their break. Hooked to it now. Such a great show. The characters are so relatable. Similar to our life's... Fabulous work by all the characters ... just hats off I only started to watch friends because everyone said it would be cool. first I didn't understand the jokes but later on I started to understand them . The stories are very good and it's very addictive! Its also very funny once you are in the Friendsfever!!
Love it!! I don't really get enough of these episodes no matter how much i watch them.
It is really the best show I've ever seen.
And still, I'm watching friends whenever i have the chance. Enlightens you with it's humor.. you will be glad to watch it. :)
Cheers Friends are still running on my Netflix account every time I want to relax. It's now 15 years ago that they ended the show and it's still amazing. I'm not even old enough to remember when the show ended. Watch it all from beginning to end once, and you will feel like you really know the Friends. As the title say one of the best. If you have good or little sense humour then perfect show for you and must watch for the people who enjoy comedy.
Few episode are enough to make you addict to the show.
Pls do check some episode.
My fav is chandler:-) I love it . All the guys and girls are very funny and awesome . My favorite character is Joey . In fact, I wish I didn't finish watching the series. I hope there are more episodes of the series.
With my regards: Nawaf Alotibi I don't know which stupid guys are giving this guys 1 star. They obviously either don't have friends or they can't understand what it feels about. This show is all about emotions, humour, romance, drama. There's no other show I love more than FRIENDS. Some people have watched it completely, know about each and every character, knows what they do and then giving it one star. If you don't like the series, don't watch after 2-3 episodes. This show is legit the funniest show i've ever watched. i got no negative comments when it comes to Friends! love it so much <3 Awesome! Simple and sweet... Even after 14 yrs it just feels right for every mood, you're happy watch it., you're angry/sad anytime just watch it.... You should love this series and people consider this like a society contrast, yeah, it is somehow. I mean, they are always fun and they have done a lot of full episodes with different thematics. This is our go-to show. We watch one or two episodes every night to wind down for bed. We've been doing this for probably 10-15 years, and have watched the entire series countless times! It doesn't get old. I don't know why or how this is the case, but it is! Delightful contemporary show about youth living the dream in NYC. Great comedy to relieve one's daily stresses. Never to be duplicated. This show never gets boring and never lets me down with any of the episodes. This series just melts my heart every time. Those six persons are now like my family. Chandler's sarcasm, Joey' flirting, Phoebe's weirdness, Rachel's beauty, Monica's cleanliness and Ross's geekyness is just too lovely to handle. One of the best serie I have ever watched!! If you still didn't watch it, go and watch. This is the great comedy series that I have ever watched.this is very heart touching Perfect combination of jokes inside jokes and what we do in usually with friends I don't like situation comedies, but I adore Friends. When forced to watch situation comedies, I never laugh... When watching friends, I'm
Laughing constantly. I just love Friends. Lynne This is the best TV series ever. I have watched this thousand times, except for the last episode. I can't watch it as it ends. When I finish it I realized that no TV show will ever going to satisfy me Best show ever
best show ever
best show ever
Best show ever
best show ever
best show ever Why can't I give ratings more than 10. Why God why? Could this show be any better? No matter how many times you watch this show it is hilarious every single time. Bestest show ever. No show can ever substitute Friends. This show will remain one of the greatest creations of mankind. These guys love and laugh and care about each other like family! I mean who can forget Joeys stupid but sophisticated attitude or Chandlers sarcasm or Ross's awkwardness and so on...The only show better than Friends is Big Bang Theory. Actually I take that back...theyre both 10 out of 10 Watched more that 10 times, still feels new. A lot of thing you will see will match with you own life. Who hasn't seen Friends? The show is immensely popular all over the world. Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends. Even after 19 years i'm still watchin it and i'll never get bored.
When i become angry i'll go and watch some episode, When i'm sad i watch some episode, When i'm happy the same. This was the first English language programming series that I watched, most of the jokes I could never understand to or relate. Watching it again and again brings back memories. After all these years you have to appreciate the writing and the acting which makes this series the best of all time We can relate our life to the show in various occasions.Ross and Monica gives us some serious sibling goals..and chandler and joey are friendship goals...if everyone saw life in the way Phoebe saw, it would be a hell lot easier....mondler&roschel😍 😍simply love this show .. 24 years back this all started. Even after this long period it is and will be one of the best sitcoms. No one can forget these six people who actually became our F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Do watch this show atleast thrice in your life because once you begin u cannot stop Friends is my favorite sitcom of all shows. I love all of the 6 amazing characters in the friend group - Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, Chandler. And 10 years passed since the first episode came out. I felt actually hollow in heart when I watched them gathering in the empty apartment where they all ever lived for a while. It reminded me of laughter, tears and happiness through the whole 10 seasons which happened in both the apartment and a magical place called Central Perk. I really appreciated the spirits conveyed in the show - how to handle problems in terms of friendship, love, career, marriage.
It was a relief after watching the last season for 2 reasons. One thing is that Chandler and Monica actually reserved a room for Joey in their new house as Chandler has ever fantasied in Future. Another is Rachel gave up the career in Paris so I comforted myself wherever they are, these 6 people will always move on in their lives and get together for a cup of coffee somewhere in Manhattan, NYC. I had a lot of laughs, and friends is a amazing serie but for me serie got ruined by the ross/rachel relationship. I skipped so many episode because i was annoyed with rachel and ross getting back together and then break up and then back together I binge-watched this serie recently and I was so sad when it was over, that I started it all over again. I absolutely LOVE this serie. It's easy to watch and you can just sit back and relax. If you love drama and comedy, this is the perfect show! No matter how old it gets it's still the best show ever made! Best Thing i ever see to make me..must watch
............... With no doubt one of my favorite shows ever.
About to watch it for the 3 rd time. So relatable, so funny, so nice and comforting.
Amazing cast and characters with such nice personalities.
Watch it all and then watch it all over again. Friends is just so easy to enjoy, definitely the comedy of this era. Likeable characters, easy to understand stories, silly yet intelligent comedy. It'll be hard to top. Even Though i didn't live and wasn't born in the 90s, I still find this one of the best sitcoms ever. The characters are just great and the chemistry between them is just amazing; its so hard choosing who my favourite character is because they are all amazing!!! What i also like about this sitcom that it isn't always sexualized, most of the episodes are pretty much PG which makes it watchable for younger audiences or people who are not comfortable with watching sexual activities or references on a sitcom. Friends is life. Life without friends means nothing. 236 episode. It seems huge time loss, but when you started watching you will not regret your decision....
The TV series ever made in HISTORY...
Miss you 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'. Who hasn't seen Friends? The show is immensely popular all over the world. Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends. Binged watched this, I think almost every episode made me laugh, got the series I would recommend this series to anyone who likes comedy series.
Six friends living a common life, with their details, their dreams, and their thoughts, and the most beautiful are the moments of their frustration that is based on pure comedy.
24 years after the first episode, Friends still show cool. it's the best. This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends. Friends takes you back to the '90's qnd as you watch, you live vicariously through them: There are episodes for all moods, which makes it so relatable
 Central Perk was the meeting spot for Monica, Ross, Chandley, Pheobe and Rachel. Each character is different, but they all make the series worth watching. It is centralized on Rachel and Ross but always takes you thorugh relationshops the rest of the characters get into. The series is full of laughter, romancs, and drama. How can this be below a 10. You tripping my boys. I need everyone to vote 10 cuz this show needs to go up to over 9. Funniest comedy show in the world nothing can beat it I watched friends years ago when it came out and I've lost count of how many times I've seen it. It never gets old!! Ive just converted my partner who is now a friends lover! Every episode is full of non stop jokes. The characters are all quirky and hilarious in their own individual ways and each episode has a brilliant individual story but with a continuing underlying story line that cleverly navigates through 10 brilliant series. Would love to see a revival of this show! I watched friends for the 1st time back in 1995. Didn't found it that interesting but that was probably because I couldn't relate to the topics of each episodes. But along the way, I started to watch it more and more and almost 25 years later I still do. That's why I rated it a 10*.<br/><br/>The reason why it was one of the most succesful sitcom in its genre and is still being broadcasted in countries around the world is that everybody can relate to it one way or the other. <br/><br/>The topics of each episodes is all about life during your 20s and 30s. Boyfriends/girlfriends, career, family issues, money, bills, ups & downs, it is all being discussed in Friends. And whether you watched it 20 years ago or you just started to watch it, the topics will always be relevant no matter what. I never do reviews. Never. But I feel like I should review this awesome show!<br/><br/>I started watching it for the first time not a while ago, as I'm 14 I haven't watched it before. I must say it impressed me as I was expecting something different: even though it first aired over 20 years ago, it is still a really modern show.<br/><br/>If you love comedies this is for you! This is the best series I've ever seen in my life: great story, great actors, great romances, extremely funny & more! 'Friends' is one of my favorite shows that has aired. Even after its ten years of run time, I still have grown to enjoyed every moment of it. I first got introduce to this show through my older brother and when I first witnessed it, I thought, "What is so funny about that?" I was fairly young when I first watched the show, but as I grew older, I have seen more and more the episodes and I have just grown to understand the meaning behind some word or phrase that just got me crying from laughter. Till this day I re-watched many episodes and still laugh about it as if it were the first time viewing it. I do believe this show still has its memorable moments whether it be: Joeys favorite catch phrase, "How you doin'?", Monica's mother like personality, Ross's nerdy but likable side, Rachel's sensitive side , Phoebe's uncaring and crazy personality, and Chandler's 'cool kid' side. <br/><br/>I would recommend this to about anyone in need of a show to watch. I know that there are more favorable go-to shows before this, however, it is still worth watching. Never get sick of it 
Never got bored 
No words can describe the joy that this show brought to our lives 
Forever F.R.I.E.N.D.S Watching friends is one of the best I could do with my eyes.
Everyone should watch each and every episode before they die.
I have watched each episode, I can't even count how many times but i still don't get enough of it. This taught me how important the friends are in our daily life!
Life is all about enjoying the every moment and friends are the only way to hide or forget our problems!!
Just stop reading the reviews and start to watch it !!!
Watching this will be the bestest moments in your life Along with the Fresh Prince and Only Fools and Horses, this is one on the greatest comedies of all time. The chemistry between the 6 leads is fantastic. A few similarities with Fresh Prince, but a great show in all. For me Joey (Matt Le Blanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) were a brilliant duo and how their characters matured in there roles. The rest Rachel, Monica, Phobe and Ross just as funny and weird as Joey and Chandler. Just watched it again on netflix, where i appreciated it even more, without the TV edits. This show is so ahead of its time. It's iconic before the revolution of social media, yet remains relevant even though most episodes were filmed in the 90s. 
This show transcends generations and remains the best feel good show of all time. The greatest show of all times!!! Always funny, great story lines, great acting. There will never be another show good as this one!! Well what is there to say? It's a classic. Even though I lived through the original airing of this show I never really got around to watching it. Even so, I knew the show was huge - it was everywhere in the culture. I finally decided to watch through the series. It didn't disappoint. What I liked best about the show was the way they managed to weave in emotional high points contrasted with low points in the lives of the characters. That is something that seems to be missing in most of the sitcoms of today - never any true low points in the lives of the characters to connect with them and cheer them on when they achieve the high points. 
Clearly, it's a show worth watching! I can never get enough of it. It's so hilarious even if you're watching it for the 1st time or re-watching the 25th time or on repeat mode, the hundredth time. The spontaneity is gold. My love for every other TV show faded away and this one is an exception.
P.S: My '9' is the standard '10' and my '8' is the standard '9' This is probably the most evergreen comedy of all time. I love the fact that human mind forgets stuff. Thus I can watch it again and again. Great and funny...........................................................................................................................................())()$(4677(6&;;)); Probably the best sitcom I have watched so far . Each and every character has a special role to play in the story line. The chemistry between the cast is great . Most importantly I still find it funny 25 years after it has aired. While it is not so much informational. this is easily the best show for anyone in need of a good time and many laughs. Like an adult version of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, these two are my favourite and if they are not ours, you are not human. I don't go by a day without watching friends. I watched the whole 10 seasons for the 8th Times now and yes I can remember almost every line and I still love it. <br/><br/>Also. Thank you for hiring Matt & Lisa. I liked the show so much but what pissed me off is WHY PHEBE IS MARRED TO MIKE HE JUST APPEARS FEW TIMES IN THE LAST SEASON !!?? I SHIPPED JOEY AND PHEBE SINCE SEASON ONE BECAUSE THEY BOTH ARE IDIOTS AND FUNNY AND SAYING STUPID THINGS ?? but at least Ross and Rachel get back together and the show is really good worth watching it Friends is probably one of the most overrated television shows in history. I noted a recent IMDb poll about the most overrated TV show resulted in Friends nearing the top of the list. <br/><br/>It's mundane, dull and silly brand of humor is simply painful to watch. A bunch of 20 something year olds peddle out some stupid story lines and sometimes poorly attempt physical comedy. These imbeciles are unimpressive characters that make you cringe rather than laugh. A never ending list of superior shows can be listed that will surpass this show. Friends is a poor man's Seinfeld. Seinfeld is the greatest comedy in TV history, it is an insult to put Friends in the same sentence as Seinfeld. Seinfeld had sky high ratings and one of the most watched finales in history. Friends on the other hand is a rock bottom show which doesn't compare. <br/><br/>The only redeemable aspect of this show is its theme song which is quite good. Whenever I listen to it I pretend it is not associated with this atrocity of a show. Revisiting this show as an adult brings no laughter and good memories, but disappointment that I ever thought it was decent. What an overrated charade.<br/><br/>The writing is extremely inconsistent. Characters change traits and in/conveniently forget recent events in between episodes so often that you wonder if the writers had a goldfish memory span or something.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow can barely string a sentence without smirking out of character even in "serious" scenes. Her character is annoying to no extent, with an unrealistically high self-image and constantly being ungrateful to kind gestures, much like Monica and Rachel.<br/><br/>None of the female characters are likable and all of the male ones act like cucks, praising them, while getting constantly belittled by them.<br/><br/>The only decent actors are Matthew Perry and Schwimmer, who often make an otherwise unwatchable show somewhat decent with their performances, but unfortunately the rest of the cast is really low tier. Matt LeBlanc is actually not that bad, I've seen him in Married with Children, sometimes he's even great, but I can't say a single good thing about the rest of them.<br/><br/>The woman who plays Rachel can barely act, she's been doing the same cringe-worthy smirks and lines for 40 years and was clearly going trough life thanks to the cuckery of the men around her who gave her the acting job and handed her everything without her having to develop a single talent or earn anything herself, clearly. If she wasn't mildly attractive by 90's standards she wouldn't get anywhere. And that's all, all she used was her looks, thinking it's enough.<br/><br/>The woman who plays Monica occasionally does a good performance but gets extremely bland and lazy in the later seasons.<br/><br/>Even Gunther, who barely had any lines gave more of a memorable performance.<br/><br/>Microphones, equipment and studio lights are often visible. The same annoying laugh tracks repeat trough all the seasons. <br/><br/>When I was 8 and I first saw the show I thought it was funny but as an adult with a fully developed brain - I can now realize how bland, misandric and lazy it really is; grossly overrated.<br/><br/>Each episode glorifies the girls and belittles/emasculates the guys in some ridiculous way, plot developments where Ross was nice to Rachel are conveniently forgotten so he can be portrayed badly, while she's walking all over him and it's never acknowledged as a bad thing, but constantly repeated as "funny". The hateful, feminist undertones were a new thing for a show in the 90's so good job on that one, might be one of the first misandric shows to start this trend, then continued in other terrible shows such as Two and Half Men.<br/><br/>Overall if your IQ or age is under 10 - you might (have) enjoy(ed) this show, otherwise you might have problems if you still think it's good even trough nostalgia glasses. This show lasted 10 years? I didn't actually watch it until it was in reruns. And even then, it took me a few times to get past the opening theme song without vomiting, which is a flat out rip off of Black Sabbath's "After Forever". Surprised there wasn't a law suit over it.<br/><br/>First I'll start with the one positive and the only positive I can find, is that Jennifer Aniston is good looking and has nice hair. Other than that, there's nothing else positive I can say about this show.<br/><br/>The three main male characters are carbon copies of each other. It's often difficult to distinguish them from each other except for how they comb their hair. There's the guy who combs his hair forward, the guy who's exactly the same but combs his hair side ways and the other guy who combs his hair sideways with oil and spikes it a little.<br/><br/>This show is not only painfully boring, it's completely annoying. From the opening theme to the duplicate male characters and the poorly written scripts, it's a steaming pile of garbage. The fact it lasted for 10 years is a testament to the American public's poor taste and stupidity. I have newly gone through friends,it took me 3 months.for three months, i have been thinking maybe there are people like them are living at some corner of this world.they are not rich,not famous,not that smart,but they are happy,happy together.ten years, what a long time,i have never thought i can have friends for 10 years.amazing,is not it?for three months, i have been thinking i was just at some corner of their house,watching them, laughing with them, tearing with.when i finished the whole thing, i laid on my bed and could not sleep. just cannot believe they are gone, and will never be back.cannot forget Rachel's cry and Chandler's joke(though sometimes i didn't get them) Well, the spoilt actors in Friends receive around 1 million dollars pr episode, and that just about does it for me. Besides, they are not very good actors, and the storyline repeats itself every other episode.<br/><br/>What a waste of time. In stead you should turn off the TV and go visit someone who are lonely or help your old neighbor with something. I don't know what it is I just don't find this show funny. It's so annoyingly boring. Funny are shows like: Father Ted, Coupling, Brilliant,The Young Ones, Absolutely Fabulous, Married With Children, The Simpsons, MAD T.V. both versions of Men Behaving Badly(British & American)& Family Guy. Now that's funny,my friends like "Friends", but I just don't get the show. I don't like it,I don't understand what the big fuss is over this show. The one person who is even close to funny on that show is Jennifer Aniston when she was on "The Edge". The sooner this show ends the better, that & "Will & Grace" another boring show! Repetitive "jokes", stale characters, toxic fans. Unbelievably overhyped trash. Pathetic and annoying. Can't find the hype. hardly makes you laugh. Jokes are not even clever. Cannot believe this scores so highly on ImDb. The attempts at humour aren't even funny. Very bland show. It's a timeless television series that will be memorable for a long time. It's not just the catchphrases, it's not just the well-known actors/actresses that lead this fun sitcom but there's characters to relate to, there's jokes to be heard and ultimately there is friendship which we all crave and need.<br/><br/>The show revolves about Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) trying to be with the woman he's loved since the ninth grade -- Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) are great for their one-liners and providing the 'friends' vibe throughout the entire run. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) will provide you with some random comedy, throwing you off track almost every time she utters something. Monica (Courteney Cox), Ross' sister, is an obsessive controlling neat freak who glues all six of them together.<br/><br/>As time grows on, the friendships between the six strengthen and the comedy increases. For a total of ten years, you'll learn and become friends with fictional people and hope that someday, somewhere, these people exist.<br/><br/>Fans of Friends, like me, will most likely talk on the message boards, know the detailed trivia of each of the characters and sometimes live in their own world with their "Friends".<br/><br/>It's not a show for children, as some of the jokes in the later seasons because sexual and/or adult themed. However, I grew up watching Friends, from the age of barely six till sixteen. I wasn't a normal kid. When my friends were watching Barney, I was watching Seinfeld or Friends.<br/><br/>I love Friends and I think it's one of the best sitcoms of all-time. It incorporates so many elements that we all possess in some way. Each character has something and is missing something that the other characters help with. Ross is quirky, but he's shy, but Rachel helps with that. Joey is a womanizer, but lacks intelligence but is helped thanks to Ross. Every person who has watched Friends can walk away telling their own friends which character they are most similar to.<br/><br/>It's filled with episodes that will make you laugh, warm your heart and some that will make you cry -- happy and sad -- tears. There's nothing to hate about Friends. A great treat for viewers is the long list of elegant A-list cameos/guest stars over the ten years that the series ran for. I thank Marta Kaufman and David Crane for their efforts and creative vision to create such a wonderful show. I loved this show in fact I have every season and all summer long that was all I did was watch Friends. I am 13. Obviously this show is the best show I ever watched, or I wouldn't have watched it enough to see a picture of the show and I could tell you which season it is from. This show came out around the time that I was born so it's kind of weird that I would love it so much. I would choose to watch this over any other show that most teenagers watch. Sometime I even watch it on the computer while Im online and I end up paying more attention to Friends than to the rest of the screen. The ending just depressed me a little bit... I wish that they could have a spin-off with Monica and Chandler like they did with Joey, or one with Ross and Rachael... Or even if in the show Joey he went to see the others. I always go back to season one after I watch season 10. One time I couldn't stop laughing when I watched it, that was about 4-6 years ago when I started watching it. I'm going to watch it when Im done typing this, and I hope that by reading this someone else wants to watch it too. I just can't put my finger on what makes this show so popular.  I don't hate it, and I am not a big fan of it either.  I just seem to be sitting on the fence with this one.  I haven't been able to sit through a whole episode of this show.  For me, it's one of those shows you stop at for a few minutes while channel surfing, then turn it off hoping you will be able find something better on the tube.  For this type of situation comedy, I always thought "Living Single" was a lot more entertaining.  The characters on that show were likable and seemed more real.  On "Friends" I find everyone is vying for the comedy spotlight & none of them want to be the "straight guy" that the comedy is directed towards.  Some episodes are amusing, but on the whole, I would not miss this show if it went off the air, nor about 99% of the trash thats on network TV nowadays. Or, take the cartoon characters from "Scooby Do", dumb them down by loosing the dog and add "giggle sex". Teenagers of all ages have yet another swarmy-cutesy TV series which bolsters their self worth (so they think).<br/><br/>This series makes sense only when you remember the overarching vanity of the desperately self obsessed young.Otherwise, it's not even bad enough to be embarrassing or sardonic. Think of: Cheap white bread and week old skim milk.Yawn. I have to tell you, Internet Movie Database, the Earth's largest movie database, that FRIENDS got me through some really rough times. I won't go in to that. That may be one of the reasons I love it, but I really think it is because FRIENDS is the best show every on TV..in my opinion.<br/><br/>Chandler: This is the guy that "jokes" are his defensive mechanism. And man, are they funny. I love every thing Chandler says. He is the main attraction for this show, which is funny cause the producers have been quoted to say they intended for him and Phoebe to be "supporting characters".<br/><br/>Phoebe: Speaking of Phoebe, Lisa Kudrow is a comedic genius and deserves every single award she has won. You can't stop laughing at her. You go through moments in the show (almost every episode)where after she says something, you emotions are as follows: "WHAT?" and then "Oh my word, that is so funny." Ross: I rank Ross the highest on my list, because he is the best actor of the bunch. When the show was first airing on TV, it was hard to catch, because he was just that good. Everything he did, especially the physical stuff was just hilarious. People tend to think Chandler or Phoebe are the funniest, but Ross....he is the ACTOR. He has the most training of the group.<br/><br/>Rachel: Rachel is on the show cause she is gorgeous, hip and adorable, but I don't think it was for her comedic skills. Sure, she is funny some, but when you watch the show over and over like I do....Rachel's jokes are not funny for the second time...and definitely not the 2000th. Chander's, Phoebe's, Joey's and Ross' always are. Rachel also grows up on FRIENDS, so it is a coming of age story for her. It is interesting to watch her grow.<br/><br/>Monica: Oh Monica. I would say Monica is the most complex actor on the show. She has a lot of trails as the series progresses, and many are mirrored after her personal life, which just makes it more real. I would say she has to be the most "generic" on the show, after Rachel. Till about Season 5, she is the straight man. But after Season 5, she really becomes HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>Joey: I have saved Joey for last because he is also a fave of mine. He is just so dumb. Really. Like it makes me laugh so hard when Phoebe and Joey try to talk to each other. They are both just dumb, and that is their attraction. Many find Joey very good looking, and I do not. My attraction is just how dumb and what a slut he is.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best show of all time for me. You can't ever top it. It revolutionized sex and made 30 the new 18. Everyone could relate to this show, and syndication has only made people love it more. But it really is much more than that. It is the funniest show. THE funniest. I love it! Basically, if you haven't seen FRIENDS, you really need to! If you are a male and you are in doubt of your sexual preference, I have a sure-fire way to determine your life style. It's really simple. Look through your DVD collection, and if you find a copy of "Friends: Season One"............I think you know where this is going. This show is obviously directed toward an audience of 17-19 year old girls who spent most of their time in school passing notes about Johny's dimples. Don't believe me?, just listen to the dialogue, look at the cast, and view the plots and scenery. I am proud to say that none of my friends' personalities resemble any of the characters in this show. To any guys that had the misfortune of watching this show (forcibly by your girlfriends I hope), I sympathize for you. And if she went as far as buying you the box set, return the favor with a Hooters calender on her birthday. I tuned into this stupid and lame show a few times. One time they went to a party and a guy was talking a whole load of crap. Another time one of the characters became famous and she got worried. Then in the end this man comes in and says where's my turkey? Another Ross's ex wife Carol told him that she was pregnant. Another time Chandler got readdicted to cigarettes. And on another episode Joey's girlfriend wanted to sleep with him but he was too busy with studying.<br/><br/>Four Stars A very very interesting series .. Hero lover all .. During one day I watched 15 episodes of the series Thank you I watch every single episode thousand times & still laughing out loud. I love them all. The series just perfect. From the beginning till the last episode. I will never move on from this series. Ever. I didn't knew anything about friends,just heard that it's the very funny a lot of times from different peoples so last year i bought the DVD of season one and watched it.I have to say that i liked it than i got other seasons and was hooked to it there were times when i had tears in my eyes and stomach aches because of excessive laughter.<br/><br/>I became more curious after every season,i said that if this season was this good than how will the other one be so i bought all the dvds of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. when i was watching season 8 i felt very hard to watch the next episode because of the fear that it will end soon,i didn't wanted it to end ever but i couldn't resist not watching it for too long so after a month i played season 9 and followed by the last season.even though in the end it's not that funny like the earlier seasons but i enjoyed it the same.Today when i was playing the last episode "THE LAST ONE" i nearly had tears in my eyes because it was about to end and i never thought that a funny sitcom would make me cry it is very hard to tell what i feel,i hope that someday they would make season 11 even if they are 60 years old i will love it.<br/><br/>i don't know the reason why they stopped at season 10 when they got everything from it (money,fame,fans,success,etc) please make another part of it a movie or anything because i can't get enough of it ever.i have been watching every movie that the 6 Friends (joey,phoebe,rachel,chandler,ross,monica) have acted in but i miss F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Thank you :-the cast and crew of F.R.I.E.N.D.S for giving me the happiest year of my life. THERE IS NOTHING BETTER F.R.I.E.N.D.S.<br/><br/>AND AS THEY SAY You can never have enough Friends! The first few years of this show I blatantly ignored. Then 2 of my friends made me watch it in syndication and I found it pretty funny and entertaining. Sometimes the characters quirks get a little annoying (Chandler, Rachel) but Friends is usually an entertaining ensemble sitcom. Not nearly as funny or memorable as Seinfeld but those comparisons are silly to make. Hmm.. Friends... Oh, that show is still on?<br/><br/>Okay I have to admit.  It started out with a bang.  After year 2, it went bust.  Now it's just blah.  Completely overrated.  Sure it's only TV, and it's supposed to be funny.  But now it's just plain stupid.  So if you (claim to) like the talent of Friends that much and you're free on a Thursday night, do me a favor.  Put it on "Whose Line is it Anyway?" instead and then talk about comedic talent. The worst ever made, how people seem to think it's funny I will never understand. A group of privileged white people sit around some coffee shop doing absolutely nothing funny or entertaining. By far the most over rated piece of nineties trash television that for some reason people think is some how still relevant. Friends was simply one of the most overrated comedy show. What do you get when you mix three silly looking guys, with three women, and an annoying catch phrase (How you doin?). Answer- "Friends." It amazes me that a group of moderately talented people provided the formula for one of the longest running sitcoms in modern TV history. Before you get mad that I've called them moderately talented, take a look at how the projects that they've starred in outside of "Friends" have panned out. With the exception of The Whole Nine Yards, not well. Still, this show managed to pass itself off to millions of viewers as funny and hip and reached icon status. What a farce! Unfortunately, it will continue to haunt me for years in syndication. I would ask how anyone could like this show but seeing all the other rubbish on the alleged "Must See TV" leaves me not surprised at all.<br/><br/>Friends is a show that is full of hateful, selfish and unlikable characters who have no redeeming value of any sort.  The kind of people you would dislike if you met them.<br/><br/>Ross - is socially inept and unable to maintain any sort of meaningful relationship.  He alienates himself from people through his senseless actions perpetrated with little or no planning and can't figure out why there are consequences.<br/><br/>Chandler - is chronically unemployed and spends his days in a coffeehouse when he should be out trying to get a job he won't be able to hold for more than a few episodes.<br/><br/>Joey - possessing a lack of intelligence so astounding that it is a wonder and a mystery he made it to adulthood.  The only answer can be seat belts and helmets.<br/><br/>Phoebe - is an airhead who thinks that sexual overtures are the answer to all of life's problems.<br/><br/>Rachel - is highly co-dependent and cannot function in any meaningful way without someone in her life to latch on to.<br/><br/>Monica - is hateful and spends the entire show plotting the downfall of other innocent people around her.  She believes that the entirety of the universe functions around what she wants and she exhibits advanced signs of autism with her ability to shut out the world in exchange for focus solely on herself.<br/><br/>Now to the review of every episode of Friends. <br/><br/>1. Someone spends the whole show being mad at someone else for some insignificant affront. Because the cast believes that their way is the only way upon which the whole universe should operate they will spend the duration of the show spewing forth insipid volleys of hatred and disdain till someone else says "don't go there girlfriend" and the person in error sees that their ways are not right. <br/><br/>2. Someone spends the whole show being gotten mad at. Because the cast believes that their way is the only way upon which the whole universe should operate they will spend the duration of the show spewing forth insipid volleys of hatred and disdain till someone else says "don't go there girlfriend" and the person in error sees that their ways are not right.<br/><br/>
3. Someone will spend the whole show unemployed. <br/><br/>4. At least two of the people will spend the show trying to score. Among available people to score with - each other and Tom Selleck.<br/><br/>
5. All six members of the cast will spend the show whining about every single, solitary, distinct, individual, unalloyed thing to occur no matter how small, no matter how little impact on their lives. Because the cast believes that their way is the only way upon which the whole universe should operate they will spend the duration of the show spewing forth insipid volleys of hatred and disdain till someone else says "don't go there girlfriend" and the person in error sees that their ways are not right.<br/><br/>
A total waste of time and effort. After ten years on the air, I still don't see what the big deal is about this show.  When it first started, it was about a bunch of whining twentysomethings living in Manhattan.  Ten years later the main characters are a bunch of thirtysomethings and they are still whining.  At least this show will be over soon and we won't have to see any new episodes of this show anymore.  This definitely is the most overrated sitcom of all time. This show is made worse by the hundreds of over crap American sitcoms trying to imitate it. It is also made worse by the irritating laughing track, actors who try to be funny and boring jokes. The funniest character is pheobe, and chandler has his moments( so does monica, very rarely) but ross is irritating, rachael is let down by a terrible actress, and joey plods along with a few catchphrases. Sadly the characters arent forgettable( Oh i wish they were) And it is constantly shown on about 5 channels. Time for something new America. I say this knowing friends is the funniest thing america has ever produced (apart from britney and crossroads) so we arent going to get better than this from USA. Just stop making comedy America. I'm from Britain where the heart of comedy lies. Britain always has been the place where comedy is the best. I don't mean to bash American comedy but you guys really are no good at it. The jokes in friends are childish as are the storylines which are repeated over and over again every series. Why do the writers of friends have to milk it to death and make 28 million episodes a series for? The other thing is you people have no imaginations. Every sitcom you ever write is set in a flat involving dull flatmates who don't seem to get out much. Do what we do across the atlantic and write in different situations. The personalities of the characters in friends are just non-existent. these people just are not funny. They are idiots just running around making stupid noises shouting "Oh my god" at everything. Now many of you will jump on me instantly for coming on here to bash u.s sitcoms but you know once this show has died and finished (hopefully very soon) then the u.s comedy industy will collapse around itself and will cease to exist. Thats why U.S TV companies are holding onto friends for so long because they know this to be true. I mean come on, they don't seriously think that Will and grace or fraiser is gonna keep america in the world of comedy. Friends is just unfunny and is massively over-rated just like most U.S sitcoms.<br/><br/>Sorry to upset anyone but thats my view. This show should just stop. Move onto something new. A female friend once asked my why I never watched FRIENDS. After all, I was "twenty something" when it came out, so she naturally assumed I would identify with the characters. I gave it a chance. I tried. My biggest problem with the show was it's TOTAL preoccupation with sex and the kind of shallow materialism that plagued so many other "comedies" of the same era. I then asked my female friend why she was such a HUGE fan of FRIENDS and her answer summed up it's vapid appeal PERFECTLY. Every week the show transported her to a world where the people were MORE attractive, MORE successful, and MORE humorous then her own friends, and she truly believed it was a kind of blueprint for life. The show was safe and cute, and nobody ever ACTUALLY got offended. How pleasant. How noble. How bland. How forgettable...How SERIOUSLY delusional. Watch FELICITY reruns instead. It's FUNNIER and more REALISTIC. No stars. Jokes you've seen a million times before. Unoriginal and not funny at all. Very basic. If you're bored outta your mind, don't even watch this and go do your loundry or something. The most bad tv show I ever saw it's not funny and very bad acting Considering that I was allowed to watch the show growing up, and have really only watched episodes sporadically, I decided to watch the entire series in order. It was really great. Not surprised it lasted as long as it did. The chemistry of the entire cast was something a lot of shows lack, and their ability to ease into any scene or joke was admirable. My absolute favorite actor was Matthew Perry--Chandler Bing being my favorite character as well; He was relatable with his wit, charm, and all-around cluelessness. He almost made everyone else great. <br/><br/>In all reality, it's a really great show. I just CANNOT get over Matt LeBlanc's character Joey. They over-exaggerated his stupidity, even as a comedic relief. I realize this is a comedy show, but it was highly irritating... Even Courtney Cox's character Monica was a little neurotic sometimes, but considering she plays a character like that on her most recent show (can't remember the name of it), it's a little more understandable that she may only know how to play one character. Both characters were made more tolerable with Chandler by their side.<br/><br/>Overall, recommend it to anyone looking for a good honest laugh. Even my favorite show of all time, "Seinfeld," started to wane out in the final seasons.  I think "Friends" has reached that point.  It's almost time to call it quits.  I think the show should go about two more seasons, but that's it.  Now, the writers are simply going for cheap techniques to lure in audiences.  Can they even call the show "Friends" anymore?  They're all screwing each other!  I never had any friends like these!  So let me see, what's the update...Rachel is having Ross's baby, Joey confessed his love for Rachel, Chandler got married to Monica and Ross got married to practically everyone on the show.  This is a sitcom, but the writers are treating like it's "Dynasty" or "Dallas."  I think all of them should break up and they should just be FRIENDS again.  After all, that's the name of the show.  <br/><br/>But to be on the positive side, the show hasn't lost all touch.  I still think the show is very funny.  The cast still has the energy and chemistry they had when they first started.  Chandler has gained back his sarcasm--which is great, because I was getting worried for a while.  I still wish Chandler didn't get married to Monica, because he was so much funnier when he was slacking off with Joey, kicking back on the La-Z Boy, drinking beer and watching free porn.  His trademark sarcasm was in full swing back then.  Then after he became romantically involved with Monica, he became her lapdog and the sarcasm was lost.  But recently, his sarcasm has been coming back, which makes me feel proud.  Everyone has that sarcastic buddy who constantly makes smart-aleck comments.  We all know Chandler.  I know Chandler.  I am Chandler.  I can totally relate to his character; I'm always spewing the sarcastic remarks at exactly the right times.  As for Joey...Joey's still Joey and he will always be Joey.  I don't always embrace airhead characters on sitcoms--most of the times the writers make those characters stupid-stupid and not stupid-funny--but him and Phoebe are both a hoot and a half.  As dim-witted as Joey is, his gags are often witty.  I love that line where he says to Ross, "If homosapiens were in fact HOMOsapiens...is that why they were extinct?"  Ross replies, "Homosapiens are humans."  Joey says, "Hey I'm not judging."  David Schwimmer is funny, and sometimes hilarious, as the well-to-do but mildly stuck-up Ross Gellar. As dry as Ross's sense of humor is, he usually cracks me up, even if I'm laughing AT him.  Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox top off this great cast, which also includes some memorable recurring actors, like Christina Pickles and Elliott Gould as Ross and Monica's parents.  I haven't watched too many of the recent episodes, so I didn't get to check out all the guest appearances on the show, but I did see the episode with Bruce Willis and he was hilarious.  <br/><br/>I still like and will support this show for a few more seasons, but Ii still say if you want to see some memorable episodes of "Friends," watch the first couple of seasons on the repeats.  I, personally, have seen those episodes thousands of times, so I don't even want to watch a minute of the repeats, but if you haven't seen the show before--do check out the old episodes before the new ones.  <br/><br/>My score:  THE OLD EPISODES:  8 (out of 10) THE NEW EPISODES:  7 (out of 10) It is just painful to watch... maybe if you have lived on another planet for the last 100 years and had no access to sitcoms you could find this funny... there are hundreds of better ones... This sitcom is terrible. There were a lot of comedies much much better than this. To name a few the office, how I met your mother.... and I am not saying they don't have their downsides either. But this one would passed as a horrible headache and cancelled if it was made in recent times. The jokes and the situations the plot is based on are immature / childish and unrealistic respectively. And esp the characters like Phoebe would have passed as mentally disabled in real life. This sitcom is terrible. There were a lot of comedies much much better than this.

And esp the characters like Phoebe would have passed as mentally disabled in real life. I never really followed this show but I've watched episodes off and on, and though it's pretty funny in the first few seasons, it just gets stupid and extremely shallow as it goes on.<br/><br/>The fat jokes are unbearable as are the jokes about not fitting in and not being popular. Monica is annoying and extremely high maintenance, which is fun in a quirky way and up to a point, but suddenly the show becomes all about her and it makes no sense. Rachel is the only female character that's relatable and likable most of the time, so why all the focus on the most annoying character in the whole show? Fun enough, sure, but shallow and somewhat empty in a weird way. I used to love this show when I was a kid, and I would watch every episode religiously and discuss it the next day with me mates in school, I even asked for a box set for Christmas so I could watch my fave episodes more. Then I never really botherd after the Ross and Emily wedding. After that it just got boring and seemed to drag on and on.<br/><br/>For about a year after that wedding all it seemed to be was Monica and Chandler trying to hide that they were together, and after that Rachel and Ross deciding if they loved each other. Even now it has ended, it's still shown all the time on e4 and my mum puts it on, so I've seen every episode hundreds of times.<br/><br/>I really think that this show was dragged on for far too long. It should've ended a couple of series before it did. Most overreated tv show and over over overated and it is a over rated show so yes It's not the worst thing on TV, but nowhere near the best. For everyone who says it's horrible, lighten up. If you watched it more frequently you'd find something you like, and besides there's been much, much worse. As for being the "best sitcom on TV," I'd have to disagree. There's only one really great sitcom- Seinfeld- and everyone who's seen an episode knows it. I'd rather watch a rerun of Seinfeld than a new episode of Friends any day (if they were still making new episodes, of course). However, I'd also rather watch a rerun of Friends over any episode of According to Jim or Yes, Dear. And for everyone who says Jerry was bad in Seinfeld because he almost cracked up in many episodes, that's because the episode was so funny nobody on the set could keep a straight face. Actually, when I see him almost laugh it makes me crack up because I know the joke really IS that funny. Back to the subject at hand, if you want mediocre, go with Friends. It's not that horrible. IMDb has a very big trouble. It's ratings aren't well distributed and Friends is a great example. Talking of plain comedy, originality and fun, it shouldn't get more than a 4, maybe a 5. But ultimately, it gets 9 because IMDb's rating system isn't serious. So here I am, giving it a 1 when I think it deserves a 4. I feel like a monster! There are some good episodes, yes, like "The One Where No One's Ready", it shouldn't get a 1. But when you see the cheesy finale (okay, it's the finale, people like cheesy) getting almost a 10, or "The One With Unagi" as high as it is... you just can't be fair.<br/><br/>The real problem with Friends is that it's way too pushed. It tries to make things that are not relatable to general people relatable. It's not like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David's famous work, who were stand-up comedians on observation, people behavior. It feels even wrong to compare Seinfeld to this. Friends is like a bad, fan-made Seinfeld spin-off (much like "Modern Seinfeld"). In fact, the theatre fan- made Seinfeld episode is okay, so it's at least as good as Friends on its highs. On the same line, the best Friends episodes are the original ones to which the average person can relate.<br/><br/>This definitely will sound like a fanboy-ish review to most people, but it's the plain truth. You may even like it, but don't say it's good: there is good comedy and bad comedy, it's objective. Taste, on the other hand, is subjective. Each one of us have different taste and preferences but if one cleaves on the point that Friends is not a great show I think one needs to find musing time to discern that they are wrong.<br/><br/>The first season is slow and is just like a foundation stone to make the building strong and I take it when some people find it little slow or average,but The show outstrip all the loopholes from the season 2.<br/><br/>The show is fabulous,stupendous and I bet you will be in light and different mood in those 20-22 minutes and there will be rampant flow of smile and laughs for those 22 minutes.<br/><br/>This is the only show whose episodes I can watch infinite times and each time I will last laughing loud holding my stomach.<br/><br/>All the six actors have played their characters ingeniously and cannot be replaced or replayed equally well by anyone else ever. The show starts with "Monica" being teased by her friends Chandler and Joey in the central perk coffee shop and along with the cup of coffee the show starts brimming your life with fun,excitement,happiness and emotions.<br/><br/>All characters are different and best in their own ways.<br/><br/>Monica as motherly character being piqued for even a small changes made at her house by anyone except her and always eager to cook and thus rightfully the chef by profession.<br/><br/>Ross brother of Monica and affable goof with profession in paleontology.For Ross or "Doctor Ross" the love for dinosaurs is entail and marriages(including one while he was drunk) are inevitable with the record of three divorces thanks to her first lesbian wife,second inscrutable wife and drink for the third divorce. David Schwimmer was considered for this character even before the part for Ross was written.<br/><br/>Rachel Green portrayed by Jennifer Aniston a naive runaway bride who met her school friend Monica in coffee shop and thus awakens the love of Ross again after so many years.The character is naive,confused and even stupid in nature but evolves independent and bold.<br/><br/>Chandler the character played by Matthew Perry has become pinnacle alternative for sarcasm.Chandler,the Ross college room mate to Monica's spouse is well known for his punches and lively character.<br/><br/>Joey is the struggling actor and was the room mate of Chandler.Joey has a charisma or art to endorse girls towards him whether its because of his innocence or famous tag line "How you do-in" but no love is more to him than love for food.Joey is the favorite character of mine especially because of his innocent and carefree behavior,his love for acting is appreciable so is his play,practice of hosting TV show and practicing French :-p<br/><br/>Phoebe the egregious,satirical,bold and confident character who has spent her childhood without parents on road among criminals thus became so strong and bold.This character does not worry about the world and its adjudication.Phoebe with her guitar and carefree nature has many self-written and self-composed songs,whether one likes her singing or not but becomes attractive towards "Smelly Cat" and Yes!! you can not play with this song when Phoebe is around.The character of Phoebe is also known for her recrimination however stupid it would.Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan is played by Lisa Kudrow.<br/><br/>The sitcom is incomparable with any show,and will make you ludicrous while watching the episode for 22 minutes.Those 22 minutes are the best time of the day.I still rejoice Friends episodes whenever I get time to watch it. This is the most boring show of all time. That may be a complete overstatement, but so are all the positive comments of this less-than-below average "comedy." I could rarely make it past the annoying theme song without contemplating suicide when I realized I was actually going to waste time watching this drivel. This was a t.v. show written for shut-ins who need friends. I heard that it was popular, and spawned "water-cooler" conversation. But I have never heard anyone talk about this lame show. This show had exactly zero personality. Or, really, a personality built up from all the hype this uninteresting, trite little boring comedy evoked. If I was the only person who found the humor rather stilted and lazy, I have no hope for the future of American TV. And I am sure that I am the only person who found most of the characters (especially David Schwimmer) to be socially unattractive, plastic dorks. Although it seemed that each character slept with everyone on the show (90210?), the only positive thing I have to say about this show is that it is safe for children to watch without all the sexist, homophobic, lowest-common-denominator nonsense of other "hit" "comedies. I give this dud a 2 out of 10. It started out great. It really did. It's difficult for me to remember what I liked about the show when it first started 10 years ago, but I remember liking it a lot. In my most private moments I even dared compare it to "Seinfeld" and perhaps some of Friend's best episodes merit such a comparison. I seem to remember genuine comedy, an ability and willingness to make fun of itself, a show where it was all about laughs. (and the occasional unrequited love affair)<br/><br/>The show was something new. In contrast to Step by Step, Full House and the like, the writers of Friends didn't swing their proverbial baseball bat at the end of each episode desperately trying to convey some sort of moral "lesson" to be learned. We didn't have to mute our television sets for 90 seconds at the end of each episode to avoid the insulting tripe of a wagging finger and the subsequent "I've learned my lesson, and I've really grown as a person"-smack over the head. We could actually enjoy a show with clever jokes, witty repartee and amusing characters interacting with each other in comical situation. The show was funny, and with the exception of the Ross-Rachel-thing, there wasn't a whole lot of unneeded drama to pull at the viewer's heart strings.<br/><br/>Then came the infamous trip to England. Ross leaving Emily at the altar was *not* the climax of the trip for me. Seeing Chandler in bed with Monica shocked me, not because of the simple fact that they had 'had of the sex', but because I was afraid of what would follow. (And unfortunately, it did.)<br/><br/>The funniest character on the show, Chandler Bing - the sarcasm king, the pinnacle of pathetic, the most adorable loser on television died that night with Monica in his arms. Slowly, but steadily, the show became worse and worse from that moment on. In addition to killing off the funniest man on the show by having him be Monica's lapdog, the trip to England also heralds a new era of the show. It wasn't all done at once. The show was still funny after the trip to England, but not as much as it had before; additionally, it got worse by each episode.<br/><br/>Little by little, these "I love you/I love you too"-scenes kept creeping in, forcing the audience to mute the tv-set. It was embarrassing to watch. In Seinfeld you had the cynical aspect of counting "I love you"s which very efficiently remove the awkwardness of having to hear these platitudes. Ironically this was in the episode where Friend's star Courtney Cox appeared as Jerry's girlfriend/pretend wife. The show also picked up the morality baseball bat and swung it just as well as the writers of Step by step and Full house rendering the show completely unwatchable.<br/><br/>Let's also not forget the horrendous repetitions of jokes:<br/><br/>* Ross plays the synthesizer, only he's not as good as he thinks<br/><br/>* Ross plays the bagpipe, only he's not as good as he thinks<br/><br/>The first was funny, the second was depressing.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the invention of family members after knowing the characters for 6-7 years. (Rachel didn't mention she had a sister to the rest of the group .. because it never came up? Please!) The writers are insulting the fans with stuff like this. How stupid do you think we are? Rachel's sister as well as Phoebe's bicycle skills/running technique were tantamount to a slap in the face.<br/><br/>The only reason I vaguely followed the show after it was apparent what they'd done to it, was a hope for the better. I now know that's not possible and will avoid the series finale as best I can. What can i say. This show freaks me out here. i have never liked this. But i have to comment this show to tell how bad it reallly is. The characters is completely brainless. i liked some episodes, but that was just few. why is this so popular. isnt any series better than THIS??? im getting very annoyed that people decide whats in or not. when are the end of all this mess??? As the title above says, I used to be a fan of this show, because I was able to deal with all the annoying aspects (Goddamn noisy laughs coming from nowhere and for no reason, silly plotlines, etc...) but I finally got sick of it and quit watching. <br/><br/>It's not only that the show is unrealistic, but the fact that the storylines have become kinda old, predictable and overused (Everybody trying and dating one another, all women pregnant or on the way to be, etc...) and the nail on the coffin to me was the appalling news that they had renewed for a ninth season. NBC should be ashamed of this. After all, as the cast haven't earned enough money so far, let's give them a few millions more. I find myself wondering: Why not use this money in promoting new and better shows?<br/><br/>
It's true what other users have written here - the cast is pretty lame at acting and the show is not funny, but the problem is you've got millions of people who like it. And I can't see how someone compare Friends to Seinfeld. The latter WAS a good show, and didn't have to rely on a cute cast for ratings. In Friends' case, it seems the cast was selected from a models' agency (In regards to the actresses, and they have gotten so thin and malnourished that it's sick to look at them now).<br/><br/>I only hope this season was definitely the last. First of all, to all the people who say it isn't realistic, IT'S A TV SHOW! Did you think "Seinfeld" (which I also loved) was in any way realistic? Please. By the way, Monica inherited the apt. from her grandmother, that's how they can afford it. You'd know that if you watched it regularly.  She told Joey that on the flashback episode when they first met and he took his clothes off while Monica was making lemonade. I don't understand how anyone could not think this is funny. The British person who said the London episode wasn't funny--are you daft? That was the funniest one ever!  It is the most consistently enjoyable show I have ever seen, and believe me, I've watched a lot of tv. All the actors are excellent and it is a true ensemble show--they're all equally important to the show. Even Ross and Monica, who both get on my nerves at times. It is a crime that no one has yet been recognized at Emmy time except Lisa Kudrow. She is wonderful but the others richly deserve some recognition also. I for one will be very distressed when "Friends" goes off the air. Why does everyone seem to love this show so much?  It's not all that great. In fact, I find it extremely boring.  It was pretty good when it first came out.  But now it seems like all of the episodes are the same.  Ever since the cast members started dating, the show has gone downhill.  It's just gotten kinda trashy almost.  The acting is good, but definitely not worth $800,000 for 20 minutes.  Most of my friends like Phoebe...they say that she's so funny.  I don't think she's funny at all.  Unless you classify ditziness and stupidity as funny.<br/><br/>It seems like there characters have nothing to do but have sex with each other and sit around on some couch at 'Central Perk.'  Don't they have jobs? Why are they never at them?  And they live in apartments yet they have a new outfit every single day that's all nicely ironed and in perfect condition.<br/><br/>And why aren't there any African American, Hispanic, Asian, or native American people on the show.  I don't even think that they've had any guests or even just extras who were of a different ethnicity besides white.  Where the heck are you going to go in New York City without seeing a single black or Hispanic person?  I mean...come on... This must be the most overrated show ever. This show is NOT GOOD. It's not funny, they just add a fake laugh every 5 sec so that the audiens knows ther're supposed to laugh. It's a rip off of the sit-com Seinfeld which is a really funny tv show. The main element of the show is that they don't evolve through out the show but the good writing in the show makes it so easy to like these characters anyway. Friends totalt blows that having bad writing and cringe jokes that just simple aren't funny. 1 out of 10 because it's not possible to rate 0! This show is the worst sitcom ever. Poor writing, poor directing and even worse acting, Friends is the televisual equivalent of getting hit in the face with mayonnaise. The most extraordinary thing about this series is that there is absolutely nothing remarkable about it. I have sat through many horrible episodes and experienced this bizarre feeling of actually being unable to laugh. I was so confused as to why this so called comedy had anything but comedy in it, and I really cannot understand how this atrocity can be called a great comedy. It is a sad state of affairs when people have become so brain dead and stupid that they think David Schwimmer should be allowed on TV, or Lisa Kudrow, or Matt LeBlanc, in fact, the entire cast are a bunch of useless, brain dead bunch of no talent hacks. Please people, stop watching and creating demand for this awful series. I still fail to understand why people are so fascinated by this awful show. What happens when you take a talentless cast, a bunch of brain-dead directors, and retarded writers, shake them up, and serve? You get Friends, or Fiends as I like to call it. Even the earliest episodes do not stand up to repeat viewings at all, as I learned a few months ago when I found a very hazy system cassette with three hours worth of the show on it.<br/><br/>That's another atrocity of this show: in this age of digital television and the struggle to make the public wake up and realise that films and television screens are NOT the same shape, Warner Television elect to film this programme using methods that the BBC would turn its nose up at. You can see in the early episodes that every episode is shot on videotape or a lower resolution film than 35mm, and while that might not sound bad to the same dullards out there who are trying to convince the DVD consortium to release cut and shut versions of films, those of us who take a little pride in photography and home cinema presentations know the picture resulting from methods like these looks god-awful. The blackout episode in season one is a perfect example of this: when all the lights go out, there is no detail whatsoever discernable in any scene. Contrast this with any recent feature film that was captured properly using anamorphic lenses and 35mm or better film, X-Men being my favourite example, and you can see why I hope programming like this doesn't survive the move to HDTV.<br/><br/>Poor cinematography aside, the characters are developmentally malnourished from day one, too. There is no way a character like Pheobe would go through all the things she claims and remain so bright and bubbly. Nor would she try to express herself through such underdeveloped musical skills. Indeed, the only character who comes close to resembling a fully developed human being with a brain is Chandler, who tells us a few reasons why he is the way he is. Unfortunately, therein lies another problem with the storytelling in Friends: we are told too much, and shown too little. Doctor Who experienced this problem once with a companion character, and when new editors and writers came in that valued the intelligence of the earlier serials, she was out faster than you can say "boring, staid character". None of the characters shown in Fiends show any difference, personality-wise, in the current season to how they were in the pilot. Guest stars are often written into any given episode, and this originally provided some relief from the monotony of seeing the same motions repeated endlessly, but that all fell apart with the recent episode featuring Denise Richards. Watch her in Wild Things, and you'll soon notice she could have had a lot more to do than give several characters something to ogle at. This is not say nothing of the fact that Ross' behaviour in this episode is completely inconsistent with his behaviour in every single previous episode. As a last example, a recently-seen episode here in Sydney which features Rachel recalling the time she made out with a fellow student of the female variety had so much potential to take the character off in a new direction. It was also one of the few times when we were shown some of the behaviour described in the past alluded to, rather than expected to just take it as read. However, as fast as the character was introduced, she left and that was the end of a tangent that could have sustained a little viewing interest. The show is full of threads like this that blossom for a couple of minutes, then are cut off with a meat cleaver.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this series is seriously overrated, poorly photographed, underdeveloped in story terms, and not that far removed from other asinine drivel such as The Brady Bunch. When characters show no signs of change in seven years, it is never a good thing. Please, please, stop screening repeats..it is beginning to look like irritating wallpaper as it's on TV so often. It was unfortunately my first completed comedy tv series honestly i enjoyed it earlier because i thought that nothing can be better than this one.
but then i watched other shows which are way too funny, had some good edgy jokes, realistic situational comedy, and real life relatable characters which changed my mind. there were no background laugh tracks after every joke to make audience realise that this is the joke now laugh on it in those shows unlike friends.
now i can say that friends is totally crap where nearly 95% of its jokes are unfunny and it is mindless comedy.which is good for people with low intellect if you criticize indian tv series on how bad they are on thier story line and character development then you should have guts to say that friends is the show which is totally mindless comedy with unrealistic situations.
where will you find a friend in real life who will pay all your expenses and debts everytime and give you place to live in his own house for that one friend who is dumb,unemployed,who is desperate for sex everytime and allowed a thief to rob all of his belongings because of his stupidity.
and yes the other BETTER SHOW i was talking about is the office Ross is, for the most, great and genuinely funny, as exemplified in the Fake Tan episode. When he gets into "meaningful" and "deep" heart-to-hearts or intrigues with Rachel though, he is insufferable.<br/><br/>Chandler is super-funny throughout.<br/><br/>Monica is excellent, particularly in the scenes depicting her obsessive and bossy behavior.<br/><br/>Phoebe is O.K. although sometimes her quirkiness gets a bit tiresome.<br/><br/>Joey is dumb and lascivious. He occasionally comes up with a funny quip but mostly it's about his love of junk food and humping everything that is remotely female. His I.Q. is unlikely to be above 50. What's his purpose on the show? Rachel... *sigh* A duplicitous, useless imbecile. She brings NOTHING to the show except, perhaps, a pretty face. She is not funny and she is not a convincing actress. That, per se, is bad. But spending SO much time on her and Ross' "relationship" makes her positively annoying. In the latter episodes I found myself fast-forwarding through all the sequences of her and Ross. But, and here is piece de resistance, what makes her UNBEARABLY IRRITATING are the values she represents and stands for. Throughout the series she chases after Ross employing sometimes despicable means (such as sabotaging his existing relationships); when she gets him, she drives him away, but the minute he then tries to form a new relationship with someone else, out come her old guerilla tactics to ensure that relationship fails. People like that used to be called female dogs, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>A dishonorable mention: The various guest "stars" (e.g. Bruce Willis or Jeff Goldblum). They overdramatize and behave totally unnaturally. It's like: "Hey, I'm a big-shot star on this big-shot sitcom, so I have to leave my mark, and the only way to do that is through affectation and by being outrageous." Willis, in particular, was unwatchable. Elle Macpherson, too, was bleak and nondescript. What greatly exacerbated this were the cheap hysterical canned laughs played after every line uttered by the guest "star." Oh yeah, and the apoplectic canned screams played at the entrance scenes of the guest "stars." Bottom line: If the series had been cut down to five instead of ten seasons, and if Rachel and Joey had been left out (or at most limited to intermittent guest appearances), this would have been an outstanding show. This way, it got jaded, predictable, tired and annoying halfway through. Friends was never anything extraordinary. Seinfeld did friendships better and The Jeffersons, Good Times and Newhart did 'residence comedy' better.<br/><br/>Despite that, it did have its charms. Lisa Kudrow added some heart to the show and the on and off relationships were realistic, if not endearing at times. Where the series kinda falls apart for me is the guys generally seem like lunkheads most of the time while the girls come out shining like daisies. While this also reflects some life situations, balance is good too.<br/><br/>Friends was good, it was trendy but ultimately it lacked the character and depth to keep me hooked. Friends is the funniest show I have ever seen. It is full of humor and romance. When people say that the show is raceist well thats just crap! This show has made me laugh and dry, and I think that if you don't watch this show you will be missing out on the funniest comedy ever! This is my favourite show on TV at the moment. Whenever I'm feeling down ao bored or anything in fact, I just put a Friends tape on and it just makes me feel so happy and warm, it has that affect on everyone I think, whether they're too desperate to be non-conformist to admit it or not. I stick by it when people say it's got worse over the last few years because I think if anything it's got better. Let me be one of the first people here to say I LOVE MONICA AND CHANDLER. Even if no one else does, I think they make a brilliant couple and they have a wonderful chemistry. I watched it religiously from the beginning but began to lose some of my enthusiasm during the mid-seasons, even going so far as to miss a few episodes! However, C+M's enchanting relationship got me hooked again, it breathed a breath of fresh air into a flagging show. It needed that change around. Their characters have changed slightly since, but I like the changes, everyone changes as years go by, especially when you're in such an important relationship. It would be unrealistic if they didn't change at all. I would say however that they should finish it soon. I will be very upset when it finishes, but I can't help but think that signing on for another 2 years was a mistake. I'm not really sure if they can keep it up, but I always keep a positive attitude towards it because I have faith that it will. I HATE FRIENDS AND EVERYTHING IT STANDS FOR! No wonder folks from other countries think Americans are stupid...Friends is hit show! A bunch of attractive 30 somethings trying to outcute/quip/clever each other with the most irritating dialogue and topics imaginable. Ho-hum.Which stage of Hell does the 24 hr "Friends" Channel play? All of them ...but as you descend there is one less bullet in the chamber. When "Friends" came out in 1994, I was still a teenager around 18 or 19. Right now I'm already 26 years old.  My younger cousin is already 20, she'll be 21 later this year.  She was like 12 when this show came out. Hell Britney Spears will be 21 later this year!!!  So exactly how old are these characters on this show supposed to be?  They're supposed to be single 20 somethings?  Yeah right.  These guys have to all be in their late 30s, slouching towards middle age.  With the exception of Jennifer Aniston.  And do they ever discuss age and getting older on this show?  I've been worrying about turning 30 and getting older since I was 23, yet the characters on "Friends" are perpetually stuck at age 20 or 21.    <br/><br/>I also want to talk about my cousin and his friends.  They are wannabe thugs.  They drive around listening to Tupac, DMX, Dr. Dre and all kinds of gangsta rap. They also talk like they grew up in the ghetto, like Compton or Harlem.  Then they go home to their White upper middle class suburban homes and watch "Friends".  It's been their favorite show for years. Whatever.<br/><br/>By the way I have always hated this show.  It's so fake and stupid. Friends is simply not funny. It's just way too overrated. I remember all the kids at my school were watching that show. I couldn't even watch a single episode. They'd keep asking me if I 'had seen Thursday's episode' or 'did Joey and Rachel (or whatever the hell their names are) get togher or break up' or whatever the hell happened. <br/><br/>It's not funny. It tries way too hard. It's about six people who live in New York. TOO OVERRATED, once again.<br/><br/>Stick with the classics: SEINFELD, THREES COMPANY, FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR. Basically, watch any sitcom on TBS or Nick At Nite except for this overrated trash, and you'll instantly fall in love. P.S. Seinfeld has, is, and always will be the best sitcom in history!<br/><br/>So, in the end, Friends is just way way too overrated. It isn't cool and it isn't funny. It's too uninteresting because these characters aren't like us. HELL, DO YOU KNOW A GUY WHO CAN'T HAVE KIDS? OR A GIRL WHO CAN'T HAVE KIDS? On the other hand, Seinfeld is all about 4 regular people and everything that happens to them on a daily basis. <br/><br/>Seinfeld is cleverly written, the way the stories interlock are somewhat Pulp Fiction-y, except there are very, very few flashbacks, like the classic Newman\Kramer at baseball game flashback. Seinfeld's scripts are smart and funny and classics. I mean, come on. How many times have you heard 'Master of your domain' and laughed? How many times have you heard some crappy quote from Friends somewhere other than the show?<br/><br/>Basically, this show stinks. It isn't funny. It tries too hard to be. It isn't appealing. It tries to make the characters like US, but it can't. Once again... DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN'T HAVE KIDS? DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS TORN BETWEEN BEST FRIENDS? IT IS RIDICULOUS.<br/><br/>Watch anything on Nick At Nite or TBS except for Friends. You'll love it. This sho is just too overrated. <br/><br/>FRIENDS STINKS. My mom liked this show when I grew up in the 90's and so I never cared to watch it. But now being in my mid 20's I finally did just to see if it held up to the hype and it's actually really funny. I see few low ratings on here by people who either don't have a sense of humor or just don't like sitcoms.<br/><br/>So if you actually have a sense of humor then I'd recommend this show. If you're a dull person who doesn't get comedy and probably gets mad at comedians for offense jokes even though they're "jokes" and you're just a big pos hypocrite because you only get upset when it offends you then yea, don't recommend. Meaning, the laughs don't always come from highbrow sophisticated hip 90's rot.
This is a completley binge-watchable series, as good as anything out there and better than most. It relies heavily on the characters personalities reacting to the nonsense that comes their way every episode.
Joey is the true star of this ensemble, and Rachel the sex object dingbat we all love, though she is a pain on the ass. Phoebe is an airhead, dispensing her cosmic POV constantly as if people might take her seriously, not realizing they tolerate her cause they love her. Chandler manages to be relevant with his nonsensical observations about love, life, and his lack of relationships while the brother sister duo of monica and ross do their best each week to kill the vibe.<br/><br/>Janice is a breath of fresh air, the giovanni ribisi character and that old hag from That 70's show make you want to barf. Ron Leibman should be banished from north america, and the fool who plays the cop that phoebe dates is embarassing, as is the so called sister played by reese weatherspook. Geez, does elliot gould not jsut make you wish he would go away? Christina Pickels, how did she ever get a job in show business?<br/><br/>And nobody, but nobody, would ever truly in real life buy Tom Magnum Selleck coupling with monica. The woman is a pyscho. To me, Friends will always be a show about dishonest people, one that would be completely without drama or intrigue if there wasn't always some sort of conspiracy or unnecessary lie keeping them from making any real progress. And yet, the constant sabotage keeps you interested, waiting to find out what happens next.
This show and I have always wrestled with each other. It's not particularly well written or even well shot, with all kinds of strange camera, audio-sync, and editing errors that are frankly impressive for a show of this caliber. I fall in love with the characters, and then they totally violate my understanding of them. It's intriguing, yet infuriating.
This show was groundbreaking, and it's beloved worldwide. But, I just can't quite get there. I respect this show, and I often enjoy it, but the tug-of-war is ongoing. Therefore, 7: good, but only passing. Friends it's about helping each other and make fun of each other. They show us they're together in sadness before happiness, what I'm saying is they show us the real friends, the friends they will be here for you no matter what. That's why I love Friends. To find a show just as funny, relatable, comforting and engaging 25 years from its air date is one fantastic show in my opinion. I find this is still my go-to show all these years later. The characters are simply fantastic, acting A* and the writers of this show are beyond talented. If you are reading this review in 2019 and haven't yet watched this amazing show, it is an absolute must. The best thing shown on TV throughout history and nothing will probably ever beat this series for as long as I live. The best sitcom I have ever seen by far! If it was before/after you time I'd still recommend watching it... It's genuinely amazing, and you'd be missing out if you don't give it a watch. Everyday dose of stress relief for majority of the world's population. Friends and it's characters are such an influence that we try to relate it in our group of friends, try to fit in dialogues. This proves what level of success this show has acheived, best comedy TV show then now forever. I'm just in love with every specific little thing about this show i'm thankful for bith Marta Kauffman and David Crane for making this amazing indescribable series that still catches our hearts even though it's been 20 years ! We the new generation and each coming new generation will always love and admire FRIENDS and laugh from within the heart because of it ! JOEY MONICA CHANDLER RACHEL ROSS PHEOBE are my life😍 Comedy with drama in brilliant mix and great ending These 6 fellows accompanied my 20s. This serie not only helped me study English also made me understand the culture differences,and fell deeply in love with it. I watched 10 times of this tv show, and preparing to learn another language still with this show😄. Whenever you feel stressed, watch Friends, your friends always there...even imaginary friends The show was amazing I watched it twice and I'm going to again! I enjoyed watching it every time and i have many friends who agree. The show has a great mixture of life lessons and comedy making anyone who watches enjoy it no matter their race, age, or gender. I recommend this show to anyone who needs a laugh and wants to ignore reality! One of the best series on TV! Amazing show!!!! I think, Rachel and Chandler its great actors. Monica and Chandler are beautiful couple. This show is forever! I Hope, they are return for one final movie chapter! I watch them again - 100% I love this people! this 100000 of 10!!! It is hands down the best sitcom ever made. It shows that the 90s-00s era will be the best era for comedies. There are a few great comedies nowadays but nothing will compare to this one. The characters had great chemistry together. I probably watch at least one episode a day. The reason a reunion wouldn't work is because of how great the show was and it would be ruined. Epic TV series...Can Watch it uncountable times and still Laugh like it was 1st time.One of the best sitcom of all time. Acting of Joey,Phoebe and Chandler is Something that can make many fans as one watch it.Every Episode of this series is perfect.Worth giving 20 min for this comedy. #hugefanoffreinds If anyone can answer this question, that would be amazing. I have seen a lot of TV and nothing has struck the chord like this. Granted its got flaws and plot holes, but who cares?<br/><br/>Then i start to think what was this that made FRIENDS the way it is<br/><br/>The characters are likable, relatable and pretty legit for the time<br/><br/>The situations they go into are the situations almost each of us get into<br/><br/>Your reactions would be the same if you had friends such as them <br/><br/>No convoluted plot points to make sure you savor the moment <br/><br/>Every character was given equal importance and their part in making sure you tear up<br/><br/>There was no re-casting, which made you so involved <br/><br/>Every guest appearance was unique in their own terms, they were not stereotypical, characters and just felt like part of the team <br/><br/>Friendshp is personified, work life balance depicted in the best way <br/><br/>It does not strive hard to spread any message at all, which makes it a treat to the eyes The jokes are timed perfect, sarcasm is used appropriately <br/><br/>Premise is way too simple and so is the end. It just feels like end of a episode but its the end of series. <br/><br/>Everyone's job is unique despite the fact that they were in high school together <br/><br/>I don't think any show was made biggest public influences than this None of the cast of any other TV show was on Oprah explaining to whole world their personal aftermaths of ending the sit-com I just could keep going on and on. but the list would be endless and it would different from every person's perspective of life and that again is a success. Each person could look at these episodes from their lens of life and can relate to them. Any party i have been whenever i say can we watch FRIENDS, there has never been a NO. That is how powerful and loving this is and By the way the opening song, best for any Sit-com.<br/><br/>I hated that they ended it, but looking at the actors now, i think its good that they did. They had their run and it has to stop somewhere and they stopped at the right time. Thank you to the cast and crew for giving us this marvel and i cannot thank enough the cast for their exceptional involvement and giving us this treat which i will cherish for ever and ever I was forced to see Friends, and since that day I can't stop watching them. They managed to stay 10 years with such a spectacular show, and from the star till the end we have hours of laughter... And if you haven't seen one episode of Friends please give it a chance... And trust me, if you love comedy, not hard comedy, but simple daily situations comedy, you will love this show. For me one of the best shows ever... And the only thing I hate about Friends is that they never did a Movie. Even now, after more than 10 years, I believe a Friends movie would be outstanding. So, if you're searching for something to relax and spend a good time after the hard working day, this is your answer. I haven't been a die hard for any films and series apart from FRIENDS. It's like,those five characters had became a part of my life.Instead of watching it, m living with this series.Holding fans for ten long years,that too without any repetition of any comedy scenes is really a hard work.More than entertaining,Friends had taught how to face serious problems faced in normal human life in an joyful and comic way.Enjoyable characters,Stunning performance by lead characters,Awesome guest appearances,Non stop comedy,unending romance,true friendship,excellent choice of title song,Video used for title song sequence all together made FRIENDS a Life time experience!!!!!!!!Rather than watching it,LIVE it!!!!<br/><br/>Rachel,Ross,Joey,Phoebe and chandler...!!!!The characters i wanna live with in my next life!!!!!! Friends is one of my top 5 comedies of all time. It has a really nice balance of being flat out funny and having characters that you can really relate to. Each character is different, which offers comedy for different senses of humor. It doesn't feel like the comedy is forced as with other shows. It really feels like a group of friends with very different personalities all hanging out. Unlike other comedies, it also really develops the characters and makes you somewhat invested in their lives, which allows them to have some more serious moments. Like all the good comedies, it's one you can watch over and over through the years. Life is not beautiful. Life is not perfect. But whenever I was watching friends, life felt good. The characters were so believable and lovable that you can't help but live the moments the actors were portraying for us. A feel good show which had its ups and down but everything was worth watching. All the lead characters have performed so well that it is not surprising at all that many fans still refer to all of them as Ross, Chandler , Monica, Joey, Phoebe and Rachel..<br/><br/>Among the talented lot.. 'Dr.' Ross Geller played by David Schwimmer is my favorite.. He is hilarious with the act of nerd who ends up in embarrassing situations many a time.. Chandler played by Matthew Perry is my close second favorite with his witty sarcastic jokes. Joey is also excellent with his dumb yet charming character. Phoebe with her eccentricity is hilarious. Monica is a control freak who hates to lose. And last but not least is Rachel is by far the most famous among the cast adds glamour to the friends cast. To the team of friends..thanks for all the wonderful memories.. Friends forever. Dear all, What should I say about this show. The writers, directors, composers & every cast and crew members of this sow deserves a standing ovation. The best comedy yet cultural show I have ever encountered. I am from India and I never used to watch Engish shows. But I started from Big Bang, HIMYM, ROE, The Middle, Seinfeld to name some of the best in comedy in my opinion but when I saw Friends, this stands out. What a dynamic and natural talents these actors had. I literally, yes literally fall from my bed laughing my ass off. The best Sarcastic person in comedy I ever seen is David Schwimmer & Matthew Perry. I cannot separate who is the best these 6 people were soul of this episodes, but still if someone insist I will say Jennifer Aniston & Phoebe happy go lucky cutiepie. Thanks to directors and all the members, actors & actress to make us laugh. Will there ever be a show so funny? A show that everyone talks about, a show that makes your day a whole lot better, a show that everyone can laugh out loud no matter how many times they watch it, a show that everyone still watches even today, over and over and over again. And a show, a show that has rules comedy for over 16 years! I'll answer that. No way in hell.<br/><br/>Okay I'm sure you heard of Friends, everyone has. If you watch it then you'll know what i'm talking about. Its absolutely hilarious, you could watch many shows but nothing would make you laugh harder. The only flaw of this series is that it finished in 2004! Ross, Rachael, Joey, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe. The gang. As the series developed you begin to fall in love with the characters, there just so amazingly likable. Although it's just a series, i think what people like the most about friends is the realism of it, 6 "average-classed" friends living in Manhattan, yet you'll get sucked into there lives, i seriously doubt there's even one episode that wouldn't make you smile, cry or roll-on-floor-laughing! It would be impossible for me to pick a favourite episode, there just all so good. If you are the strange one who hasn't seen friends and like comedy, then you haven't seen nothing yet! I cannot recommend this enough, oh how it kept me laughing through my teen years, all i know is that i would never stop watching it. You have to experience the laughs, love and chandlers sarcasm! Everyone see's friends as the show that never gets old, that's so true, you could watch the same episode a million times and still laugh like you watched it the first time.<br/><br/>Among everything else friends is actually educational, believe me? It teaches so many life lessons but in a unique, stupid and absolutely hilarious way. I hope my kids when they reach there teenage years can experience something so funny as friends.<br/><br/>Oh how we just all love the gang. All i can say is. If you haven't watched friends, your missing out on a whole lot of fun. If you used to watch friends, then you know how i feel about the show and if you still do watch friends, you, are the man! Or women! Best comedy show ever made hands down.<br/><br/>"Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault!"- Phoebe Buffay<br/><br/>"How you doin'"- Joey Tribbiani<br/><br/>"Stop staring at my wife's legs...no, no, stop staring at your sisters legs!"- Chandler Bing <br/><br/>"What is wrong with these pants!" - Ross Geller <br/><br/>"I don't care if the entire cast Eight is Enough comes out of there"- Monica Geller <br/><br/>"Oh my God. I've become my father. I've been trying so hard not to become my mother, I didn't see this coming."- Rachel Green Friends is the most-known and most-watched sitcom with no doubt.What makes it that popular is its heart-warming creature, characters that are so close to you and great writing. All six actors are marvelous on their roles. Jennifer Aniston shows what a great actress she's by playing Rachel Greene.(she won a Golden Globe award with Friends)But now she's playing in dumb romantic comedies. Courteney Cox makes me laugh so much with her jokes (as Monica Geller). Phoebe is the greatest stupid person ever (portrayed by Lisa Kudrow). Matt Le Blanc is hilarious as Joey(even there's a spin-off called 'Joey). Matthew Perry is sometimes the funniest male character of the show (as Chandler Bing). David Schwimmer is kindest character and nerdiest character of the show (as Ross Geller). 10/10<br/><br/>Best Seasons:Complete Series (10 seasons) This was a charming, but very slight, show for the first one or two seasons. The characters are not three-dimensional or realistic in any aspect, but basically just joke-spouting machines. The writers had some good jokes in the mid-90's early run of this show, but ultimately had to repeat themselves over and over and over. The main weakness is none of the characters are very witty or sardonic or intelligent or perceptive or insightful, which leaves them nothing to do but make juvenile jokes incessantly. Intelligent characters create more opportunities for humor, not less, but the creators of Friends decided to go with all dumb characters and recycle the same jokes over and over. Hey, it worked; big ratings winner; but about as infantile (and funny?) as the Flintstones. Half a dozen aging Gen Xers share their neurotic quirks with us every week. We've grown to know and love them. Their circumstances (and hair styles) have changed over the years, but their personalities have not.<br/><br/>
The early marketing hype for "Friends" almost prevented me from watching it. The ads implied that this show captured the essence of an entire generation in a way that had not been done before. I wanted to remind them -- and the public -- that another NBC show had already claimed to have done this thirty years earlier. It was "The Monkees." It wasn't true then, and it wasn't true in 1994. Fortunately, both shows were better than their hype.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast has been around long enough to outgrow the ridiculous image invented for them. The actors are all much older than the characters they play. The world they inhabit has no violent crime, no drugs, no poverty, no ethnic minorities and no sky-high Manhattan rents. (This isn't a criticism. It's a sitcom. I don't want reality!) It will be interesting to see how the show will look if it's still on the air in 2004. I could go through other sitcoms and go, "Ha ha, that was so funny, I forgot to laugh!" but this one is so funny, I don't think there was one episode where I didn't bust a gut laughing.  Even though I'm young (born in the mid 1980s), understand many of the jokes on TV, and have no clue how adult friends get along in real life. But if this is really what happens, I can't wait!  This show so funny, and I hope they go on for 50 seasons! One very commendable thing about this sitcom is that it has really distinctive characters. After watching just a few episodes, you get the feel of each and every of the six characters so well, the way they talk, how they'd react to stuff, etc. You could mention a line and it's easy to imagine how any one of them would say it, with whatever expressions or actions. That's pretty cool. And I like the stories of their lives. Sometimes it actually is kinda meaningful, yet it never stops being funny. "Friends" is definitely my favourite TV show (together with "That 70s show") It is about the lives of 5 childish grown-ups that are very funny. My favourite character is Joey because he is the funniest and stupidest one.<br/><br/>What I don't like about these season is that Ross is whining all the time because he got divorced again. These leads to the first season when he finds out that his wife was a lesbian.<br/><br/>"Friends" is the show with the best cast ever. They are all professional actors that we've all seen in many successful movies. I heard the rumor that Rachel (Jennifer Anniston) might quit "Friends" next season and I hope she doesn't because they wouldn't have a show without her.<br/><br/>The thing is that Rachel might quit because she wants to spend more time with Brad Pitt. Supposedly, "Friends takes a lot of her time. Hey, get real, Brad Pitt will be also very busy doing about a million movies. If she quits, They should hire Mira Sorvino because they look alike. Anyway, I hope this show lasts for a long, long time. I guess I don't have to explain a lot about this show cause this show is a legend. Everyone knows FRIENDS. I usually watch this in tough days, it helps me to relax! Nothing ever could make me stable, but friends. Since I began watching the season 3, it felt so home. I've completely fell in love with while I've not finish yet Really liked it how the show represented friendship and relationship staff This sitcom is extraordinary. Kudos to the wits of the writers. They have created a generation defining, evergreen, universal show. It's funny, emotional, witty, stupid all at once and in a good way. The characters grow on you and at one point you feel you are with them. So much emotional side of each character has been explored that you feel like if you bumped into them someday you would feel like you are reunited with old friends. Never have I ever come across a sitcom which changed the way I think of life, this one did. A bunch of friends who live in the same city, going through ups and downs of life and supporting each other. At some level it challenged me to be like one of them, to be a better friend. I liked how they have shown that none of the characters are perfect and yet perfect in their own way. For someone who is in 20s or early 30s it is quite relatable. At times you realize the sloppy writing, but the emotional quotient overpowers that and you allow that to happen. Total bingeworthy. This is by far the best sitcom I have ever watched. Having watched other immensely successful sitcoms like the office, I would ascertain the character development in friends is incredible. Most of the characters by the end of the show did not change their character from what it was at the beginning of the show. There were too many moments that were emotionally connected to me which is where David and Marta Kaufmann done a fabulous job. Monica has this finicky character which some of the audience might not like but her other aspects more than make for it.<br/><br/>Initially, Chandler's character looked the most comical during the first two seasons but after that Joey's character stood out to best in the series throwing up with instantaneous jokes that would tickle most of the bones in our body.<br/><br/>The scene where Joey is asked to describe the relationship between Monica and Chandler and add something about the love he consciously uses alliteration with loving....sharing.....giving....taking.... even after he inadvertently uses a better description of how they meant to him. That is the best scene of the series. Friends follows 3 men and 3 woman: in New York City in the 90's and early 2000's
Monica Geller who is a chef and a crazy neat freak
Chandler Bing: whois sarcastic and makeslots of jokes
Ross Geller: Monica's older brother who is a Paleontologist who gets divorced 3 times during the series and has 2 children throughout too
Rachel Green: A spoiled girl who ran away from her wedding but ends up working in fashion who also was Monica's best friend , the popular one, and Ross's crush in high school
Pheobe Buffay: Had a hard childhood but is very quirky
Joey Tribbiani: The ladies man An exceptional sit-com, that can not be replace by any TV-SHOW. When i was first watching this show . All i just expected was a light comedy so that could kill my time whenever i was boring. But then as the seasons going up, everything changed.I then started to brought my emotional feelings, the show was beyond than just a comedy ... It started to tear you apart, drop you in tears. At least in my exprience, a guy who doesnt love romance-comedy at all , I cried like a baby.<br/><br/>It's so rare to see casts that dives really deeply into their characters that you wouldn't be able see if this is a show or real life. It even changes a lot of my perpective about us, human. This show just shows me that people are so complex and complicated with all those various emotions, our life with people around us are meant to be sometimes rough and sometimes smooth. All we just need to do is to live up with that along with the emotions as we cant just expect our life with FRIENDS to be always happy.
THIS SHOW NOT JUST GAVE ME ENTERTAINMENT BUT ALSO LESSONS OF LIFE at least in my opinion.
At the end.. sorry if my english are messy i am not really good at writing. That's the best show ever. The comedy, drama, plot, characters and setting all of them were the form of that masterpiece. I'm in love with it, and I don't think that I'm gonna watch any other serie. Love you guys. This show is amazing, no other sitcom is even comparable to this one. All characters - joey, phoebe, rachel, chandler, monica and ross are seriously my best friends thanks to this amazing show. All comic timings and scenes are superb, acting is awsome and emotional scenes are so good that i always get tears in my eyes. This is an amazing experience, more than just a show and people who don't like this seriously have no sense of humor. Friends is not a TV show. It is a phenomenon because it happens once in a lifetime. One of the most endearing, genuine, and funniest sitcoms to ever exist. Never have I had an attachment to a cast of characters before Friends, the characters are addictive and inspiring. Their problems and everyday life are a world away, yet still so universal that their lives succeed in connecting with the utmost sincerity. Friends is a timeless masterpiece. I loved this show. I saw every episode 3 if not 4 times each. I will say I sometimes just want to buy all the seasons. I thought the cast is good. The acting was great. A good look at reality when you move out on your own. I didnt watch an episode of this until 2012. I've watched the series multiple times since. The cast had great chemistry. Because of that, they really stood out and that took a pretty basic concept for a show and made it shine. I'll admit theres a lot that I disliked about story, but that has more to do with my personal opinion and not something the show did wrong. Was not a fan of the Ross/Rachel relationship. The show suffered throughout. The series finale couldnt have been more obvious, because they had no other choice but to end it the way they did. Despite my opinion on the toxic relationship that was Ross/Rachel, it is a good show. One of the greatest shows ever made. This show teaches you the true meaning of friendship with never ending laughter and hilarious gags. Awesome show. Awesome characters. Awesome lifestyles. Awesone actors. Love them. An absolutely perfect SitCom. Immensely funny with great characters, and a well written drama element. o I love it and I have sene it 3 times! This is the Best show and I have watched a lot. 12 out of 10 love it! And it is fun and nice. By far one of the most overrated sitcoms in the history of television! I've even tried watching it now that I'm older Beyond my 30 something's and it is still boring boring boring! Season 8-10 are horrible!!!!! Monica & chanler are always talking about "making a baby" that becomes the only topic they talk about forever & rachel & ross are now consumed with their baby. It feels like joey & Phoebe are the only interesting characters that have a storyline that's different every episode. Monica also becomes really rude & controlling towards the way she treats her husband basically making chanler feel a toy. I loved her character up until this point because now she treats her husband in such a disgusting way. Its really insulting The over extended story of six young people looking for love with the right guy or gal was funny for a while, but eventually ran out of steam. It boasted many memorable moments, but also plenty of groaners to go with it, usually in the form of various guest stars who's guest spots were pretty badly exploited and under utilized (like Bruce Willis, Ben Stiller, Alec Baldwin, Jon Lovitz, etc). Billy Crystal & Robin Williams had a fun bit once though, but Tom Selleck was the only guest star to have actually had a respectable character.<br/><br/>When they came up with the Joey/Rachael storyline coupled with Rachael getting pregnant and giving birth to baby Emma, the wheels had most definitely fallen off the wagon.<br/><br/>But then again, that should have been obvious from the 1999 season finale in Las Vegas. The only real highlight of that finale was watching the Rachael dis-robes and walks around naked in her apartment sequence, allowing everyone a look at the then 29 going on 30 Jennifer Aniston bear her 5'5" figure in the dark lit sets of Warner Brothers. The staff clearly spent the last of their talent writing that scene and Rachael's embarrassment at dis-robing herself even though there was no one around to see her naked and her quick adjustment to being naked in her home and the forbidden joy of it.<br/><br/>
6 stars out of 10. Boring, forced laughter makes no sense. Stinky old show. I'll just say this has to be the most overrated TV show in history of the world. I don't hate it or anything, I just don't see why does it have such a high rating or why did so many people love it? I'm dumbfounded. being born in 1992,i remembered watching friends with my aunt,sister and mother when i was young I'm in my twenties now, i saw the show was on comedy central and added it to my recordings and within a few weeks i have a collection hundreds of episodes to watch. i watch a couple of episodes everyday and average of one/two laughs every episode (provided by Chandler/Ross/Phoebe) (joey really made me laugh at the "thursday third day" line). i won't bad mouth this show because it is a decent show to watch but as a comedy, the hype and excitement around it is exaggerated. maybe as a guy it doesn't really excite me that much (so much to say the best show ever) most of the story lines are about relationships and happy endings.. its like an escapism. i like the cast, i like the show but it just doesn't have that gutso i would rate it 7 out of 10 but simply because of its over hyped I'm going to give it a 4. NOT FUNNY AT ANY TIME!!!!!!<br/><br/>A show about 6 people that ends up being a show about 6 people that is about absolutely about nothing. <br/><br/>Settings are absurd not realistic at all so far fetched you can't even believe these people would even be friends EVER.<br/><br/>This is Seingfeld w/o Jerry and that too is a bad show. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time trying to watch this lame show with bad writing, bad acting.<br/><br/>I its very difficult to sit through 30 minutes of this show let alone the back to back reruns many stations are running now. I sometimes accidentally find it on when I am not paying attention, it quickly gets turned off. This show is undoubtedly the best thing on TV as far as comedy is concerned. Those of you who can't see it need to take life less seriously and enjoy it!  Communist B@ast@rds!!  Don't trash the show!  You have a lousy sense of humour.  The guy from England who trashed the show...how dare you speak badly about friends?  Have you seen your humour?? For the love of God, British humour is scarier than The Evil Dead and Exorcist were back in their day! Friends is a great show.  If you have a sense of humour and still aren't crying about someone who dumped you years ago (hence unable to enjoy anything) get a life and talk less crap...or i'm gonna whoop yo ass all the way to NYC so you can see what Friends is all about. And just for that English pig or piglet...i'm not America...countrywise or continent wise!! If you want bland characters then watch this. If you want homophobic jokes everywhere then watch this. Its just six friends who talk about sex in a coffee shop every single episode. Out of all the criticism I see from the one and two star reviews, no one addresses the lack of diversity with the leading casts. I only watched three episodes and I didn't like how "white people" were the main characters in a show about "friends and inclusion." I did further research, asked friends, and realized I'm not the only one who thinks that this show ain't it. Friends is just simply the most hilarious programme ever made. About 6 friends who live in Manhattan. Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Monica and Chandler. My favourite has to be Ross, his facial expressions are immensely funny and his dialogue will have you laughing out of your chair. Joey's funny stupidity makes him one of the most popular characters and Monica's self obsessive and petulant behaviour is realistic and funny. Although it has finished, Friends will be remembered for years and years to come and will be remembered as the most genuine comedic programme!! It is truly a comedic genius of a programme! it's hard for me to belive such a boring and dumb show is so popular. i think this show sucks and should have been cancelled in 1998, or even earlier! it's not funny and the charecters are so so fake and bitchy. rachal is a snobby bitch, monica is old and mean, phoebe is a dumbass, chandler has over done the sarcasism, joey is an idiot, and ross is an ugly pussy. and these "friends" can be very mean to each other. don't waste you thursday night watching this overatted trash. watch family guy on fox. at least you'll laugh instead of being bored. The Iconic Sitcom which pretty much 'Singlehandedly', If you leave Seinfeld out of the scene, (Although the two shows serve in an entirely different perspective) defined the television comedy landscape through the entire course of its 10 year run, stretching from the mid 90s to the early 2000s. Besides receiving numerous awards, earning Millions and making Multi- millionaire cast members,, the show established itself as the classic blueprint for various subsequent character- driven sitcoms. Just as the spirit of the 'The Simpsons' runs through every adult animated sitcom, so too does the spectre of Friends continue to hang over most of today's mainstream sitcoms.<br/><br/>'Friends' was an incredibly funny show for most of its run. It felt fresh not because of its approach to comedy but because it featured relatively novel and moderately idiosyncratic characters played by wonderful actors. It also connected with a lot of late-teens and 20- somethings who took vicarious pleasure in a show featuring a set-up they could relate to. As Marta Kauffman, the show's co-creator succinctly put it recently, 'Friends' "was about that time in your life when your friends are your family".<br/><br/>Lastly Who could forget the ever changing concept of flirting with the catchiest, cheesiest or dumbest yet sweetest pickup lines that the sitcom gifted us with; though Joey Tribbiani stands out here,"How You Do'n?" The most famous line from FRIENDS. As a matter of fact, I bet You'd find it extremely hard if you try to find A guy in the Late 90's or early 00's who hasn't tried it at least once! Although results may vary, but We tried, WE DID!<br/><br/>~ @asifahsankhan I realized that one of the closest things to my heart is going to end forever, six episodes before the last. So much so that despite being a contained person as myself, I began posting constant whatsapp statuses about it, talking to all my friends everywhere, how it was all going to be over for me, forever. <br/><br/>Then came the second last episode, two days later. After watching that episode, I couldn't bear to watch the last one. Not just because all of it was going to get over, but also because the way it was supposedly going to get over. I knew Ross and Rachel would end up together, but Monica's house would be gone. The group won't be hanging out any more. At least not as often as they used to. Everyone was getting settled in their life. <br/><br/>I had come to terms with the fact that it was going to end. But this way? I can't even imagine them beyond the series? When Harry Potter series ended, it was devastating for me. But at least it ended on a note that gave me the thread to extend it post the ending. To imagine how their daily lives might be like. The second last episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S, however, made me immensely sad.<br/><br/>Two days later, I shut my room and saw the last episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. It was the best ending ever. <br/><br/>I will tell you how. I will avoid the spoilers. Those who know the ending, know how perfect it is, despite all the fears that accumulate on watching the second last. Apart from that, I cherish the fact that now they are a part of my life. Now I have the chance to re-run the whole series (which I am doing currently) and watch it from the perspective of different characters and I must tell you, it is just as funny and light hearted as it was when I watched it for the first time. <br/><br/>It won't be a hyperbole to call F.R.I.E.N.D.S a classic. It is, hands down, the most famous series ever made. 21 years post it's pilot, people are still watching it and enjoying it more than the current running series. F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the scale. The quality of other series are measured in comparison to it's standard.<br/><br/>Despite it's yesteryear limitations of technology (they were using flip mobile phones in their last season!), guest roles that would hardly excite the current generation, the storyline, theme and dialogues of the series are so timeless that they have achieved eternity. And so you still find Taylor Swift, Adele and many other major artists talking about watching the series, like it were something still being telecast for the first time. Just likes it's eternity making it cut through generations, it is a series which, no matter how many times you watch it, will make you feel the same way it did for the first time. It is the best stress buster. It is F.R.I.E.N.D.S! Most Comedy Series I criticized.<br/><br/>an excellent TV show. All of the actors are excellent,so many and so failed romantic scenes. love, love,separation, tears of Rachel and Ross, the return of Rachel and Ross,tears of Rachel and Ross, the return of Rachel and Ross. it is clear that most of us get bored from love of Rachel and Ross.<br/><br/>* Pheobe Buffey how can a reasonable person to become so crazy? Impossible, Joey foolish, stupid, we find like him but Phoebe she is not stupid, but her scenes very crazy.<br/><br/>* Monica Gellar best female character in this series - she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong.<br/><br/>* Rachel was not convinced by me, but she has one thing in her..we need for someone like Joey to know what it is .<br/><br/>*Chandler in the first 4 seasons, almost before his love to Monica was the best, his passion to her dropped him down in my opinion then joy appears .<br/><br/>* Ross - fixed level from start to finish, he is talented .<br/><br/>Friends failure to be a Comedy - Romance Series.<br/><br/>Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgment I didn't watch Friends when I was growing up but due to its huge popularity I obviously had to check it out. I do not regret this one single bit.<br/><br/>The show had me drawn in since its first scene and that feeling didn't leave until the very last. With a great sense of humor and a great overall atmosphere you can't help but fall in love with the show. <br/><br/>The best thing though in my opinion is the characters. Those 6 friends will make you fall in love with their really great and individual personalities.<br/><br/>Whenever I'm bored or sick I watch this show, it's one of the only ones I can watch countless times without getting sick of it. <br/><br/>The show is a masterpiece deserving of its popularity. The series revolves around the lives of six young New Yorkers who are also the best of friends. The series has an incandescent sense of humor that runs during its entire run. A mix of sarcasm and quirkiness the series will make you laugh and cry with it. But what makes this series most authentic is the fact that you will realize that most of the events that happens in the series can be related with our own lives.Be it the romance, the friendship or the break ups you will go on a journey that will soon make you say, "What next?". The quality of the punch lines is a rare findings in the sitcoms that are made nowadays My personal favorite I would recommend it as a must watch for everyone. I have given perfect ratings for some movies and shows but nothing is as perfect as this show. I don't think there will ever be another show that could make you laugh so much. The amazing thing is that it doesn't switch off its funny touch in any episode. <br/><br/>Yes, all the 236 episodes are simply breathtaking that I have made it a routine to watch it every day and you know what, it still makes me feel happy. The acting is amazing, the characters are so lovable and the plot is perfect. The character development is subtle and slick that you never feel the change in the tone of the series as the characters and plot age and evolve. One of he biggest achievement of the series is being hilarious with minimal (if at all any) profanity.<br/><br/>A perfect series that everyone should watch in their lifetime. Each episode will make you laugh and feel good. Absolutely brilliant!! I love this show!! I must have seen every episode at least 3 times and it never fails to make me laugh.<br/><br/>The characters are brilliant, lovable and funny it there own ways. My personal favourite is Phoebe because she is crazy and funny (she reminds me a bit of myself!!). <br/><br/>This show is brilliantly written and will still be hilarious in 20 years.<br/><br/>It is also a show that knew when to stop. Too many TV shows go on too long and aren't funny anymore. With Friends, every series is funny and perfectly written. I just finished watching friends. I can not believe that it has ended. one of the best shows I have ever scene and perhaps will remain the best ever. I have learned many things from this show, the most important one is "Cherish each and every moment with your friends, they will always be there for you".....'sure...where????' LOL. Okay so the ending was very unexpected and i must say it was very emotional too. I felt like crying but was laughing my ass off as well! I simply can not stop myself from praising the show every now and then. The plot, characters, story line etc was just perfect. I miss the show already :( I hope that they make new seasons. I discovered Friends while I was studying in UK. And I fell in love with the show. All the episodes were excellent. Hilarious, smart, the script was very well balanced. The characters were well defined and there is a central idea in the show: the life of 20something in the 90s. Their struggle to find jobs, their personal lives and their constant fun. I can not choose my favorite character. It was one of the shows I loved them all. I suppose it had to do with the fact that they were having a good time behind the scenes as well. I think one of the reasons it was such a success, it was that it reminded us the importance of friendship, of being with people you love and they ll accept you for what you are. I miss them a lot. I have seen all seasons of FRIENDS for 4 times now. and i still enjoy watching it everyday in my life. It is not like some other series that you see and forget, it actually becomes a part of life. For every time, i think what i am going to do this weekends. and the first idea that always comes to my mind is, I'll grab a bear and watch Friends for the whole day.<br/><br/>All the 6 actors have done a great great job. it never felt like they were acting, it all looks so natural.and i am glad that i could see this best show ever. and as FRIENDS fan, it's never like i finished or completed the series. it's like I'll keep watching it forever. Monica will always be cooking and chandlers' joke will always make me laugh. Joey will always try to get part in movie and so on... Thanks to the writers and all to make such a great show. Okay....So this is like one of my favorite show on the whole world. I watched "Chuck" and "DDD" and "OUAT" but this is seriously one of my favorite shows ever....I first saw this in Serbia (i am from there), and when i wanted to download it, i saw that it has like 10 season, and i was like "there is no way i am gonna download that". But than somehow i did it. And know i watch this every night, and it makes me laugh so bad...Its so hilarious, and funny...Whenever i am sad, or not in mood i just watch one episode and i forgot why was i sad....I love every single character in show, but my favorite are Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani....I am know at season 9, and i am so sad that a almost watch it all, but i promise myself that i will watch it all over again....:)) I am sorry for my English, its not perfect.... This thing is one of the most amazing TV shows of all times! I watched this show 3 times! It's worth it! It might look old or something like that, but it does not matter it is amazing! You will love the 6 crazy friends who are adorable and very very funny. It has super strong friendships and some drama/romance. I do have to warn you, you will get attached to these beautiful characters, you will cry when it ends, but don't let that stop you! Please, watch it, you will not regret it! I am only saying this because I really want you to see it because I'm 100% sure that you will enjoy it! And if you haven't watched it yet, you're missing big time! I admit it. I haven't watched a single episode of Friends until two weeks ago. After watching some random episode I thought 'Hey! This ain't so bad', so I decided to give it a try. Now, two weeks later I'm halfway through season 9... I really got drawn into this show. You start to care for those six people like they were family. Each character has his own perks and flaws and that's why you start identifying with them. And with 3 guys and 3 girls there's really enough material to appeal to both men and women.<br/><br/>Even though I love the characters and the comedy, I can't give this show the full 10/10 because, after 7 seasons, plots are starting to repeat themselves, I especially got tired of the whole Ross & Rachel situation after a while. Also this show often contradicts itself. While in the beginning Ross has "only slept with one women" (His ex-wife Carol) somewhere in season 6 or 7 Chandler reveals that he slept with some cleaning lady in college which simply is not possible. Stuff like that happens quite a few times and I sometimes get the feeling that the writers forget to watch their own show. Those flaws really do bum me out and keep me from really 100% getting into this show.<br/><br/>Still great, 9/10. Friends is and always will be the best t.v show ever! I was at least 5 episodes a day and even though I can say the words with them, I still laugh hysterically at every joke! I don't know one person who does not like this show! <br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>Rachel Green, spoilt girl, who relies on daddy's credit card leaves her fiancé Barry at the altar. She runs to her old friend Monica (high school friend). Monica puts a roof on her head and lasts for 10 years. Monicas has a brother Ross who Rachel ends up going out with on a on and off relationship. Chandler Ross' best friend from college lives across the hall from Monica and has a roommate called Joey. And its hard to put Pheobe in as we don't really know her history but ... Shes in the group too! LOL <br/><br/>Hard to explain but just a caring group of 6 friends who spend their life gossiping away in the coffee house, Central Perk ! Friends is one of my ultimate favourites (number 1) this show is full of fun laughs that still lingers in your mind and still makes you life and the coolest characters- their sense of humour which is so special that it brings the show to life...and they are all charming and unique: Phoebe with her hippie personality and weirdness and her musical talent... Joey with his boyish good looks, flirty and dopey personality ( his chat up line: "How U Doin'?") Monica with her obsessiveness, shrill and competitive persona, Ross with his many divorces and a thing for dinosaurs (Monica's response "when are those going to become extinct?") Rachel gives off the spoilt brat, daddy's girl aura yet she is sweet... and finally chandler(my ultimate favourite character) with his overall good nature, sarcasm, cheeky personality, legendary wit, and non-stop barrage of jokes. This show has truly touched lives and and always be remembered by millions - this show will live on for a hundred years Four years ago, after the series final I would've said this is the best comedy sitcom ever made. t After watching it's reruns, now with cold head, I can only say it's a triumph of American Comedy. Sure, one of the most successful and popular comedies ever made but it's no lie that it isn't 100% about quality.<br/><br/>From season 1 to 4 the show is a complete mess with unfunny situations, SNL imitation sequences, and awkward performances.<br/><br/>The show starts to get a unique vibe and special charm since 1999. To be honest, the humor gets more witty and leaves behind cheesy lines for raunchy humor instead; but keeping the typical American humor all the time.<br/><br/>Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer shine all the time while the rest of the cast does it very fine and even gain status as people's favorite characters on any sitcom.<br/><br/>The situations are tremendously creative from 1999 on and I can't think of any other show to perfectly manage the facial expressions of it's cast. It's also part of the charm of the comedy; pretty people performing decently even with their faces.<br/><br/>Give this show a try and be part of American pop culture. There are few shows that come as close to perfect as FRIENDS does; with its nonchalant charm, its beloved characters and its hilarious plot lines, FRIENDS is a enjoyable sitcom that really makes you feel like you know its characters, for in a way you do. Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry head-up this popular TV show that has been a great addition to everyone's weekly sit-down-to-watch-TV periods. Each character is special and unique, and all equally funny. Ross has the greatest faces, and can make me laugh until I cry. Rachel is hilarious with her witty comebacks, Monica just has this way about her that gets me every time. Chandler, of course, has this sarcastic humor that constantly cracks me up, and Phoebe has a wild and wacky way about her that really gets to you. And then there's Joey. Joey is the stupid one, who also happens to be in my opinion the funniest. Joey is a really great comedian and can make anyone fall on the floor laughing! The whole show of FRIENDS is definitely the best ensemble cast ever, and in all the best TV sitcom ever made. "FRIENDS," in my opinion, is a pure definition of must-see TV! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny whenever a mishap occurred. I always laugh at them. As a matter of fact, I think just about every single episode I've seen was funny. The only character that annoyed me to death was Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, she's the kind of character you want to slap silly. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good. Possibly the most over-rated show in the history of television. And I can't understand all the fuss people make about Jennifer Aniston. She's really nothing special at all.<br/><br/>The whole "Friends" thing is definitely an example of "The Emperor's New Clothes" syndrome if you ask me. That such a load of old pony could get to be so popular speaks volumes about the collective taste (or lack of it) of the contemporary viewing masses.<br/><br/>I now brace myself for the inevitable deluge of derision from this show's legions of loyal followers. But that IS and will remain my honest opinion of it - overrated, annoying and extremely unfunny. 0 out of 10. Why is it in America whenever something is great they have to ruin it? Songs on the radio that get played every 10 minutes, horrid movie sequels (Casablanca with Jlo????), and great tv shows that just don't know when to throw in the towel.<br/><br/>I realize that whether Friends is still good or bad is not the issue when it comes to business and advertising. As long as people still watch the show NBC can sell their advertising spots at a very high price. The quality of the show is not relevent. So sad.<br/><br/>When friends first aired and people started talking about it I refused to watch. I thought 6 pretty people who all are friends in NYC? Not interested. It was only by the 3rd or 4th season when it was still going strong that I decided to watch it. Much to my surprise it was hilarious! I was completely hooked. I was so glad that they put the reruns on other channels so I could see all the great stuff I missed.<br/><br/>It was a great ensemble cast. Often I pondered which charactor I liked the best and the least, while Ross always came up as the most annoying while discussing friends with anyone he actually was a very good charactor. They all had something about them that made them almost equally interesting and funny. I never was disappointed if they focused more on one charactor than another. I thought the show was very well acted and the actors had great comedic timing. I must say that throughout Chandler was probably the funniest and most adorable. This brings me to my point;<br/><br/>Friends "jumped the shark" a long time ago. I don't remember the exact moment, but Chandler and Monica, in my oppinion the worlds worst couple getting married? No, no no. Them dating was actally kinda cute, but them being married like on many other shows just killed the story line. Chandler was funny single, insecure guy who had a great personality but was clueless with women. Also, I realize that just by virtue of their age that him and Joey still living as roommates would seem unlikely, but them living together and the scenes with them were some of the funniest on the show. Monica was funny in her own way, but her and Chandler together killed the funniest parts of the both of them. Monica's neurosis's just got intensley annoying as she henpecked Chandler draining him of all his humor.<br/><br/>Ross and Rachel having a baby? Ok, I liked Ross and Rachel together. They were a great couple because they were so different. The geek and the prom queen. They had real chemistry, but now, years later when they had one last fling and she got knocked up? I always thought that they should end friends with Rachel and Ross falling for each other again and maybe end the series with their marriage, but that clearly won't happen again because as we see now their fling was a drunken meaningless one and now Rachel lives with Ross and all they do is annoy the crap out of each other becasue they both still want to date other people and now it's considered rude and insensitive.<br/><br/>This last episode reminded me of the last Seinfeld, which I hated, where they portayed the charactors in just the worst possible light. Phoebe's long lost lover comes back from Minsk and she reunites with him but is still in love with another guy, Mike. She keeps saying Mike when she's addressing David. How cruel and unlike her real charactor. It was terrible. I thought they could have summed Phoebe up by bringing her back with David who she seemed to truly love years back and was devastated that he had left.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Joey and Rachel.I must admit it was a little exciting to see them kiss and weird too, but the whole thing is just a little too incestuous. Rachel has a small baby from the former love of her life on a one night stand and now one of his best friends is gonna start something up with her? I realize stuff like this does actually happen,but it's a little pathetic and don't want to see it on a show I used to love. This is like all those shows that get so desperate for story lines that they have celebrity appearances and go to > hawaii....It's just time to pull the plug. I was in the Sixth Grade when friends first aired.  It wasn't as funny as seinfeld but it was close.  The first three seasons of Friends were absolutely hilarious.  But as I look back on the plot lines, they focused on the wrong things.  The things that make me laugh like no other are pheobe being pregnant with her brothers twins and needing to eat meat, rachel dressing up like a cheerleader to get a guy, joey being on days of our lives etc.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT ROSS AND RACHEL or CHANDLER AND MONICA.<br/><br/>Focusing on this well,  . . . crap, has permanently made the reruns of this show unwatchable.  7 years after it started, ross and rachel are still a big question mark. How ridiculous.  And when you watch reruns of the show, the center of the show is jockeying between which friend is dating who and who's freaked out about marriage at the time.  Who wouldn't have guessed that chandler would "flip out" at his wedding, he'd been doing it for 7 years.<br/><br/>Also, i saw a recent episode that relied completely on jokes started in the first season.  Everyone at chandler's work thought he was gay.  "hahaha" make an episode about it.  But then every episode after the same shtick starts.  in the ninth season, ross still cries out, "if rachel wants to kiss other guys, then so will I!" to which chandler looks at him with a "?!?!??!?!?!?!?" expression.  I rest my case.  it's just not funny.  the characters weren't that original to start off with.  This show should have ended after the 5th season.<br/><br/>Friends is its own world.  I live in new york, and i have never seen ANY sort of life like that of the friends crew.  I've never sat in a an all caucasion coffee house or gotten an exec job at ralph lauren with "waitressing at central perk" as the main part of my resume.  Sit coms all have their individual problems, but friends needs to quit while it's ahead. I'll still watch the older episodes and laugh myself silly. They should have been making one million an episode then when they were actually trying to produce something funny and worthwhile and not just letting the series play out with no work.<br/><br/>And as for the individual characters, recently, all of them except joey are SO irritating i can't even make it through a show.  I miss the days of Rachel spraining her ankle and having no insurance and of monica trying to become a chef.  What do they do now?  well, that's a good question . . . i think they do nothing (rachel doesn't even take care of this baby that "resurrected the show," the nanny carts her around) apparently it's something so entertaining and important to society that NBC feels it should center a show around it for another year.  Or maybe they know people are hanging on to friends until it ends.  So they won't have followed it all this time and missed the last season. How can anyone dislike this show, it's so goddamn watchable. If you don't find it funny, perhaps you don't like to laugh, since the humour is varied enough to appeal to practically everyone (witty oneliners, recurring jokes, over-the-top sarcasm, bizarre sight gags...how many other ways are there to be funny?). Besides, 'Friends' is about life and relationships; anyone disinterested by this must be bored by living itself.<br/><br/>And of course it has cracking characters.<br/><br/>I'm only 18, and it's hard to believe I've already lived through the entire 'Friends' saga.<br/><br/>This show will be funny to see again when I'm sixty.  I'll chuckle with my wife about the memories the show holds, just like my parents do now about ancient comedians who I fail to find funny.<br/><br/>'Do you remember? And Monica was so tidy she used to clean the toilet while people were using it! And the guys and girls had a quiz once, and the girls bet their appartment and lost it to the guys because they couldn't remember Chandler's job! And that Joey guy was this really terrible actor, who said that every time he had to cry on set, he'd just take a pair of tweezers, stick them down his pants, and "just start pulling"!!!'<br/><br/>In a word, unbeatable. I have been watching Friends since the third season and after I watched one episode, I was hooked. I immediately started recording all of the episodes and reading anything I could find about it. This show is one of the few exceptions of smart TV. It's funny but not to the point where it becomes silly.<br/><br/>Most if not all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious. When I watch Friends, I actually laugh out loud, which is unusual for me. Perhaps, the thing that I like best is that every week, two or three plots are running at the same time. Any other show, ONE plot is the main focus. Since the cast is made up of six characters, it calls for different situations and I love that. The most ordinary situations/dialogue/problems can be turned into something so complicated. And that's what makes it so funny.<br/><br/>Friends is a well written show that doesn't get out of control with its stupidity. At some times, the annoying laughter from the audience at the dumbest things makes me so mad. <br/><br/>The one downfall of the show is the constant change of wardrobe with the cast. (Specifically with the ladies.) I can't say that I've ever seen an outfit worn twice. <br/><br/>Even though the endless wear of dresses and khakis irritates me to no end, I still love the show because of its writing and terrific acting. In my opinion, nobody is worth $725,000 for 20 minutes, but thanks to the cast and crew for their creativity, I've learned to like today's TV. When this sitcom came out, it was original! It was funny! Oh, what a great show it WAS! But now, the writers have lost their grasp on the whole idea of originality. It seems the same kind of thing happens every episode! For example, there was hardly a single episode in the first season when Ross didn't mention his wife being a lesbian, which quickly got boring. Janice's character got so out of control, and when she was brought back we were very lucky that the writers decided to get rid of her very quickly.<br/><br/>Then, there's the much hyped London episode. How could anyone be so disappointed as me, a British person, when he finds that all the hype, plus the fact that many respected British actors were featuring, all this was for nothing! The episode had no funny parts, it was like the writers sat down, thought of a small plot, thought of the ending, and just sat down and wrote a boring, repetitive episode that started boring and ended boring!<br/><br/>All I'm saying, and I know a lot of people disagree with me, but a lot of people agree too, is that the show should stop while it's "ahead". The show should have stopped after season three, when it still had a molecule of dignity about it....sorry fans of Friends, but this show is toast! The best reason for explaining why I like "Friends" is that it is not just a very, very funny comedy, but also has an intelligent screenplay. Well... Many people may say 'If you want something intelligent, watch "Frasier" or "Seinfeld"' But I've already tried to watch them, and I just hated both - they're boring and unfunny, and so is "Ally McBeal".<br/><br/>This show is recommended for everyone who wants to laugh very much. The actors are great, specially Lisa Kudrow- one of the funniest actresses in Hollywood nowadays. She's really incredible!<br/><br/>So watch it and have great fun! (Fortunately the next season is coming next week to Brazil) How can people hype this series up so much? Its so boring and silly. Just pointless childish humour and annoying characters. The idea og having Friends could have been a good concept, but there is nothing fun about it. People who rate this show so high. Its bad. Grow up . Adults ain't this nice or friendly to each other ever . Friends was always basically a very lame, very unfunny version of Seinfeld aimed at shallow teenagers, people who found Seinfeld to "edgy", "intellectual" or "cold" and people who need a giant sized billboard announcing every joke, in order to get it.<br/><br/>The whole setup of the show (starting with the stupid couch in planted in the middle of the café which is apparently owned by the main characters of this sitcom and where no other customers are allowed to sit) is unnatural and far fetched. Every line from every actor in every episode feels fake and is obviously just there to set up the next lame joke that you can see coming from miles away. This renders the series utterly predictable, annoying and boring.<br/><br/>Friends has no natural flow, no surprises and no funny jokes. It doesn't help that many scenes and ideas in Friends are copied straight from Seinfeld - though presented here in a lame, sugary and extremely heavy handed way. Basically the Friends writer are spoon feeding you old Seinfeld jokes with all the interesting ideas, nuances and flavors taken out and substituted with a thick layer of sugar to make everything sickeningly sweet. 15 years after the show ended it still haunts tv stations on endless loop.<br/><br/>As a tween/teen I used to enjoy it but having been able to revisit it in my 30s I've realised just how irritating it is.<br/><br/>For a start, each episode is exactly the same, essentially. The story arc never really ventured far from one episode to the next - the only variables being whatever improbable circumstances surrounded them or the various guest stars.<br/><br/>In reality each of the characters is a loathsome person in their various ways. How anyone of them succeeded in their various pursuits is beyond me. The only silver lining is that the fact that various ones paired up in the end was factually accurate because they were insufferable to all but each other.<br/><br/>Please let this show die. A friend of mine told me years ago that he had a simple test when dating a girl. If she's into 'Frasier' then she's a keeper. If she's into 'Friends' then steer the **k away. Having tried to sit through a single episode of Friends for the umpteenth time I now know why.<br/><br/>I've yet to see 'The One That Actually Made Me Laugh'.<br/><br/>Overacted, juvenile, and shallow, Friends is probably only funny to people who still laugh at farts.<br/><br/>And to top it off none of the characters are likeable. They're either self centred, neurotic, air headed, manipulative, selfish douches, or a combination of the above who's default mode of communication is put-down-sarcasm.<br/><br/>'Friends' may be rated highly right now, but over the years I'm sure the ratings will gradually drop as new viewers see this show for the outdated embarassment that it is. Let's be blunt, friends is hardly the most challenging comedy out there or the most enthralling drama. The thing it has got going for it however is its ability to draw people in. It's essentially comfort TV. Watching it doesn't require any effort at all, you just sit back and enjoy. With the best comedies, the office for example, there's the idea that you have to work a little to get some of the jokes. You have to be able to extract the joke for the full effect. With friends they simply present it to you and you simply take it in, no thought or effort required. It's easy to relate to on some levels, but sometimes their problems are simply comedy situations rather than ones you would come across in life. The wit isn't groundbreaking but is reliable to keep you going without annoying you. While its neither the ideal comedy or ideal drama it is a perfect example of comfort TV. If you want to be challenged by your TV then go elsewhere, otherwise just settle in, switch off and enjoy. It's a very special thing when a television show can cross that line from being just another show, to appointment television. That's what happened here, about six twenty-somethings with exaggerated facial expressions and manic line-readings who live each other's adventures in Manhattan over a ten year period. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the first season, which contained standard sitcom annoyances. Such as HEAVY laughtrack usage after unfunny jokes and characters, who when a friend's date would show up, would all aline near the front door and lean on each other and say "hi" all at once. Ugh, this show will be axed after six episodes. <br/><br/>But with little competition on other networks in the 8:30 slot (and a hell of an attractive cast) this show dragged on through a whole season. Things finally perked up with an unrequited crush between two of the main characters, which culminated in a terrific cliffhanger. Then something happened in season two, and the writers just exploded. From then on out over the next five years, this show couldn't miss. Constant on-target jokes, a newly budding romance with a great pay-off, and one of the fastest paces of any sitcom ever. Instead of the usual two-story structure, a third sub-story was added which made the 22 minutes fly by each week. The executive producers names would come up, and literally every week, I'd cry out in frustration: "It's done already??". But after around season six, viewage dropped and the show went onto cruise control. It still made you laugh, but wasn't as flawless. Then amazingly (mostly due in part to 9/11 after effects of wanting to smile again) the ratings soared back to number 1 where they stayed till the show went off the air three years later. As far as performances go, the actors were all terrific choices. Aniston really evolved from the spoiled rich girl to a successful, career-minded professional. Cox's neurotic tendencies were played for good laughs, but weren't overdone, wisely. And she had a great softness and emotion to her many romantic moments over the run. Two characters however, remained in a realm of intolerance as a viewer. <br/><br/>The Phoebe character portrayed by Kudrow, was completely unrealistic in her quirkyness, and I think would not be accepted by anyone as a friend. This left her character undefined, as they focused mainly on her family background for most of the first five or six years, and never giving her a solid romance like the other characters. Then you had LeBlanc as the token dumb stud, a guy who constantly misconstrued information and bugged his eyes reveling in the joy of the prospect of living in a supermarket of eating a sandwich. He made you laugh but at times was too stupid for even TV. LeBlanc could be great in his serious moments, but that distracted from his lack of intelligence in other episodes. His would-be romance with Aniston's character was rightly abandoned as it just didn't play right.<br/><br/>This brings us to the most unbalanced character of them all, Ross, played by Schwimmer. In the beginning he was the most rounded character who was going through a divorce after being abandoned by his pregnant lesbian wife. Far-fetched sure, but at least he brought an authentic turmoil to his role. Plus his secret affection for Aniston's character made you really root for him. HOWEVER, by season six or seven, the writers had him do a complete 180 and turn increasingly unbearable with his wild outbursts and disturbing mood swings. The idiotic handling of his post-break up years with Aniston was infuriating. IT'S OVER, MOVE ON! Yet, the two characters always had to stare at each other dramatically when the other would start dating again. This followed by the most embarrassing episode where Schwimmer gets drunk and carries on like a woman upon finding out LeBlanc and Aniston have a thing going. "I'm fiiiiiine!" will go down in the annals along with "We were on a break!!" (which was classic). <br/><br/>For last I've saved Matthew Perry, who in my mind was the second coming of John Ritter. An expertly gifted physical actor, who patented his own uprorious line deliveries and facial reactions. He was the writers go to guy early on in the show---too much in fact. Chandler was just a walking punchline, trying way too hard. But in years following, they toned it down and turned him into one of the best TV characters I've ever seen. Not just standard jokes, but great inside references only some of us folks would get. Which made his dramatic moments shine even more, the few he had. Chandler Bing will be missed. The finale was a tremendous let-down, going in bland directions and really lacking an emotional conclusion. Nothing is really resolved as they lay on the guitars thick for a final fade out (on a door????). In summation, it was one of those shows I really don't see recreated again, with the type of snappy dialogue and lovable characters who you will watch into syndication infinity like other shows. Oh....my....God, TV "Friends" like these are hard to come by. Hasn't aged well at all Not very funny would not recommend It really got few great one liners. But that consist of only 5% of this show or even less.<br/><br/>So, yes I don't find this show funny.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean that I don't like sitcom. I like Seinfeld and rest are too old for me to watch.<br/><br/>Because of the Hype I thought that I would watch this show. And it would be Great.<br/><br/>But, it turn out to be horrible. <br/><br/>I didn't like Breaking Bad and Dexter. <br/><br/>And now this. <br/><br/>I think that I am running out of Hit shows.<br/><br/>Actors are all great in this show.<br/><br/>I guess that they all are not comedian. So, that i can shift my blame on writers. <br/><br/>But again, it was a hit show. <br/><br/>I Presume that people like boring or in case of Breaking Bad and Dexter (Very very slow) content. Why all the 10 * reviews. It has to be the unfunniest program I have ever watched. Childish annoying it's so 1 dimensional and stupid. I'm so glad to see loads of other 1* reviews which is exactly what it deserves First off, I don't ever rate a TV show 10/10, but for this show it was easy to give it such a high rating.The reason I became such a huge fan of the show is because my cousin suggested to me that I should just skip the first season. So I watched the pilot and just skipped to season 2, after that I binge-watched the entire thing. When I had finished I went back and watched the first season, and let me tell you, if I had only season the first season, I would have stopped watching after episode 3. It was SO bad, the comedy was forced and unfunny, the acting was terrible (leaving out Matthew Perry and David), and it was just boring. Not once did it make me laugh, which is what sitcoms are supposed to do. But the rest of the show was a master piece and to anyone out there who wants to know if the show's worth it, watch the pilot and just skip the rest of the season. It'll be worth it for sure. Many times I back away of writing about it. It brings the worst of me, and it doesn't deserve the time either. But let's do it anyway. So, simply why it is hatful, AND causes this huge amount of provocation also?!<br/><br/>_It got a more-than-enough-time on the TV. Actually, 10 years is a time record, and a proof of being pushed by the network deceitfully as the "best of the best"?? It's not about bad work, No, it's about bad work that had been propagandized as great. It could be the ultimate scheme where the sponsors or the advertisement's companies promoted it heavily and incessantly like that. And it's the urge to find any star-show, superiority's symbol, or any number one even forcedly, falsely, whatever. It's how to sell the so-so, or what's lower, as big, and make it sound brilliant. It reminds me when some movies' channel promoted (Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace - 1999), before airing it, as the highest grossing movie OF ALL TIME, while it's absolute garbage, and everybody knows about it. It's more like the top of the American box office holy list, where number one is one because it made half a million (and it ends up having only this half of million too!). Well, believe it or not, (You Got Served - 2004) was on the top of this list one day. So the lesson is: Don't believe the propaganda.<br/><br/>_The characters are ugly. When you have a comedy about nerds, morons, or idiots persons, so that's the definition of low, cheap, easy comedy for me. Here, I felt so many times that the dumb characters had been handled, and developed, dumbly too. Other shows got humans in it, though here they were the caricature yet of who? Of originally perfectly caricature! It's like a silly parody of silly cartoon. It even didn't reach to be the brainless amusing, or the light smiling time. It didn't get (Becker - 1998: 2004)'s plain deepness, neither the efforts of (Seinfeld - 1989: 1998)'s writing. GOD, it was hopelessly tasteless all along!<br/><br/>_Most of the cast is in one word: Unfunny. Save (Kudrow), there was a pretense of being laughable where "pretending" replaces nonexistent talent or risible charisma. Nearly all of them weren't innately droll. Nearly all of them were unbearable in other roles in cinema, especially the all-time-awful (Matthew Perry). I want to send him a message that says: please, making laughs is not about fallen down or goggling eyes only, and if you don't understand, search for another job to have mercy on yourself and us!<br/><br/>_Be ready for this: Every moron of this bunch at one step had ONE MILLION DOLLAR payment for every single episode of this nonsense. Highly provocative huh?!<br/><br/>_The chain of relationships in the show's drama! I was sick of cases like: sleep with me, slept with him, slept with her, sleeping with everybody!! And they're calling it Friends?! Well, at least not my kind of friends. And for its fans: wouldn't you feel wrong with that ever? I mean you never felt that these fellows' sexual behaviors were so exaggeratedly reckless?! Really, didn't anyone feel disgust out of this, or sense how that was too much sometimes, and not in a comic way?!! Anyhow, I couldn't stand those friends or this friendship. Maybe it's something the rich brats, more than the middle-class, can appreciate and love, or maybe it's something produced by the rich brats for the middle-class to appreciate and love!<br/><br/>_Now for something irritating yet doesn't belong to the show; it ran for a decade already, while - in the same time - some good shows with potential, and creative actors, weren't given the chance to continue properly. So you have to feel implied anger because of the long continuation of it, while other extremely better, shows got the "cancel" decision way early. Over and above, I think good shows like (Vengeance Unlimited - 1998: 1999) were canceled because it got in the way of (Friends)'s time on air. Ok, that's another reason to be angry!<br/><br/>_The fact of being on every channel, with non-stoppable reruns. It's naturally since it's a long one, with more than 200 episodes. However, think of it from my point of view; it's like running into your horrid ogre on TV everyday! Plus, it's truly a killer when you have other versions of it internationally, with some trash that nearly imitates it, and delivers its goods perhaps purely or excessively, like for horrible instance (That 70s Show - 1998: 2006)!<br/><br/>_I feel bad when shoddy, banal at its best, work like that, with no serious anything, or even a respectable comedy, has more than it merits. It's so underrated when it comes to evaluate its real position. I recall the saying "Not every great is famous, and not every famous is great". So, when you hear a dude saying: "It's the best show I saw in my whole life!" you must understand fine just 2 things: 1) Everybody's entitled to their own opinion. 2) This dude surely didn't watch many shows in his "whole life".. So, pity the fool!<br/><br/>At last, one of my friends told me: "Just take it as your daily cup of cappuccino". Well, I don't drink cappuccino! I'm starting by doing something like "Pookyiscute" and talk about each character individually, I'm doing it using no particular order:<br/><br/>Courtney Cox/Monica Geller-Bing:<br/><br/>The actress does a great job with Monica, as the show goes, you really start to believe she loves order, discipline and hates to lose. Her relationship with Chandler was also great, it might not have had the history that Ross and Rachel had, but it was still great. I really like her, her cleanliness, her bossiness, her cooking and her competitiveness. I can't finish talking about her without quoting her catchphrase: "I KNOW"<br/><br/>Here's a little scene from the show: After Rachel's birthday party, Rachel offered help to Monica for cleaning up to which Monica replies, "Are you kidding? You had your party, now I'll have mine!"<br/><br/>Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:<br/><br/>I like Joey a lot, he's funny and extremely protective with his friends (you can clearly tell that when Chandler and Monica move and Rachel goes to Paris). He might not be the smartest or the funniest, but he's definitely the most caring character in the show. I have to quote Pookyiscute here: "(...) his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time". That's just true. ;D He also plays Joey Tribbiani in the show "Joey", where he moved to L.A. to pursue his acting career. His sister Gina Tribbiani and her son Michael were two other central characters of the show.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green:<br/><br/>Jennifer is now the most famous actress on the show, but I don't think that's very fair... Don't get me wrong, I really like her as an actress, but I just don't like her as much as I like Matthew Perry. Rachel Green is clearly the character who changes the most from the beginning of the show, in the first episodes she was just a spoiled daddy's girl, then throughout all the episodes she evolved in many ways, she got a job, stopped being so superficial, I just think it's very admirable what she accomplished. Her history with Ross was also great, a lot of ups and downs but it ended well and it was worth it. :P<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow/Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan:<br/><br/>At first, I did't like Phoebe very much, because she was very naive and kinda dumb. But then, as the show went on, I started to appreciate her, because she is very sweet, very protective towards animals (she's a vegetarian), and has some great songs (Smelly Cat, for example). Her ingenuousness is just lovely, i think what also makes her different is her childhood and the fact that she lived on the streets for some time. Her connection with joey is just great (perhaps because they are the only two with less academic education).<br/><br/>David Schwimmer/Ross Geller:<br/><br/>I think that one of the reasons I like Ross so much is because he's the character who I relate the most. I think it's because he's very into science to him because he's very into science and I have a personality very similar to his. As I've said above, one of the thinks I liked the most was the Ross-Rachel relationship, that turned out fine, in spite of all the arguing and the "we were on a break!" situation. David Schwimmer, along with Matthew Perry are my favorites on the show, they're really great. <br/><br/>Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:<br/><br/>He's the best, he's really funny, no actor has made me laugh this much, and I think Matthew is also funny as a person, you can see that on the bloopers for example, the way he always jokes around with the other 5, and also because of his other works as an actor (I haven't seen all, but I'm working on it). He's simply great, the show wouldn't be the same without him, he's so talented! As Pookyiscute said: "They should have a shrine dedicated to this man." He's definitely my favorite, not only on the show, but in general.<br/><br/>In the final episode, right before the end: Rachel: "Ok, should we get some coffee?" Chandler: "Sure. -(pause: they go out the door)- Where?"<br/><br/>I used to see some episodes on TV, but then I started watching the DVD's from the first season and never stopped.<br/><br/>I just love the way they can make you really care about the characters, I saw the last episodes today, in the one before the last one they show scenes from all the other seasons, and it feels really good to remember all that. And when you're watching the last one, if you've watched all the other ones, you get really sad and happy at the same time, just like the characters do.<br/><br/>Every episode is extremely funny and entertaining, yet if you watch all the episodes you realize it's much more than comedy.<br/><br/>It's my favorite show, and I doubt I'm ever going to see another TV show half as good as this one.<br/><br/>I give this show a Perfect 10, only because there's nothing higher. It's incredible how "Friends" got better and better for 10 straight years. I admit I was sad when it finally came to an end, but it was a very well and respected end. The actors/actresses were able to bring their characters to life so well, I was able to feel their emotions, hilarious situations, and most importantly, their friendship. It's no wonder why this is my personal favorite show. I've had people ask "Who's your favorite character?" I was never able to answer that question and I probably never will be able to. Each character had their own unique personality that you can't help but love. Joey's "How you doin'?" Chandler's "Oh my God!" Monica's "OCD like" behavior, Ross and his divorces, Phoebe's naive nature, and Rachel's impeccable sense of fashion. It doesn't get better than this. I hope you all enjoy "Friends" as much as I did. Ever since I first saw Friends on the air in Argentina, where I used to live, I have been hooked. The first time we all saw Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler & Joey we see them in the coffeehouse (which throughout all seasons will become the most popular coffeehouse in the world) and they seem like regular new yorkers struggling in the world we know today. This show takes a funny twist to every-day life in the American style we all know and love.<br/><br/>If one would ask a person what their favorite TV show is, most answers would be "Friends" simply because this show relates to everyone's lives, not just Americans. You can be from all over the world (like I was) and still understand and relate to most of the situations the characters may be in, no matter how wacky it is.<br/><br/>This is a must-see show. It will bring so much humor into your life you will not want to miss it. Buy the DVDs as well, they are great! This is the best series I,ve ever watched, you watch it again and again and you know what the next sentence Ross will say and you can't move from your chair, I can't imagine how the 6 are combined as perfect as this, you can never imagine anyone out or replaced by any other actor, it is just...PERFECT, they are so real, so good, so funny, they make you laugh from the inside, all what you see are facts from life, you can't think that they are acting, as if you see real people, and as I believe always, Inspite of good actors/acting, good script, good story, good music, good directing, there is always a "SPIRIT" for every show, if this spirit is good, people will love the show, and Friends have this spirit, I just wish if it can return back, can it..??? There's not one sitcom that i can think about that even come close to Friends. Its full of entertainment and the characters are so developed. Fans naturally becomes attach to the characters..Monica nd Chandler are just the cutest things. Ross and Rachel always find its way back to each other. When the characters are sad..you can't help but be sad along with them. The writing of the show is ingenious and everything about it also. I would stay at home all day just to watch Friends. Friends give you an positive and negative side on how life can be with real friends that really care about you. Thats the best part. ITs real, its funny, its Friends forever. This is without doubt the most funniest thing that I have ever seen. I don't laugh often because not many things I find funny but Friends will really put a smile on your face. Every single episode makes me laugh at least 5 times. If there is a person out there that does not laugh through out every episode I think that they deserve a medal of honor for it. It is impossible to show a straight face when you are watching this. At first they were all people that new nothing about each other but now that their friendships are strong. It makes it even better! This I would recommend to everyone in the world and I would like to see them make more of friends. I've seen almost all of the episodes of Friends and I have to say that it's one of the best shows ever-hands down! This show follows the lives of 6 young, single people living in New York and it shows their highs, their lows and every thing else from dates to vacations that has happened and what is happening to them. It's an extremely funny show guaranteed to give you a laugh what ever mood you're in. Even though it's almost the last episode, it's definitely worth watching. Monica is played by Courteny Cox, Rachel is played by Jeniffer Aniston, Phoebe is played by Lisa Kudrow, Joey is played by Matt Le Blanc, Ross is played by David Schwimmer and Chandler is played by Mattew Perry. These 6 wonderful actors and actresses are what make the program what it is today along with the great writting and the hilarious story line.<br/><br/>By R. K. Green Friends is the best show ever!  I am so sad that it is ending this year. This show makes me laugh, and it is very funny!  The first time I watched this show, I knew it would be good.  Friends is very well written, the creators of the show are great, and it has a such talented cast!  Joey is the best character on Friends! For those of you who think this show sucks, I totally disagree! I don't think Friends is the worst show on TV right now, but it is the most over-rated. There is no real plot whatsoever. They use the same storylines over and over again. The writing is pretty stupid. The acting is terrible. The characters are all shallow, whiny, pathetic, sex-crazed losers. The show in general is just not good. The only saving grace on this show is Matthew Perry. I suggest you to change the laugh voice and replace it with fart tones Out of all the stupid shows that are on anymore, this is the one I HATE the most. This has to be the MOST overated show of all time. The plots on each episode are stupid, and the characters are stupid too. "Friends" all together is a terrible show. And of course, it's on NBC the home of many other overated shows (like "Frasier", and "Will & Grace"). NBC should rename itself OPBC The Overated Programming Broadcast Network since it has this, and many other overated shows.<br/><br/>This gets no stars, and why should it? Cause it SUCKS!!! How can u watch this with all those laughing noises????? i actually got crazy at the first episode! The sitcom equivalent of elevator music. The perfect show to run in the background when you have to do some work around the house and dont want to feel lonely. Not nearly as annoying as say How i met your mother but not as funny as....well I dont know any sitcoms that are funny actually After watching every episode of this much-appreciated-and-loved-by-all sitcom, I'd have to say that this is not just a show. All six characters brings the humor, love, drama which makes viewers to like them even more.<br/><br/>Here's my view on each of the six characters-<br/><br/>Chandler Bing: Star player of the show. If nothing/no one can make you laugh, he will. His sarcastic dialogues make you love him more.<br/><br/>Ross Geller: A geek, who easily gets dates more often<br/><br/>Joey Tribbiani: He's character is dumb but still makes you giggle. He's the adorably stupid on the show.<br/><br/>Phobe Buffay: A weirdo, but cares a lot her friends, give them best possible advice and laugh at them on every occassion.<br/><br/>Monica Geller: I don't get her character so won't say anything.<br/><br/>Rachel Green: Worst character on the show. "I'll be there for youÂ…" started the song for introducing the six people who sat on an orange couch talking about their lives and wondering about their future, cracking jokes and above all as the song suggests being there for one another during tough times. The greatness that the show achieved would have been talked by many bloggers, critics and fans. So what's new about the show which is on the way to reach its 23rd birthday?<br/><br/>It is the first show I watched and at that time I was clueless about my future (still am) just like Rachel when she walked into the coffee shop in the episode 'It all began'. As the episodes progressed and the seasons progressed they taught me how to be a good companion, a better person and a best friend. Each one of their character had their unique style of acting with their own punch lines, story arcs, flashbacks (Monica's fat suit, Rachel's nose etc.) and individual's success like Ross's tenure or Joey's acting career. These six people showed the true meaning to the word 'Friends'.<br/><br/>paul96.org/F.R.I.E.N.D.S-The Trendsetter<br/><br/>paul96.org/CHANDLER BING-The King Of Sarcasm<br/><br/>paul96.org/MONICA GELLER/BING-The Compulsive Cook<br/><br/>paul96.org/ROSS GELLER-A Prowess Palaeontologist<br/><br/>paul96.org/RACHEL GREEN-A Fanatic Fashioner<br/><br/>paul96.org/JOEY TRIBBIANI-The Sensational Stud<br/><br/>paul96.org/PHOEBE BUFFAY-An Idiosyncratic Lassie<br/><br/>paul96.org/F.R.I.E.N.D.S-The Best Episodes Friends is a phenomenal television show about six friends sharing their lives together in an apartment. The big Apple never looked more glamorous or petite then here as they find romance, job offers and try to be retro while shouting out witty jokes along the way.<br/><br/>The caste seemed to comfortable around each other and seemed to have a great time. Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) and Courney Cox (Monica Geller) are truly hilarious every time they appear bringing sincerity and good nature fun to the roles. The rest aren't bad but I can see why their careers have gone the direction of made for TV movie's or dimmed to none. <br/><br/>Now that Nick@night has picked it up I've caught up to all the misadventures and trials they've gone through making it apart of my life. I was sad to see it end with no new tales to entertain and delight or moments to awe in its clever writing. But at least reruns are still in play to relive all the magic once more.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the show give it awhile to pick up on recurring gags and wacky fun to be had until your addicted. Its a ten for ten in my book. Even though I have never seen Friends when it came out on the year I was born and until it was finished in 2004, I just still think its a very entertaining show. I only got seeing the episodes because of the continuous repeats on Comedy Central or other Television channels. <br/><br/>The cast are just the best, I love the fact they got Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer as the main cast. They are just such great comedy actors and they honestly don't need to be comedians to laugh at ones jokes! <br/><br/>I even love the soundtrack, its catchy, fresh and just happy! That definitely is a number one thing you need to get away from reality = a good upbeat song! <br/><br/>Regardless if this isn't really a favorite television show of mine, it was a pretty good TV series! I started to watch this series after 10 years which had been last air casted. My friends suggested me to watch this. I thought first it was creepy .But after a while i got entertained. There was so much fun in watching this series. There was nothing to say bad... It is totally good. There is so much with Joey... I laughed maniacally because of him and Chandler...Which i like him the most...In the last one i was very emotional...Overall the series was really good... It lasts for 10 years..I am a fan of Joey..... and i used to like Chandler and Rachel too...But i hated Pheobe for her creepy behavior.. I want this to continue air cast new episodes..... It has been more than 10 years since Friends aired its series finale. But till date, there has not been a better TV show created. It is only because the six lead characters of FRIENDS are so adorable and lovable. One literally cannot single out a single favorite character. When your mood is down, all you have to do is watch a random FRIENDS episode to cheer yourself up. My personal favorite character would be Monica Geller as she is probably the warmest and most affable among the six lead characters. The only flaw in the show would probably be the fact that Joey never gets married till the end of the series. Maybe that is why they created a spin-off series in his name It is the best show ever. It is funny, it is classy, it has drama, it has romance, it has love and more importantly it has sarcasm by Chandler. I have watched the whole series a couple of times and once you watch it you cannot get enough of it. It is really that great. i would love to see a movie of F.r.i.e.n.d.s. It is the best show ever.

I have watched the whole series a couple of times and once you watch it you cannot get enough of it. It is really that great. i would love to see a movie of F.r.i.e.n.d.s. I cannot put into words how AMAZING this show is. Never have I felt a certain way just by thinking about a TV show until I started Friends. The best show to ever exist. It never gets old. It is impossible to dislike this TV show. I never have written a review on this website but this show is way too OUT OF THIS WORLD to not give attention to it. It's a very very very excellent show and could not be better. The casting is amazing. Phoebe is my favorite, but they are all my favorite when I think about it. The plot is amazing in each episode. NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS TELEVISION SHOW. The absolute best thing to ever exist on TV and I have no regrets saying it is the best show of all time. This is the "benchmark" for comedy. Everything is "perfect" here the script, the acting and the actors. Mathew Perry, David Schwimmer, Matt Leblanc, Jennifer Aniston, Courteny Cox and Lisa Kudrow all six form one hell of a team. It is one of the greatest ensemble of pure talent ever. Every presented a unique set of comedy. This is the "benchmark" for comedy. Everything is "perfect" here the script, the acting and the actors. Mathew Perry, David Schwimmer, Matt Leblanc, Jennifer Aniston, Courteny Cox and Lisa Kudrow all six form one hell of a team. It is one of the greatest ensemble of pure talent ever. Every presented a unique set of comedy. It took me so long to finally start watching Friends. Great friends of mine were always saying how great this show was, and they were all talking about those little internal jokes from the series. Well, the first three seasons were not that great for many people, but I was already addicted. From the sixth till the last one, I almost couldn't stop watching it because they are the funniest and you start to care like you know them in person.<br/><br/>They've been through a lot during all those years, and sometimes their reaction to daily situations fits perfectly with your life. Not rarely I caught myself laughing alone from Chandler lines that were so appropriate for some situations. Anyway, I don't regret watching it, at all. Friends is one of my all-time favourite shows. I feel it is one of the best shows of it's genre, along with The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. It seems to have inspired many modern sitcoms, most notably How I Met Your Mother, which also is about a group of friends living in Manhattan.<br/><br/>Friends will make you both laugh and cry at the same time with it's well- written scripts and brilliant performances from it's main cast. It is a timeless show that will never be forgotten by anyone who has seen it. I feel that it is worth watching every episode of Friends, from it's unforgettable pilot to it's emotional finale. You will love every "friend" in the show after 3 episodes...or maybe even less. I always thought the guys were funnier than the girls but everybody has a different opinion. My favourite "friend" was always either Chandler or Joey, but both of them together are almost always the funniest scenes in the show, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I love Friends!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>10/10 Thanks to my friends who introduced me to this show. I watch way too much of this show. It is so wonderful that it relieves me from all the stress, I got so connected to the characters that I cry each time I watch final episode(I bet it happens to most of them who love this amazing series).It is so realistic that we( my gang) quote some or the other thing from friends almost on a daily basis. It is a master piece and every character was amazing..chandler,Monica,Rachel,Ross,joey,phoebe..they became so close to us that..we identify ourselves with those characters most of the time.. I watched this serial at least 4 times. I have friends still watching this serial. It is one of the best serial with which you can start your day with a smile on your face or finish an awful day again with the smile on your face. During 10 years they have done a really good job and they could keep doing for next 10 years. It is very good to see that sometimes we have good serials to watch and not losing time. We have to learn something from it and to have a positive attitude. once you will see 1 episode, it will convince you to continue. I have seen it during 1 week, day and night :) and I would do it again and live it again because i spend wonderful time watching. Good job! The greatest show ever! Even though the show was over in 2004, there is still the friends spirit going on in 2014. The acting was high level, I actually felt that I lost my friends when the show ended, it was one of the saddest moments, cried for days... My fav character is Phoebe, and for me the best actress. I really hope that they will get back together and film Friends2. Can't wait for that day, the second best day of my life!!! (the first was the day that I started watching the show) I will always stay the biggest fan of Friends, peace!!!!! Ps: If you haven't watched F.R.I.E.N.D.S yet, you are not living my fellow friend. Stop watching other shows, and start watching friends, I promise you it will be the turning point of your life. I loved it! This series are supposed to be longer than 10 seasons. I got the complete set of DVD on 13 Dec 2010. Just few minutes back,i completed all 10 seasons. <br/><br/>F.R.I.E.N.D.S = An actor(BRILLIANT) & Dating machine + Comedian(good friend) + Doctor(not really,but terrible keyboard player) + Perfectionist( chef + actually adviser + Molding people) + Singer & Masseuse(but terrible guitarist) + (Waitress + Fashion(adviser)) This formula really worked.<br/><br/>Friendship between Joey and chandler is the best in this series. <br/><br/>Past 20 days,i was laughing like something. Going to watch this series again n again:) It's never too late,if you haven't seen this series. Just go and buy a copy of DVD and enjoy! <br/><br/>Thanks a lot to JOEY(MATT),Chandler(MATT), Ross(David),Monica(Courtney), Phoebe(Lisa), Rachel(Jenifer), Writer, Director & Producer for keeping us smile :) And Making me cry (Because of the reason - why they stopped at season 10 when they got everything from this show) Friends is absolutely the best show ever aired on television. I didn't get to see the first episodes shown, as I was born in 1993, but I remember sitting with my parents to watch them, even if I didn't understand the jokes. Of course, today I bought the first season, which I really love. I've also got the ninth season (big difference) which is good, but I still love the first season best.<br/><br/>Friends is a funny and intelligent show that describes the lives of 6 individuals. Ever character can be loved in their own way. They are all different and lovable.<br/><br/>My favorite is Chandler Bing, because of his sarcastic and humoristic comments. He is adorable! Of course, I love all of them, but he still is my favorite.<br/><br/>In all, Friends is the best show ever. 'Friends' is a TV executive's dream programme. It has so many episodes - 236 - that they can repeat it in an endless cycle, knowing that by the time the last ever episode is re-shown, viewers will be ready to watch the first all over again. It has become so awesomely popular that there will, at least in the foreseeable future, always be a solid fanbase, who will revel in its plasticy, gimmick-ridden world. It offers a portrait of the world that neatly correlates to an executive's own view, one in which people conform to stereotype, never think an original thought, never perform an original action, and one which safeguards against any criticisms. There's the ethnic stereotypes to appease any 'watchdogs' - the Jewish Ross and Monica; the Italian-American Joey; the ditzy, arty Phoebe; the career-minded Rachel; and the laddish Chandler. It conforms with the tedious clichés of the neurotic Jewish characters (is there a 'dysfunctional and panicky' Jewish gene?), the Italian with the enormous family (because, hey, those Catholics can really pop 'em out!), and the idea that the underachiever must always be tamed by a bossy woman. You could argue these stereotypes, like all stereotypes, have a basis in reality, but when we've seen them a million times before, do we really need to reinforce them again? Everybody seems terribly nice and sweet-natured, and you'd love to have these guys as your neighbours, if they weren't quite so bland or dull. 'Friends' is set in a universe that resembles our own, but with all the rough edges smoothed down. It's where everything, no matter how hard anyone else tries to the contrary, ends up in the same place: a boring, mushy Hallmark Valentine's Day card version of Hell. It oozes cynicism like a weeping sore. It tries so hard to be everyone's favourite show, that in the scrabble to reduce its live audience to hyenas, it frequently falls short of coming up with anything remotely funny or even interesting. Just as The Rembrandts only had one hit with the insipid theme tune, so 'Friends' only has one joke: people do wacky things. Only they're not really wacky so much as irritating; they're not 'kooky,' they're just eminently slappable. It's like a Disney version of 'Sex & the City,' where all the characters are superficial, vacuous and obnoxious in their own different, variously unpleasant ways. That said, Phoebe is the only one who comes across as likable, and Lisa Kudrow produces a good bit of empathy from a trite character. In fact, I don't think it's the actors' fault as such - we've seen them in other vehicles and, apart from Matt LeBlanc, they have shown themselves to quite talented. It's more the bland writing, the aversion to creating anything new or maybe, just maybe, exploding some clichés. But of course, it is just a sitcom, aimed largely at a young audience, which is perhaps why all six characters act like petulant eight year olds. But for a show that claims to reflect true friendship, it never portrays the real ups-and-downs of being friends with people; it's a sanitised, very boring version of friendship, where everyone is exactly the same. Nobody smokes regularly, nobody drinks heavily or takes drugs. None of them seem to have the hang-ups, the disappointments or indeed, the wonderful pipe-dreams that most real people do have. Their friendship seems to be on the condition that they speak, look and behave in a certain way. It's a bit like Disneyland, in that you can enter into it and enjoy yourself, but only if you forget that it's not just entirely fake and superficial, but that it's always governed by strict and unforgiving rules - that really seem like an inverted version of real friendship. 'Friends' is the show for the type of person who would like to deny that bad things do happen to good people, and no matter how sweet and nice you are, there's always a negative to balance the positive. But it's TV, and of course it's fantasy, but it makes for a very boring, ultimately sad fantasy, one without any drama or real excitement. Either that, or 'Friends' is a masterful satire on the banality and vacuity of modern life. there are no words to describe how this series made an impact on my life! oh my god as janice would cry. the last episode was, by far, the best episode the gang have ever made. i have heard that the sitcom that changed a thousand lives fizzled out with a whimper, but it was far from it for us true fans. the sitcom will forever remain in our hearts as will the characters. sure, the characters were unrealistically funny and got into unbelievable predicaments, but was that not the attraction of the show? the "will-they-won't-they" saga of ross and rachel dominated a decade of laughter and tears over at central perk, and it will be sorely missed. thank goodness for the never ending repeats and the merchandise the production team have worked out over the years, because this way, friends will never really end. Friends, next to Gemini Man was one of the funniest shows on television during the 1980's. I first started watching it when it was in it's fourth season when I was in my last year of grade school. I was hooked, and eventually my older brother started watching it with me, and he liked it as much as I did! When they showed the reruns back then, I watched those, too.<br/><br/>Dan and Bull are my favorites. I love Dan's sarcasm, but never liked his perversion too much, and I love Bull's stupidity! Judge Harry Stone, Christine, and all the others on this show were all cool characters in their own unique way. Too bad sitcoms nowadays can't be as funny as Friends was!<br/><br/>Whenever I get the chance, I like to watch the reruns of it on A&E. The show just got better with every episode they showed, and every funny situation Harry and the gang would get into. This show is worth watching. If you've never heard of it, feel free to watch the reruns now being shown on A&E!! :) To say that Friends is a great show is an understatement. Friends is one among very few shows that has that "quality". That special "quality" that blends great acting, comedy, and season after season of great story-lines. I myself did not starting watching Friends until one day I caught it in re-runs about five or six years ago, and I was instantly hooked. It didn't take me long to catch up with the other seasons. I started watching the re-runs everyday, and I couldn't get enough of it. I then asked myself, why haven't I ever watched this great show before? I grew to love almost every character, and was excited every time a new episode came on. So after ten successful seasons, Friends is coming to an end. It's kinda bittersweet. Because as much as I want it not to end, I know that the actors have been playing the same characters for ten years and want to move on. I know, like me, millions of people will be tuning into the series finale in May, with their fingers crossed, praying that Ross and Racheal will end up together, and that all the characters will end up happy in their lives.<br/><br/>If your sad that friends is ending, take comfort in the fact that re-runs air everyday on TV,on several channels, and all those awesome seasons that have been released or are coming out soon on DVD. So I guess we don't really have to say goodbye to our Friends just yet. This has to be one of the worse comedies around, drab acting, I find the characters boring.. In my eyes one of the worst comedies out there still on the air.. I, myself, can count all the episodes that made me laugh on one hand.. BUT, before i get lynched, other people are loving it, maybe I am missing something, but I do still feel this way.. Think i will turn off the tv when it comes on next.. Bye. The only thing i have to say about this show is that it just isn't funny! None of the characters are likeable, and not once have I seen an African-American, Chinese, or Hispanic person on the show. Why set it in New York if you aren't going to take advantages of the unique opportunities it offers, such as amazing multiculturalism? Being in the primary demographic for this show (a fifteen year old girl,) my friends have subjected me to countless episodes. If you are looking for intelligent comedy try watching Frasier, if you want your brain to melt into silly putty then watch an episode of Friends. I really love this show. It's warm, witty, romantic, and so damn hilarious! Last season slipped a tad, but in the show's 8th season, it came alive again! My favorite female "friend" is definately Rachel (Jennifer Aniston.) Some of the stuff she gets herself into in so funny. She's also HOT. My favorite male "friend" is probably Joey(Matt LeBlanc). He's dumb, but in a funny way. I also love Pheobe (Lisa Kudrow) and Chandler (Matthew Perry.) Pheobe is so ditzy, but she's also the most insightful of the group. Chandler is the hilarious wise ass. Whenever Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Ross (David Schwimmer)have one of their brother sister fights, it's always a treat. I love this show! Friends is one of the best shows I've seen, first, the writing is top notch, the dialogues are smart, sophisticated and very snappy, second, the cast is wonderful and has a flawless chemistry and play each other very well, all of them play their roles perfectly, the show is hilarious, one of the funniest I've seen, it's totally one of the best sitcoms of all time, I put it up there with Cheers, Seinfeld and The Cosby Show, the storylines are great, the show dares deals with lots of stuff and in the funniest way like careers, sex, relationships, life, etc., this show should win an Emmy for Best Comedy, it's a joy to watch and it's very entertainment, one of the few sitcoms that is actually funny, a great show, totally recommend it. Thanks to shows like Cheers and Seinfeld which raised the standard of sit-coms, as a result we're lucky to be able to watch fine writing and acting on prime-time TV. And Friends is one of the nicest to come along. One thing I like about this show, and they're not the first ones to do it, I know, is to have a lot of famous people making appearances on the show, everybody from Arnold Schwartzenegger to Sarah, the Duchess of York.  It just makes for a nice surprise to see those familiar faces and plus having occasional appearances by all-time favorites like Elliott Gould, Christina Pickles and Teri Garr are always enjoyable. This is the funniest show I have ever seen in my life. Every single time I watch this my face gets all red from the laughing. My favorite character is Chandler.....but I have to admit that he should lose some pounds. He's not as funny as he was in like 97,98,99, he used to thin, extremly funny, and sooo cute! But *sigh* he has gained some weight. I usually don't like to be mean about shows or movies, I'm pretty much ok with the idea that everybody likes different stuff, live and let live. However, when I feel that there has been serious misjustice done in the world of comedy/humor, I can't stay silent. The very reputation of the words "funny", "comedy", "humor", and "hilarious" has been irreparably damaged by shows like this. There are many shows, presently and in the past, that have done this, but they were usually very easily identified and correctly put in their place in the ol' 'sub-par' category. However, after seeing the rating this show has received, I felt it was my duty to dispel the ridiculous rating of 8.9 (as of 2/17/19) and one should not be deceived by such numbers.<br/><br/>Ok, 'Friends': This is a show for people with a bland, generic, tame, underdeveloped and/or a non-existent sense of humor who want to feel like they're normal people that have a good sense of humor. But alas, it may be genetic, or it may be environmental, but there is simply a large segment of the population that are incapable of distinguising what is genuinely funny. It's not their fault. They can't change. It's too late. But we don't want to make them sad, or feel left out, so that's the reason shows like this one are created.<br/><br/>This show labels itself a sitcom, but it seems that it couldn't make up its mind on whether to be a sitcom, a dramedy, or a soap opera for teenagers/early 20-somethings. But I understand why it has this identity crisis. If you're catering to the audience I described in the previous paragraph, you know that, because of their underdeveloped sense of humor, they would not be able to keep their attention on the show if it was more strictly comedy/humor-driven with maybe a drop of drama/sentimentality here and there (think along the lines of 'The King of Queens'), so big batches of non-comedy time needed to be dumped into to 'Friends'. The range of humor these people get is so limited that the show couldn't expect to fill more than 10 minutes of comedy, and they had to keep them tuned in for the whole 22 minutes of airtime, so this is where the terrible (or "amazing" to Friends fans) filler came in.<br/><br/>If you think all that sounds appealing, or you know you're in the demographic of being humor-deficient, then by all means, watch 'Friends', you will love and enjoy it. There's nothing wrong with that, that's what it's there for, people like youself. But to those reading this that like to laugh at things that are actually funny, and enjoy the many facets and types of comedy in the world, I urge you not to watch this show, as chunks of your sense of humor may wither and die if subjected to 'Friends' in any amount.<br/><br/>FYI: I don't like to rate things 1 star, because it kinda makes me feel sad. So I had to come up with reasons to give this tv show 2 starts. The reasons I came up with are, as follows:
1.) Courteney Cox gets a lot of cool points in my book because she was in Bruce Springsteen's video for 'Dancing In The Dark'. And she's hot.
2.) Lisa Kudrow was in an episode of a truly funny show ('Cheers') and she had black hair in it and she was sexy with black hair.
Ok, 2 stars justified now. Goodbye. I don't know why millions of people say that this is the best sitcom ever. I've repeatedly tried to get into it, but just can't. I only laugh slightly a couple of times per episode.<br/><br/>The main six characters are a bunch of ordinary narcissists (with the possible exception of Phoebe). How is the audience supposed to like them or care about them?<br/><br/>It's ridiculously unbelievable that Ross (a funny-looking, old- acting geek with an annoying voice) gets several hot girls. <br/><br/>Many fans have said of Friends that all young adults are similar to one of the main characters. I've never been similar to any of them - nor are any of the people whom I personally know.<br/><br/>I don't understand Rachel having been revered and admired as a sex symbol. She isn't glamorous, doesn't have a seductive voice or sexy personality and isn't particularly good-looking. <br/><br/>I've seen many sitcoms which are much better than Friends, including Coupling (the original UK series, not the dreadful US remake). Coupling is a much funnier, sexier and more intelligent version of Friends. Coupling is better-written, better-acted and has much stronger and diverse characters. <br/><br/>Friends is a mediocre sitcom full of ordinary people who are rarely entertaining. I guess that all of the people who dislike my review haven't seen any episodes of Coupling. This show should be pulled off the air. Disgusting. What to say about this show.<br/><br/>Must be made for the brain dead out there. <br/><br/>5th grade humor at best. You can watch tune Disney or Nick for equal humor, but that is geared towards kids so understandable.<br/><br/>Surly anyone with any brains can't find this show enjoyable.<br/><br/>At work people watch it in the lunch room. I can guess the punch line while the sentence is still being uttered, and know it is going to be stupid. <br/><br/>I have had to either 1) not go in the lunch room or 2) Get the remote and refuse to tune in "friends". It has created enemies but I don't care, at least I still have my sanity.<br/><br/>The laugh track is even turned way up in volume. Ok so first off, before anyone hates on me. Tell me, didnt we all know Rachel was going to end up with Ross? Come on, we all knew it from the first episode.
Anyway. So FRIENDS, the most overrated show according to me. Everywhere I go people keep hyping over it and I just dont get it. So many shows are overshadowed by Friends. Friends is good, but not great. Predictable story, humor is bad, like how is it even a comedy? I barely laughed, and to top it all off, I couldnt relate to any of the characters, which ultimately leads to no emotional connect. Sure I loved Chandler, but come on do we seriously have friends like Phoebe or Joey?
There were episodes where I was trying to stay awake.
To conclude it all: Overrated, predictable, NOT FUNNY. With respect to the other GREAT shows out there how can people give 8.9. This was the first TV show I watched and I have to admit I really liked it but after watching The office, trailer park boys, its always sunny etc This show looks like a soap opera with forced laughter. I like Phoebe. I like her cheeriness and eccentricities.<br/><br/>I found a lot of the writing to be pretty bad.<br/><br/>That's why I find it overrated. Now for some personal points: This show's particular brand of humor is not my taste. Because of this, I don't like Rachel or Monica. I can't overlook how Monica is an arrogant control-freak and that Rachel can't admit when she's wrong and she blames things on others.<br/><br/>The videotape! Rachel came onto Ross and she knows she did! But nope! She thought she could fool everyone into think Ross came onto her. And when it was proven otherwise I was like, "Yeah! Take that Rachel, you liar!"<br/><br/>They were on a break! She wanted Ross to take responsibility for everything that went wrong between her and him! Yeah, not everything was his fault. ('If you take responsibility I can begin to trust you again.' Seriously, Rachel?) Same goes for the drunken marriage and the annulment fiasco that followed it. ('Look what you've done with your funny, funny form!'-'Me? What about you and your consummate like bunnies...' Now that I type that I realize it was entirely her fault they couldn't get an annulment! And I don't care if she was angry. What she did was childish and stupid! Also, on the form it said Ross was addicted to heroine. Okay, a judge read that out loud. Wouldn't she call the cops or something?) Sorry, went on a tangent. Duh, right? Lol. Whilst appreciating there are many fans, I have tried to watch Friends several times since it started and has been repeated. Ten minutes has been the maximum before I turn off. I suspect thats if you like more thoughtful comedy like Frasier, early Big Bang or Parks and Recreation then Friends may not be to your taste. Friends is funny but vastly overrated. ------------------------------ The show cotton candy for your brain, you don't feel emotions when watching friends... You just sit, and laugh at the silly jokes that aren't often that good. The characters are average at best and arguably there's only two funny characters. It's a pity that this overrated TV series is above Suits, Mad Men, Archer, and South Park, and shares a list with Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and House of Cards. Friends being so highly rated on IMDb kind of makes me loose hope in humanity. It's completely fine if you watch this and you enjoy it, but don't rate it as highly as other TV masterpieces. If anyone were to ask me what are the hallmarks of a good friend, I would have only the following answer. He or she must be as cute as Rachel, as homely as Monica, as quirky as Phoebe, as geeky as Ross, as wisecracking as Chandler and as crazy and lovable as Joey. Friends changed my life forever. The title track, "I'll be there for you" says it all, the essence of a true friendship, being there when you're needed the most, caring, when you didn't really have to, being loved and cared for and having someone, who'll give you a true perspective on life, who'll side by you, no matter what. Friends brought light in my life, it taught me truly, how life should be lived. Long live the good old friends! For a comedy, they added way too much drama, nor was the comedic elements really funny. All the characters just acted like nimrods and talk funny because apparently subtlety isn't amusing to a lot of people. Also, I found it so predictable (wow, Rachel and Ross wound up together. What a freaking surprise) and abusively cliché (how many weddings and babies can one show have?!). To make matters worse, the spin-off is going to be based around the worst of the six - Joey. Ugh! Overrated and over-hyped are words too good to describe this show. <br/><br/>But then again, with the exception of a select few, I think all sitcoms are rubbish. <br/><br/>I also want to say this beats Charmed because Charmed truly sucks, and I don't understand why it's adored like it is. A Buffy rip-off but without the wit, intelligent themes, allegories, and accurate study of human nature (there appears to be no grey area on Charmed as far as I've seen). By far the greatest show ever made by mankind. Millions of people have been watching the lives of these 6 friends for ten years. Classic quotes, scenes and episodes have made us laugh and cry during these ten successful years. I buy every season on DVD the second it comes out. Chandler is my favorite out of the guys and Rachel is my favorite out of the girls. But "Friends" wouldn't be "Friends" without them together. The end is near but "Friends" will always be with us forever. I will never get sick of this classic show. This show shows brilliance in many shapes and forms. Genius writing and acting is what really makes this show what it is. "Friends" is a classic show that I will always watch. It is worth one watch but nothing more. It does not even begin compare with shows like Seinfeld. Some of the jokes are good but is too melodramatic in my opinion. It is too sentimental for my liking. Acting is also average. Characters are good. Again some of the plots are too melodramatic and unreal. One or two seasons are good, rest are pretty average. Some of the last seasons are boring and too high on emotional content. You feel like watching some soap opera. One of the good things about it is that you can really associate with the characters. It has a diverse set of characters as well. <br/><br/>In a few words don't expect too much. Dated, dumb, not believable, etc. etc. Overhyped. Not worth yer time, these '20 somethings' (two of which were in their 30s when it started-Courtney Cox and Kudrow) supposedly struggle to have jobs and make it but looking at the way they dress, where they live, etc...c'mon guys. At least Try to make them Look lower middle class. I don't think I have ever seen a show that was more overhyped and less worth watching than this or Seinfeld. If the laugh track wasn't there to tell you when to laugh, it wouldn't have lasted long. The awful campy acting is worst than anything I've seen. If I could give this show a negative I would give it -10/10. Never was a fan... but watched a few episodes! Now, they are repeating it on TV so i decided to watch from the beginning! Just saw 2 episodes and... is so dumb and stupid! Don´t get what people see in this to give it a score of 10!? How can IMDB score 8,9... the same score they gave to the masterpiece and for sure the best sitcom ever, Seinfeld! This is on of my favorite series together with Spin City, Will & Grace and Ally McBeal. I don't know why I like it so much. The humor is great and the characters very funny but I think it has to do with the whole atmosphere. In the beginning of the series, with a group of 6, I had the same kind of group. May be this helps to like the series more.<br/><br/>Anyway, it is very funny and even in the ninth season it still has some original things. Check it out. The silliest show of the 90s, despite NBC's desperate attempt to plug it as part of the 'must see TV' lineup. A flaky plot about six idiots who seem to have nothing of substance, let alone funny to say. A combination of an airhead (Phoebe), a neurotic (Rachel), morons (Ross, Chandler & Joey) and a bore (Monica) make up one of the flakiest shows to have graced the TV screen. Our only hope is the salary hike the cast has demanded will make the producers realize continuing the show ain't worth it. Recently I was reading reviews about the the show "How I met your mother" and about 80 % of the reviewers who didn't like HIMYM were comparing with Friends: some writing that HIMYM was a copy of Friends, some writing that Friends was 100 times better,etc.Friends and HIMYM are two different shows.
Fruiends is a linear story,while HIMYM is a more complicated line of story with a lot of flashbacks.
I have enjoyed some episodes of Friends and specially when other actors o actresses were playing a role (Bruce Willis, Tom Selleck, Isabella Rossinnelli for example), but also some other episodes were boring.
Also some reviewwers mention that the team of Friends wanted to surpass the record of Steinfeld (another quite different comedy) and therefore the episodes became repetitive and boring !! I've been a fan of Friends since it first ran on TV.
I had most of it on VHS, then got the DVD-box, and now just a week ago the Bluray-box.<br/><br/>I've been watching it from the start, aiming to go through the whole series again. It's probably been a decade and a half since I saw it last.
I love this show, I really do.
There are a few episodes that feel kind of throwaway, but most are solid entertainment, and quite a few are really - REALLY - good!
My absolute favourite character is Chandler, but Joey and Phoebe aren't far behind.
Monica is kind of a 50/50 thing for me...<br/><br/>But Ross and Rachel, sadly, are what keeps this show from being a 10 for me. Ross is an annoying moper at first, then rolls over into obsessed and creepy, and somewhere right before the end of the series (where they try to take him back to "normal", but it's too late) he just seem like a mentally disturbed sociopath.
Combine this with his weird love for Rachel, the most manipulative and psychpathically indecisive sitcom character ever, and the two of them keep Friends from top spot.<br/><br/>I still love the show, and I'll still watch it every now and again. But if I can I'll skip over the Ross&Rachel heavy episodes.<br/><br/>Word of warning for anyone thinking of buying this on dvd - DON'T!
The remastering on the DVD's is nonexistant! The picture is grainy and blurry and pretty much awful!
The relatively recent bluray-box however is created from the 35mm originals, and looks pretty spectacular in comparison!
-Worth it! I discovered this series from season 2 and I simply loved it. Back then, I was a teenager and the jokes and scenarios were just what I was looking for: characters to which we can quickly get attached, simple stories about love, work, friendship, etc. I don´t know how many times I have seen each episode from season 2 to season 5. However, while trying to catch-up with season 1 long later (we didn´t have internet back then so we relied on TV and for some reason, it hadn´t been aired since a while), I was surprised to find it so flat compared with seasons 2, 3 and 4. Season 5 is still great but the show had lost a bit of its energy. I kept on watching seasons 6 to 10 as I had got attached to the characters but as I had grown up, I started noticing some inconsistencies and some jokes had become a bit too predictable. Also, the ´love story´ that was introduced some time during season 9 really annoyed me as I could not picture it actually working. I think it was to regain the audience but it added to the inconsistencies of the script. In spite of all this, Friends is amongst the most popular shows still today so I guess it did a good job overall. This is a detailed review of my all time favorite sitcom Friends. And I wish you find it interesting.<br/><br/>Starting with the direction:<br/><br/>This sitcom had been directed by Martha Kaufman and Bright, some of the episodes were directed by David schwimmer ,more famously known as quirky Ross Geller to us. The director has done a commendable job .He knew exactly the amount of time to be given to a particular actor, the timing of each and every moment in the show is perfect.The best part is that one can relate to the show.The directorial work is flawless.The combination of actors chosen by director is irreplaceable.<br/><br/>Moving on to Story:<br/><br/>Each and every episode of this show is gripping. You laugh, you cry, you even feel angry (I mostly felt angry with Rachel).This story is a tremendous blend of emotions. Story writer knew what and when a event should take place (Spoiler: Take for instance Monica and Chandlers affair or Ross and Rachel's break thing or Joey's crush over Rachel).Last but certainly not the least the way they ended the show (Only tin hearted man couldn't have cried in the finale).<br/><br/>Next on the list is Acting:<br/><br/>Can there be a better cast?!! Certainly not, Chandler as sarcastic as ever (BBT Lovers Sheldon is nowhere near Chandler).Very well played by Matthew Perry.Matt Le blanc plays Joey. Joey is kind of dumb but sweet and cute. And certainly Chandler and Joey,s bromance is one pf the things that I can never forget. Then there is Monica Geller played by Courtney cox. She is an actress of her own class. Monica is kind of bossy, kind of has an undesirable need of pleasing people (Well She can never be wrong!!!). I personally think Courtney was the best actress in the show. Then there is our unique or more of weird Phoebe played by Lisa Kudrow. Phoebe is kinda weird but is the one with highest of the values in the show. And I guess there couldn't have been a better partner then mike for her. Then its Rachel Greene (I personally hated her personality) played by gorgeous Jennifer Aniston. Though she was kinda mean but yet she was the most courageous among others ( I felt it when she was ready to raise Emma all on her own or when she left the altar at her own wedding with Barry). David schwimmer has given one of the best performance on the show as Ross Geller, the quirky but a simple and a caring guy. Though I felt he was insecure about his relationships ( When Rachel became friends with mark ) or when it came to the friendship between Chandler and him or Joey and himself.<br/><br/>The final verdict is its the best sitcom ever. Again you will love them, hate them, cry for them and I thing somewhere in your subconscious you will feel inspired by them and yes they might actually make you feel great when you feel sad.<br/><br/>P.S: The character development is one of the best things of the show<br/><br/>"I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU...................." A story of the friends. It will remind your life, every time. I do not know what to write. Just watch it, you will never forgot, trust me. The 6 people who live in Manhattan. Have some unique interaction. My favorite character was Chandler Bing. He is funny, a lot of fun. Others are also good. The caring and crazy Monica Geller, Phoeby Buffey, who is another crazy person. Ross Geller, Monica's big brother, a geek, Rachel green and Joey Tribbioni'S stupidity is also awesome. After end of the day, you just fall in love with the show. I will never love any other TV show of my life time. The things I just write here is not overrated. I miss all of my friends now. Whenever I miss them more I just see one episode of friends. It makes me happy. But, after season finale I just cry a lot. Thanks for the actors/Actress and directors for such a evergreen show. I am lucky to see in my life time. The best show ever . The show that went for 10 straight years and never lost the charm . The show that was full of feelings . The feelings that were never felt before , by this I mean the relation of Joey and Chandler that was way more than friends , was more than brothers it was like an elder baby which was the most amazing thing in the whole season and then all those celebrities appearances. Moreover the Quality of Humor was brilliant and its started in 1994 and I watched it 11 years after its end but I loved it equally which means that the season is independent of a time frame and worth watching again and again . The only sitcom show in the history of the world which people might have cried watching . I wished it would have never ended but every thing has an end and thats the reality of life . Hilarious - one of the greatest comedy series of all time.<br/><br/>The lives of six twenty- (later, thirty-) something friends living in Manhattan. Their relationships, work, troubles and triumphs, all told with biting wit.<br/><br/>Very funny and, as someone who was in my twenties when the show started, incredibly relatable. Sure, it does present a stylized and almost idealistic picture of being a young, single adult, but that's part of its charm.<br/><br/>Casting is largely spot-on and launched the careers of all six of its stars. Some of the guest stars were pretty incredible too... No one can deny the big impact that FRIENDS left behind on each and every one of us, it's not all because of the great stories, the unforgettable scenes or the marvelous acting, it's the idea of how to take a simple life with a humble offer -just like ours- and turn it to a masterpiece. It's a complex of tears, love and joy, which are evenly distributed. If you didn't watch it, then stop every thing that is moving and open the box of FRIENDS and star watching with a smile on your face. You will Interestingly notice the evolving of the characters through the seasons as it happens in real life to each and every one of us. It is a real life with real people.<br/><br/>Be ready to change your life. Even ten years after the end of "Friends", it's still with enthusiasm that I watch every episode. Ten years after, I still laugh to Chandler's jokes; I laugh because Ross'faces are funny; I laugh because the dialog are great and the characters are even more than that. I've watched every episode from season 1 to season 10 an incalculable number of time. I know some lines by heart because they're just cult. My favorite season is definitely the last one, season 10. Like a good wine, "Friends" got better with the time. I loved when Joey tried to learn French, when Phoebe wanted to change her name... So many comical situations, so many lovable characters. I wish this show never ended. Now, I have a dream: I want "Friends" to be back on screen. Because this show is just timeless. I am just totally in love with friends. I think that it can appeal to anyone who loves a good love story, a comedy, a tale of friendship and even a bit of a tear jerker. I am proud to say I have seen every episode at least 10 times and they never get boring. My boyfriend wasn't at all interested in friends before he met me but now that he has watched a few with me he can't get enough!!!! My favourite moments have got to be when Ross takes Rachel to the museum for their first date, when Joey punches Ross, when Ross gets a tan, when Monica and Chandler get married, when Ross is fine!!, when Ross and Rachel have a baby, when Monica and Chandler adopt, when Pheobie gets married and when Rachel gets off the plane!!!! I could go on but I won't.... Just stick an episode on and enjoy! You'll seldom find shows like Friends, that were long lasting without considerable drops in quality. During it's ten seasons, we've witnessed the life of six main characters and a myriad of recurring characters and guest stars.<br/><br/>Probably the strongest message is that all of the six characters are good, no matter what situations they're going through and misunderstandings they might be causing. At the same time, the strongest quality of Friends is that the show never became sleazy.<br/><br/>Since i've invested a couple of months in watching the show in its entirety minus the bloopers and the interviews, i think i've had a good overview. Seasons 1 to 6 were the "organic growth" in terms of plot and character development. Seasons 7 and 8 were the most mature and 9 and 10 were the logical "phase-out". Actually, there was not much left to be said in the given environment... Quite simply one of the best shows ever made. It starts just like any other show and with time, it drives you in, and before you know it it's a major part of your life. Every scene, every punchline, every little expression makes you fall in love with it. I think the level it has achieved over the years and how successful it has been, still don't do the show justice. It's an amazing ride which epitomizes the highs and lows of life. Every human feeling is beautifully portrayed in the show. I was particularly impressed by the story as a whole. Like there are shows which hit their highs and then can't figure out where to go with it, believe me there's nothing like that in here. All in all a very well thought out, hilarious sitcom. Absolutely love this show. In my opinion there is just nothing like Friends. Anyone at all can relate to either one of the characters, one of the situations, dilemmas, thoughts, feelings, morals, expressed in the show. It doesn't matter the age (of course I'd say 14+ for mature content), it doesn't matter what gender, it's a genius show that somehow captures every aspect of one's life. Weddings, Marriage, proposals, break ups, getting back together, jealously, addictions, fights, faithfulness, divorces, relationships with parents, friends, children, work, peer pressure, bullying, sexual orientation, adoption, homelessness, survival, every day struggles, weight challenges, loosing oneself, finding oneself, being judgemental, being non-judgemental, identity crisis, career challenges, one-night-stands, pregnancy, surrogacy, May-December relationships, over critical parents, favouritism, religion differences, belief differences, Anger, Sadness, cheating, team work, only child, siblings, losing jobs, relationships with co-workers, parties, contemplation of life, dreams, aspirations, meaning of friendship, meaning of family, acceptances, non- acceptances, guys perspective, girl's perspective, matters of principle, to name a few as I'm forgetting many others, but seriously ANYTHING you can think of. I'm 30 years old, and I still watch the entire series from 1-10. At least 2 or 3 times out of the year I will watch the episodes back to back. My husband laughs at me, but he also thinks it's cute and he can't help himself but watch it with me too! Long long long live the greatest show on earth....Friends! now, this just goes to the benefit of my fellows, the ones that i probably share more memories with than any other F.R.I.E.N.D in my life. i know that i can watch them day and night and never get full.<br/><br/>starting with Ross, my favorite; I don't understand why he is so underrated ? it just pisses me off? we get it, chandler's the funny head, and Joey's the stupid one, but don't you think Ross delivers much better as he is the science head of the show and scientists aren't funny which gives him the hardest part ? I absolutely love Ross;3 ,, <br/><br/>then to Chandler; man, this guy, sometimes he's even #1 for me, especially at the "being the best that Monica's ever had" he nailed it 100% XD , his sarcasm isn't boring, i would love to have a person like that in my life ;D<br/><br/>Phoebe; we all know that the men are funnier than the women on this show, but Phoebe is a great comedian which puts her right next to the men at this, and she sometimes beats the hell out of them, her screams, her innocence, she is with no doubt the funniest out of the three girls.<br/><br/>Joey; you're never gonna have enough of Tribbiani ;D , he absolutely has the best facial expressions EVER! and he eats a lot which kinda relates him to me :3 , <br/><br/>Rachel & Monica: can't decide which one's my least favorite, these two being at the bottom doesn't underestimate them, I mean the show is absolutely something with them! but they're funny at the lines they're given and they add just a little to the show on their own, Monica's obsession is awesome, and Aniston's an excellent actress, I really don't know why does she stick for cheap roles nowadays, she certainly can do much better. I was hooked from the first episode I saw. The witty characters, the funny one-liners, the sometimes unfortunate timing in the lives of the people portrayed. It all came together so perfectly. Everyone who watches Friends easily finds a character he or she can relate to. Monica with her obsessive need to clean the apartment (and sometimes its not even her apartment!!) Chandler with his mother-issues. Phoebe who is so clueless sometimes. Anyway when the series ended it was like loosing a bunch of friends of my own and I gladly spend an afternoon now and then revisiting them and laughing as hard as the first time cause it is its timeless comedic style the makes Friends what it is. A wonderful show for everyone who knows about friendship and what it takes to make it work. This show has a 8.9 but it's still underrated! It deserves a 10, to my opinion, but a >9.5 would be pretty close to it's real worth too.<br/><br/>The people who created Friends have a special gift, otherwise this show wouldn't be so damn funny and so successful. And with 'people' I do not only mean David Crane and Marta Kauffman. I'm not saying that without Jennifer Aniston, Courteny Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer this show would suck but I think it would be less funny. And that's because these actors make the Friends characters alive in such a fun way that EVERY episode I laugh my ass off... Even after 15 times I've seen all ten series. But we shouldn't forget the writers of course! 'Cause, and that's a sure thing, without them this show WOULD've sucked. The dialogues they write are hilarious and, yes I'll say it again, make me laugh at EVERY episode! Even when I'm not watching the show they make me laugh when I'm paying a picture in my head.<br/><br/>I don't think I can say more about this show without boring the few people that read this comment. Just that this is THE BEST COMEDY SHOW EVER and it's major UNDERRATED.<br/><br/>I give it a 10/10, please do that too, 'cause than you have a great knowledge of what funny is. Friends features the comedic lives of six people living in New York city. Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey and Chandler all live in apartment towers and regularly have social time with one another either at their apartments or at the 'Central Perk' coffee house where Phoebe sometimes plays her guitar and Rachel is the love interest of the bartender Gunther. The comedy involves many plots, such as a new piece of furniture or a new relationship or somesuch thing, and is similar to Seinfeld in its lack of long plots and continuity. It is quite entertaining and worth watching. At present it is on Channel Ten at six rather than The Simpsons so i watch it instead and its not that bad. The humour is quite intelligent, using much wordplay and complex gags as well as simple social gags. Whenever troubles arise they always wn in the end and the show has a very upbeat feel about it. I registered in IMDb just to write a comment on Friends. Because I have to. That is the least I can do for this great show. There is not a single episode in their 10 seasons that's not funny. It's so amazing how the creators and writers made each friend with a distinct character. And how they evolve through those characteristics through 10 long seasons. I have watched most of highly rated comedy shows, but I have never laughed as hard as watching Friends. And I know I never will. Maybe because Friends set the bar too high. Friends was a show out of this world. I cant believe how so many lame shows go on for so many seasons, and they had to stop this show, Friends: Lord of the Comedies. I have watched through most seasons for many times and I will continue it for a long long time. Because I never can get tired of their jokes. I only got into Friends last year, after watching some of the bloopers. I had seen some episodes during its original run and enjoyed them, but never followed the story of the show. Now, after watching the entirety of its 10-year run all the way through, I can safely say that Friends is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time.<br/><br/>Friends is one of those shows where you'll really get to know the characters. I think this is one of its greatest strengths, and part of the reason it was, and still is, so popular. By the end of the show, you will feel like they're YOUR friends - and you'll wish that you had a group of friends like them! It's impossible not to become emotionally attached to one or all of the characters, as they are each endearing in their own way.<br/><br/>For me, and for lots of others - as is evident from a lot of online polls and surveys - Chandler Bing (played by Matthew Perry) is the best character in the show. His sarcastic wisecracks and exceptional comic timing make him a delight to watch, especially when paired with Joey (Matt LeBlanc). Together, they make one of the most memorable TV duos - and for good reason! But whether it's Chandler and Joey you like, Monica (the obsessive neat-freak), Phoebe (the kooky masseuse), Rachel (the spoilt girl making it on her own) or Ross (the geeky but romantic college professor) you like, you're sure to find a character to relate to.<br/><br/>The show is also strengthened by its guest stars, especially recurring characters such as Ross and Monica's parents, Judy and Jack Geller, and Chandler's nightmare ex-girlfriend, Janice. The running gags in this show never get old, and persistent viewers are treated to in-jokes that are constantly funny.<br/><br/>Although I feel the show is weaker in its later seasons, due to the greater focus on plot and sentiment as opposed to the all-out comedy of some of the earlier seasons, it still stands strong on its own. And the show is not without its faults - there are a few things I would have certainly changed if I were a writer - but on the whole, they got it right, and the result is a show that fails to disappoint.<br/><br/>On a closing note, I'd just like to say that Friends is a show that never tries to be something it isn't - it isn't groundbreaking comedy, or incredibly high-brow, but it never aims to be. It's light, funny, and something that will cheer you up when you're feeling down. Whenever I am feeling low, I can guarantee that firing up the DVD player and watching an episode of Friends will leave me with a smile on my face. And that's what it's all about, isn't it? This show is really a masterpiece. One of the best sitcom's comedy in the world. This 6 friends, is my friends, and yours friends and yours and yours and yours, this 6 Friends is everybody's friends. After the first season, you'll be excited that you pick this sitcom to watch. Comments about actors? Ooh, there is... Joey: Italian actor, very very funny, has his own style and one of my favorites! Monica: Very ingenious actress, some hilarious ways too see things, she is a pleasant surprise. Ross: Monica's brother, he's a lover. Loved Rachel, since the first episode, to the very last. Funny too! Rachel: Ooh, Rachel! She is beautiful, has a style of a elegant girl. This show, is not the same show, without her! Phoeby: Yes, Phoeby. Phoeby is some of a very talented actress. In the show, she really fits in well. Chandler: I have to say: Chandler is the BEST in this show. Really the best. Very, very, very funny, he has the style, to make the show, ONE OF THE BEST SITCOME'S EVER!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed all of the 10's seasons, and get my advice: WATCH THIS SHOW! Friends has to be one of the best sitcoms ever made, i just love it! I own them all in a box set and i just have to put one on and im instantly uplifted. Its so funny, the script is just amazing and all the actors play their characters so well, you really believe that it is true life and you really feel for the characters and the situations they all go through. From watching the show from the start to the end i really feel like i have grown up with them and gone through their journeys with them. Its just the best show and i love Chandler so much, he is just so funny and witty, they are all amazing in their own light. Well done for making one of the best things on t.v, i don't know what i would have done without growing up watching it. 10 out of 10. This show has to be one of the best shows on TV! I love all of the characters in it (Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and finally Ross) and I love the live audience.Personly, I like Joey (Matt LaBlanc) the best because he is so dumb but in a funny way. I love how each character has their own personality. It clearly was a hit on TV! In season 8 I can't believe that Rachel gets pregnant and Ross is the father. Their life must be really complicated. I also can't believe that Chandler and Monica get married. The sad thing is though is that Monica can't have children and they have to adopt which is really sweet. Anyway all I can say is W-O-W!!!! The BEST! No more words needed! You laugh and you cry, mainly cry because the show has ended or from laughing so hard your stomach hurts. Nothing will ever come close to being as good as this show, never ever. The script is witty and spot on every time, you never see anything coming because the characters will always surprise you with some unexpected, hilarious opinion.<br/><br/>It's so hard to choose a favourite episode because they all are so good, the actors all fit together and it is all so believable you do tend to believe the 6 people u see in front you are actually your friends.<br/><br/>I love it and I miss it so much. I'm a fan forever. Me , like many other people from all around the world , have watched every episode of friends again and again. This TV show has made me laugh over and over again, it has made me love all the 6 characters and their lives and has put me into their reality. I am a little bit more sensitive about Ross's and Rachel's love affair and the episodes where the two of them where ''not in a break'' were my sweetest.<br/><br/>I am really sad it ended ,although I watch the repeats every week on TV and I would love to see the 6 of them again to an episode which would show them meet again just for one time.. maybe the producers should think about it!!<br/><br/>So, from Greek fellows<br/><br/>all my love to everyone<br/><br/>Kelly 6 friends are always together but, at the same time, have their own lives. It's really hilarious.Every friend has his/her own personality which makes "Friends" a brilliant pastime. The only drawback is that it has to finish. I've watched the complete series twice and I don't get bored of it! In case anyone wants to watch the bets episodes, my favourites are the 21st and the last of the third season, the 1st of the 4th season and the last of the tenth season!they are absolutely brilliant, but I recommend you watch them all in order. Each season represents a year, so there are ten Christmas' and thanks givings which are always great! and if you don't know what to give someone for a present get them a season, my sister did that for my birthday and months later I still enjoy it as much as when I got it! and if you are trying to learn another language it's great as you don't get tired of it, so you can watch it in your language and some time later in another so that you can understand it but listening to another language (my boyfriend is studying English-he's Spanish- and watches friends in English with me!). Enjoy! 'Friends' began in 1994: I was just three years old, and, as you will appreciate, not really at the right stage to watch it. By the time I was thirteen, and 'Friends' was almost finished, I was an addict. There is no other word for it.<br/><br/>Let's begin by analysing why this show is so funny. On paper, it may not seem it - a group of good-looking white twenty-somethings, hanging around drinking coffee and dating.<br/><br/>But when you look at the sheer skill of the 'Friends' writers, you have to see that this is truly comedy at its best. There are so many funny one-liners. Here, I think it would be appropriate to mention another user's comments. Someone said "there is endless laughter after every line... so it must be funny, right?". And the thing is, it IS right. 'Friends' is enormously funny, yet its humour is surprisingly hard to pinpoint.<br/><br/>The characters are highly developed, and each with their own brand of humour (so there is something for everyone). Monica, the obsessive neat-freak with a burning desire for a family; Ross, her vulnerable elder brother who seems to be the quintessential family guy yet has trouble making a marriage stick (for various reasons which I will not go into at length - lesbianism being an issue here!); Phoebe, ditzy and blonde, yet with a deep and mysterious quality; Chandler, the underdog, with the highly developed sense of sarcastic humour which is the province of only the most maligned; Joey - sweet and dumb, but with a golden heart. And then there's Rachel, the spoilt brat turned girl-about-town, who never really realises that what she's always wanted is right in front of her.<br/><br/>I am not going to deny that there are flaws in 'Friends' - the sentimental scenes do have more than a tinge of saccharine to them (I personally cannot watch the final episode without cringing) - and sometimes the storyline wavers a little. But the comedy - note here, the COMEDY, which is, as it should be, the essence of the show - remains intact, always.<br/><br/>People are always ready to critise 'Friends' for one thing or another. But the truth is, and this is backed up by the sky-high ratings, that 'Friends' does everything a sitcom should do. And it's damn funny, with it. Thank God for DVDs and re-runs. friends is one of the best comedies on TV .the 6 main characters Rachel (Jennifer aniston),Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette),Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow),Joey (Matt Le Blanc),Chandler (Matthew Perry)and Ross (David Schwimmer)in the ten years it was on Rachel had a baby girl called Emma with Ross in series 8,ross also had a baby with carol named Ben in series 1,chandler married Monica in series 7,phoebe married mike in series 10 and joey had many failed acting parts in days of our lives,my favourite character was Monica because she was a warm-hearted person but she was also very sarcastic which made her a great character i also liked joey because he was such a charm with his catchphrase "how you doing?"friends will always be heard off Friends is a TV show that isn't just hilariously funny, it's also realistic. It's so realistic that it makes you feel like you're actually in that situation. Ross, Monica, Rachel, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey are the type of friends one could only dream of having in the future, each unique in their own way. Often, after watching an episode, I find myself laughing because in my mind, I'm thinking of a funny scene from the episode.<br/><br/>For 11 seasons, Friends have not only made our cheeks (and insides) sore from laughing so hard, they have also given us something to talk, laugh, and cry about when we are talking with OUR own friends in the coffee shops, sipping coffee a young waitress just served. Each episode has touched our hearts in a special and memorable way different from all the other episodes you've watched. It's no wonder why millions of people have supported a hit TV show for 11 seasons and why even more have watched the final episode, as we said our final farewells and goodbyes to Friends, as we thanked them for all the many laughs, tears, cries, heartbreaks, heartaches and joys Rachel, Joey, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler and Monica have brought to us for the past 11 years...and will continue to bring to us for many years to come. I think that the the writing is amazing, and the acting is amazing! Evrething about this show is amazing.You cant help but love the characters because they are so lovable.Candler the sarcastic one, phobee the ditsy one,monica the clean freak,rachel the pampered independent,joey the ladies man,and Ross the braineac. I think we can relate to all of these people.it's romantic,dramatic,but above all very,very,funny.my favorite character is chandler because he is the funniest one and i think i can relate to him best.who ever your favorite person is he/she will make you laugh your head off. that is why i think friends is THE BEST SHOW EVER! Unfortunately when the TV show friends was shown for the first time on TV i was too young to watch it. however when i grew up and had the ability to do so, i didn't. i was lucky enough to make some new friends who informed me about it, telling me how funny it was. the same week i watched the show and since then i never lost an episode. i was nine years old and because i had missed so many episodes i rent all the previous DVD's in order to get along with the whole story.<br/><br/>Friends are definitely one of the best TV shows ever. not only the roles are great but the actors as well. maybe right now the show is over but i can't forget how much i was laughing every time i was watching it.i wish i were a part of such a companionship.having as friends Joey,Rachel,Ross,Monica,Phoebe and Chandler is a wish i would easily make instead of being rich. having so much fun in a companionship is everyone's dream.<br/><br/>i 'd like to thank everybody who contributed to take this show place.i will never stop watching all these episodes which make me feel just so great.just so happy.just so... the sitcom is the best i've ever seen.i'm not really a TV person but once i watched one episode,i became completely sucked in.the actors are great.it was so real.i cried each time Ross and Rachel went on ''a break''.i laughed every time chandler did his dance or made some sarcastic comment about something or someone.i laughed each time joey guarded his food with his life.it was always fun to see Monica freak out about something and chandler fixed everything(though that rarely happened).Phoebe's songs were always funny.all six of them were great.i don't think friends would have been as much fun or success,if there had been a different cast.i have to say i feel really sad now that it has ended.my elder brother and i are the greatest fans of friends ever.we cant make up our minds which character we like best.they are all awesome.i am yet to see a sitcom that would be as funny,interesting,heart-warming and great as friends.none can even come close! Since Friends officially walked out of Monica and Chandler's apartment to the great Central Perk for their last cup of coffee, I have bought all eight seasons of Friends on DVD and watched every one of them. I am impatiently waiting for seasons nine and ten. Over the years I have sadly watched the final episodes of some of my favorite shows such as Mash, Seinfeld, Bob Newhart, and Frasier, to name a few. The 'ending' of Friends was a very poignant time for me and my family. For ten years, my daughters and I waited for Thursday nights to watch our favorite TV show....Friends. Joey, Ross, Chandler, Monica, Rachel and Phoebe were indeed our "friends", as we loved each character. Through the investment of the Friends DVDs, they will remain a part of our lives forever. I was a late blooming "Friends" fan; I didn't begin to watch the show until 2002. At first, I was appalled by the way they all slept around, but as I was able to view the show (in syndication) from the beginning, I became a permanent and ardent fan. Who wouldn't love these oh-so-human girls and guys next door? <br/><br/>The actors are superb and in my opinion, too good for the material they were given. For the most part, the characters are believable but some of the stuff more than borders on the ridiculous. Somehow, however, each episode is nothing short of hilarious. We hurt when Ross and Rachel break up. We fervently wish Chandler would find someone to love him for himself. We pray to God that Joey doesn't get an incurable disease. And we are drawn into these hopeful young peoples' lives and made to feel like we're also sharing a cuppa joe and listening intently to Monica's dating problems or Phoebe's horrendous songs. <br/><br/>I am not ashamed to admit that I cried when the last episode was aired. It was like seeing my children leave the nest and fly on their own. This show makes you care that much. I would personally like to thank everyone involved; there'll never be another show like Friends. WOW ten years and still strong, not many sitcoms stay like that! Sure it had its bad years (8 and 9 in particular) but the show has always been funny and a bit of light humor to brighten your day! The writing is always consistent and the script is acted beautifully by possibly the best ensemble cast ever created! The cast interact so well together even in the pilot that its like they have known each other forever. What a great show, i have nothing bad to say about it.<br/><br/>Friends will stay in the hearts of many forever!!!<br/><br/>FRIENDS TILL THE END 1994-2004 :-( When Friends began way back in 1994, I was not swept by the euphoria that this TV series started. I did not find it funny, in fact I found it rather silly and could not relate to the 6 characters created. Then one day, I was watching an episode that I started laughing at, then from that time on I was able to relate to Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe, and the crazy antics that each one of them seems to get into.<br/><br/>
This half-hour comedy features six young friends who face life and love in New York. Together, they find true companionship and comfort as they get entangled in numerous hilarious dilemmas. Through any circumstance, the group have a bond of friendship that helps them laugh while dealing with the world around them.<br/><br/>The show was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and they must be astounded by the popularity of the show. To create such interesting characters was wonderful, with the difference in personalities being fascinating.<br/><br/>This leads me to the dedicated writing team that have brought us 'Friends'. Helping Crane and Kauffman is a huge team of writers. All of these writers have continued to come up with funny, interesting and shocking storylines. It also has to be said, that these people do have a very fine sense of humour, as some of the lines these characters say are priceless. It is credit to these people for how fresh the stories have stayed for the show.<br/><br/>
The main characters are all people I have grown to love as I have got to known them. Here is a small piece on each of them:<br/><br/>Rachel (Jennifer Aniston): Rachel is a very good girl at heart, although she can be tough to get along with when she wants. She has a history with Ross that has been funny to see as the years have gone on. It is a known fact that Rachel cannot cook or make a decent cup of coffee. Jennifer Aniston is simply stunning in this role and is probably the only actor out of this six that has been able to transgress into mainstream movie acting.<br/><br/>
Ross (David Schwimmer): Ross is a guy that has had some really bad luck, but you would have to also say that he is pretty stupid for some of the things that he does. He has been divorced three times (one from a wife who is now a lesbian). Ross also has some of the more crazy stuff happen to him. David Schwimmer is a very interesting actor, as he really does make a fool of himself for the millions of people around the world. Interesting note: Schwimmer has directed a few episodes of 'friends' as well.<br/><br/>
Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette): Monica is Ross' younger sister, a girl who is very head strong, stubborn, unbeatable (in her mind) and someone who likes to get her own way. She is also a person that is very articulate and likes to keep things extremely clean. Monica was once overweight, eating everything she could get her hands on. Courtney Cox is very good at being Monica, with her strange personality a little over the top, while her performances as overweight 'Monica', being the best in the entire show. Cox has been a part of the famous 'Scream' trilogy, which has helped her career. It was funny to see the episode where all the cast had the name 'Cox-Arquette' attached with there names.<br/><br/>Chandler (Matthew Perry): Chandler is the comedian in the group, always likes to laugh, tell a joke or make a smart comment in a conversation. Yet he knows when has said a bad line. Chandler for the best part of the show has had terrible luck with relationships, until he hooked up with Monica, which was one of the big highlights to the show. The lengths that the pair go to hide the fact was very funny. Chandler's parents were also very interesting to meet. Perry plays his part very well (no joke).<br/><br/>
Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow): Phoebe is the wacky part of the group. She sings and plays guitar at the coffee shop, albeit badly. She has lost a mother, has an identical twin and has been a surrogate mother for her half brother Frank and his older partner Alice, making her life a bit twisted. Yet through all this she has a very sexy confident manner, which is irresistible not to like. She says and does some of the more silly things, not too unlike Ross. Kudrow plays Phoebe as if she is really like her, but I would be guessing that Kudrow is much different to Phoebe in real life.<br/><br/>
Joey (Matt LeBlanc): Joey is the guy all the women die for. Well that is what Joey wants us to believe anyway. He is, I guess, charismatic, but only ever in a relationship for the goal to sleep with the woman in question. Joey is an actor, playing Dr. Drake Ramoray in 'Days Of Our Lives'. He is the unintelligent person in the group, but covers it up pretty well. Joey also has seven sisters. Matt LeBlanc is great as this character, although he is way different to Joey in real life.<br/><br/>'Friends' has had some impressive guest stars including Elle MacPherson, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Selleck, Helen Hunt, Morgan Fairchild and George Clooney to name just a few. I like the sets the show has had, as they are well made and suit the show well. This is a big task for the crew that assemble them. I also love the theme song to Friends titled 'I'll be there for you' sung by the Rembrandts. With Friends now coming to an end, the TV world is losing a big show, as is the audience which it pleases. But we all have to be thankful, that for ten years, our lives have been enriched by six extraordinary people, people I call 'Friends'. Friends seems such an unoriginal idea. 6 New-Yorkers, who just happen to be 3 boys and 3 girls, with different career styles and personalities living and hanging out together. I guess it's all about the chemistry and the things you can do with the characters, probably why it lasted a decade. All the Friends have interesting storylines (Ross espically) and ones together. It's brilliantly written with great jokes, a great sitcom (strange to seem a great sitcom starring young people). Phoebe and Joey are really funny characters, their dumbness is the reason and their loveibility. Monica was a wonderfully sweet girl at the beginning with a sense of tidiness and bossiness but in the later series, it seems she's been absolutely transformed into this loud, bossy, hardly sweet girl and I always wished for the old Monica back. Ross maybe annoying to some but he does end up with the best lines sometimes in episodes. Rachel is overrated. She may be a big star in real life, being married to Brad Pitt, but it doesn't make her the best character on the show as that goes to Chandler. Who's always being funny and I don't care if the other characters don't like his jokes because I do. The early series was better than the later series, I wish Phoebe married David instead of Mike but it's still great and watchable. Here's to Friends, a great series and a great decade. As many of the people writing in this page, I also love Friends, I´ve got all the series in DVD and  can´t wait till #10# is out, although I´m in Spain and I know it´ll take longer... Anyway, what I can never understand, whether it is about this show or about any other one, is people who are so worried or upset because it doesn´t reflect the reality of New York or the place they are set. I think they fail to grasp that it is only a TV show, not a documentary. I simply watch it cos it´s funny and I love the way the actors play their roles, and it´d be stupid trying to identify myself with any of the characters-wake up, they are not real life!!.The same way I used to watch and enjoy Bill Cosby´s show (although I´m not black), or Will & Grace (although I´m not gay) or 92010 Beverly Hills when I was younger (although I´m not rich), and I never even thought about trying to identify my life with theirs. It´s just plain common sense!!! (sorry, English is not my mother tongue but I hope you guys<br/><br/>understand what I mean...) Anyway, I can wait till series #10# airs in Spain and then comes out in DVD, so that I can enjoy this show forever for what it is, a great TV show. I used to not like Friends. When my father told me about that show i didn't like. But when I watch it, I loved. I love so much that I can watch this every day, all day... It's so funny! And when I'm sad the only thing that make me happy is watch it!!! And I think That is because that, Friends is the best show ever!!!! The show has had it's time and maybe it is time to move on. The show began slowly in my opinion but hit it's stride by the second season when rachel and ross finnaly got to together but that never lasted. The third season was a bit boring at times but then the fourth season was the best it was funny from the jellyfish episode to the wedding in london. Then came the fifth season which was great at times until the monica & chandler love affair was reavealed the next two two years chandler got less funny and rachel became a evil evil person, monica became a control freak. The seventh season was the worst but it picked up last year and now i am waiting for the ninth season will ross and rachel just sort it out and get together. I've tried, I really have.  I have watched a total of two episodes of this show and simply cannot see why everyone says that it is a funny show, let alone the funniest show on TV.  The plots are lame, the cast terribly un-funny and, well, I can just feel my brain melt whenever it comes on.<br/><br/>
If you like shows like Mad About You (yecch!), Frasier (gag!) or Home Improvement (please kill me!) then this show is right up your alley.<br/><br/>
If you want real television comedy then catch a re-run of Seinfeld, the best live-action show on TV ever.<br/><br/>Hopefully Friends will end soon and someone will "misplace" all of the episode tapes so we will never be subjected to it again. This series used to be so funny, I mean, it still is funny at times, but as soon as the marriage seasons started (first with Emily, then Chandler/Monica), the series shifted slowly into Soap Opera hell.<br/><br/>Chandler has/had the most brilliant, sarchastic lines, which really made the series more watchable. Why do the other "Friends" pick on Chandler and look upon him as a worthless jerk, when he's about the most likeable character in the show? Always hints at him being less manly (or something). In his relationship with Monica he's now the whipped dog, always "luuuvving" his wife, slowly becoming less and less funny.<br/><br/>Now, the series are sticky, full of crying and love-declarations. A series that tries to make us believe that a girl's favorite dream is to walk around in a wedding dress, or better: to get married. You would think a sex-fixated series like this would've dared to say that people could DROP MARRIAGE and still be happy, but no.. keep the US family friendly-trash.. (to be honest I don't know why you americans accept this family-propaganda BS) Right now where I live, they're showing Joey falling in love with Rachel, and it's just pure sickening. Joey is only slightly funny in his normal role as incredibly stupid, but when he starts acting emotional, it's throw-up-time.<br/><br/>When Phoebe "juggles" two boys or the female characters act slutty in other ways, that's OK, but the boys are always nice, trying to tidy things up, stay pure-hearted and honest-ish; a moral mistake from a boy in Friends is strongly punished. Phoebe is the kind of goose-like woman no man would ever want; still in the series, she'd kick out any wimp-ass man to get the next italian-looking dork who walks past her. She generally acts judgemental and evil in most episodes now, but never gets the kind of low status Chandler has gotten. It was funnier when she was just plain stupid; she was a good "stupid/ crazy character" in her time. Ah well..<br/><br/>There has to have been some excellent writers behind the scenes here, but they've obviously gotten too slow, too old.<br/><br/>This series is wrecked, and to be honest, even in it's most wild, funny episodes, it wasn't even close to Seinfeld in quality. I am glad to see that I am not the only one who thinks that Friends is just a big waste of time and talent. (And I use the word "talent" here loosely.)I have tried to watch Friends on many occasions and it has never made me laugh. I think the plots are lame, the jokes are stupid, and the characters are certainly not people that I would consider being friends with. How this show can be the #1 show in America right now is beyond me.<br/><br/>
Also, by reading a lot of the comments here from Friends fans, I have determined that the average Friends fan has the intelligence and  maturity level of a six year-old child. Not everybody enjoys watching this brain-killing garbage, so get over it already! Since 1994 the sextet of the hit TV show Friends has kept fans around the world glued to their TV sets every Thursday night at 7:00. And I think the reason is that this group of unmistakable talent in someway connects with their audience. The show has brilliant writers, and a committed cast. When you watch the show you feel like they are your best friends. When they go through something the audience goes through it with them. The show is a hit because it is real, and you can connect with the plots that the writers so brilliantly put together. It's the gem of NBC, and should be the bases of what every successful sitcom should be. Once you get past the fact that the people on friends have been the same age for years, have switched the number to their apartment buildings, and would not have enough money to own a beautiful apartment on the village, with a wonderful view.You can see that Friends is a wonderful show with creative writing, humor, good acting, and even sometimes morals. The storyline in Friends evolves each season to something new and unexpected. All though if you really get down to it the show is not about 6 Friends that spend a freakish amount of time together, it is about the ever changing relationship between Rachel and Ross. Because if it did not have that story line I guess you can say it has no plot and it would be referred as Seinfeld 2. But the thing that isolates Friends from all the other shows is that no matter what is happening in the series or the real world it will always put a smile on your face The Best show ever. For those who say the show sucks, u should download the show or buy it. U have to watch it a few times before u get all the jokes in it. And they are damn funny.<br/><br/>If u have only watched a few episodes and say the show sucks, don't comment in here. YOU KNOW NUT!!! Of course not all the episodes are as fabolous as the others.<br/><br/>And if the show sucks,it wouldnt last for 8 years and has so many viewers.<br/><br/>One last word, i hope they would continue the series a few more years. :) I honestly don't know how Marta Kaufman, David Crane and the writing team at Friends have come up with the funniest episodes ever for like, nearly seven years now!! There's never been a bad season, a bad storyline or even a bad joke!!<br/><br/>The show is about (pathetic palentologist) Ross Gellar (David Schwimmer - 'Kissing A Fool', 'Breast Men, 'The Pallbearer') and his sister (neurotic chef) Monica (Courteney Cox-Arquette - 'Ace Ventura', the 'Scream' trilogy, 'Commandments') and their 4 other friends.<br/><br/>Then there's struggling actor Joey Tribbiani (Matt Le Blanc - 'Ed', 'Lost In Space', 'Charlie's Angels'), Chandler (what the hell *does* he do?) Bing (Matthew Perry - '3 To Tango', Fools Rush In', 'The Whole Nine Yards'), quirky singer, Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow - 'Romy & Michele', 'Opposite of Sex', 'Mother') and fashion-loving Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston - 'Picture Perfect', 'Object Of My Affection', 'She's The One').<br/><br/>Then of course, there's the sub-friends: Gunther (James Michael Taylor) a Central Perk waiter who lusts after Rach; Carol (Jane Sibbett), Ross's ex-wife-turned-lesbian; and Ursula, Phoebe's twin sister (and porn star!) - also played by Lisa Kudrow.<br/><br/>Ever since the very beginning, 'Friends' has been a very funny sitcom - fast-paced storylines, special guests, songs, satires... it has it all, and it's never hit a dry spell.<br/><br/>The gang keep pullin' out the gags about everything from Rach's crushes, Phoebe's past, Monica's jam and Chandler's possible hidden homosexuality!<br/><br/>If you're never seen it (and by now, you probably would have) - you have to watch it now! Well? Whatta waitin' for? Since its beginning Friends became a new step for comedy. Some people say it's a silly series. I think anybody who says that, doesn't know how to laugh. Friends is the funniest show on TV. I love wasting my time watching it. All the actors and their characters are extremely good, especially Joey and Phoebe (The funniest ones). The producers are very good at what they do. It lasted five years already. I hope it never ends. This show has no substance what so ever.  The jokes are not even funny, its just really stupid and childish.  The characters are very flat in this show. Every episode just plays out each characters single trait.  This show has become so predictable and boring that it doesn't even deserve to be on TV. I LOVE Friends and have watched it steadily from the very beginning. I'm orginally from New York so it's nice to see home. (Well sort of!) I was just going to comment on Friends on general but I just read the comment from a person in Knutsford and I just had to respond. Now I just saw the Friends episode when they are in London and it annoyed me how they portrayed english people as such IDIOTS. I've lived in London for the last 12 years and people do think I'm english, so this did offend me. Yes, there were good actors but I thought they were just downright crap. Jennifer Saunders was underplaying the part of Eddy from Ab-Fab but it wasn't funny it was BAD. Tom Conti and Hugh Laurie were laughable characters and I think Fergie, and Richard Branson's characters were pointless. And do americans really think all english people talk like they've got a plum in their mouth...well surprise they don't. But I do think the person from Knutsford was wrong in saying Friends is tired. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I think Friends just gets better and better. There has never been an episode where I haven't laughed. Russ, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are great characters and I hope Friends goes on for a while longer. Friends is definitely the best TV series ever! If you have never seen it, you won't regret for spend half an hour in front of the TV!! Its a comedy series about 6 friends that have to learn, by theirselves, how to survive in New York...  it won't be easy, but will be very funny!!<br/><br/>if you see it, you'll LOVE it!! I tried watching Friends not long after it debut and was not too impressed. This overrated sitcom is often poorly written and very predictable. The cast is composed of six misfits which come across quite un-funny. The humor is the usual for most 90's sitcoms, with irresponsible and cheap sexual gags.It has however, had it's funny moments but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>This show while a ratings powerhouse for NBC,is not a reflection of it's writing. I guess non-humorous dysfunctional characters appeal to a large segment. It's a shame that well written sitcoms such as NewsRadio never got the ratings they deserved, while a pathetic program such as Friends scored big numbers. This is one of my favorite shows. I love it so much. I watch it every Thursday night at 8PM. I give this show 10/10. My mother and sister watch this show too. My favorites are Rachel and Joey. I've been watching this show for quiet a few years now. Great show! I hope it keeps going for a while. Friends is an awful show!! I never liked it and never will. The writing sucks the actors can't even act. This show should have went off air along time ago. The only thing I like on that show is the sofa in the cafe. I'm ashamed to have this show in America. "Friends" is my all-time favorite television show that is completely hilarious!!! Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer are terrific!!! This is one of my favorite television shows ever!!!! Each episode keeps you laughing from beginning to end. This is a brillaint television show that is my favorite!!! I HIGHLY recommend this show to everyone!!! I give this brillaint show a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!  :) Hard to imagine more famous tv series than "Friends", however, I still stumble upon people that haven't seen a single episode. I believe they just skip it from stubborness, it's quite common to avoid something because of its popularity. Well, I don't recommend to do this.<br/><br/>The whole decade has passed with this wild bunch. So many hilarious and heartbreaking moments revolve around a group of six people. I cannot say that every situation portrayed in the show has real life analog, but they are funny. Not every season was outstanding, but repetition hasn't occurred once. It is completely understandable as no one's life can be a complete comedy.<br/><br/>A quick circle of tribute to the main characters should be done of course. The head of the group for me is Chandler: always sarcastic guy with tons of insecurities keeps an arsenal of jokes to defuse almost every situation - some people should try his methods. Joey - an ultimate foodie, womaniser...basically, Gluttony and Lust with a dumb attitude, but you cannot stop being amused with him. Ross - the most ordinary person of the group is the bridge to the viewer in my opinion, but also is a counterweight to all-fun colleagues. Phoebe - an outlandish friends that is hard to understand, but full of surprises. Rachel is presumably the beauty queen of the group pretty much likes to live easily and play with other people. Monica - the chef to the marrow: always want to be in control and loves perfection. Alone they sound horrible, but the beauty is in the fusion of all those unique differences.<br/><br/>While I was writing all of this, I realized that many moments are way more serious than you might think from the first glance. So my advice is not to give too much thought and simply enjoy the show. The best thing is that these friends will always be with you and will make you laugh whenever you are sad or just want to spend a fun time. Even after seeing every episode multiple times, I still laugh at some jokes. The characters mesh well together. If you're a millennial, you probably binge-watched Friends growing up (or later on via Netflix). Perhaps it was a sign of the times or a lack of self-awareness on the part of the writers, but many of the storylines, situations and characters on Friends were problematic.<br/><br/>While the six besties Ross and Monica Geller, Rachel Green, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Phoebe Buffay seemed like people you wanted to hang out with back in the '90s, you might change your mind in 2018. Storylines laced with homophobia, sexism, borderline emotional abuse and sexual harassment are portrayed as punchlines. The lack of diversity within its 10 seasons is inexcusable and embarrassing. Truth be told, several of the jokes written in the show that began 24 years ago probably would be thrown out before they even got into the writer's room.
Watch more<br/><br/>Millennials think Friends is problematic after watching it on Netflix<br/><br/>Recently, Friends was added to Netflix in the UK, and millennials were astounded by the problematic elements that persisted for 10 seasons. Below are highlights of the troublesome themes, moments and jokes that happened during the show's decade-long run.
When Ross voices his disapproval of Ben playing with a doll<br/><br/>Ross' ex-wife comes out as a lesbian and they always seemed to play up on that in the show in some way. In one of the ways it happens, Ross sees his son Ben playing with a Barbie doll. He exclaims, "Why is my boy playing with a Barbie?" Ross somehow manages to convince himself his lesbian ex-wife and her partner forced Ben to play with Barbies.<br/><br/>
In a plot that would be textbook sexual harassment, Rachel hired hot and simple 24-year-old Tag for an assistant job he wasn't qualified for purely because she wanted to date him. This was instead of hiring Hilda who met all of the requirements to be her assistant. Of course, Rachel and Tag end up dating until she breaks it off because he's too immature.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Don't hire someone because you think you'll want to date them!<br/><br/>When Joey is perceived as "feminine"<br/><br/>Joey seems to be the butt of everyone's jokes especially when he likes more "feminine" things. There's a whole episode dedicated to his love of his shoulder bag that is mocked as well as how he explains how he likes wearing makeup. Everyone makes a point of saying it's a "woman's purse," but it's just a shoulder bag. Chandler of course chides him saying, "Yeah, pulling flowers out of it makes the bag look a lot more masculine."<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Let people like what they like - don't be sexist!
When Ross couldn't handle having a male nanny<br/><br/>The male nanny plot line was played out distastefully later in the series. Rachel finds an extremely qualified male nanny, and they hire him. Ross takes every opportunity he can to mock the nanny, played by Freddie Prinze Jr, who is portrayed as extremely sensitive. The way the nanny was presented was extremely stereotypical and Ross' reaction to having a male nanny was sexist.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Avoid stereotypes and sexism!
When Monica was fat shamed<br/><br/>One of the most consistent themes running through all 10 seasons of Friends was fat shaming Monica. We get it: Monica was overweight in high school. But Monica's weight is a relentless punchline that is offensive. Joey memorably yells, "Some girl ate Monica" in a video of Monica in her prom dress eating a sandwich while prepping for the event. Monica's friends never let her forget about her time as "Fat Monica," as if it's shameful.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Don't body shame others!
When Ross became an obsessive and controlling boyfriend<br/><br/>In retrospect, Ross and Rachel's relationship is 50 shades of toxic, but that's mostly because of Ross. His behaviour is borderline emotionally abusive when you look back on it. He essentially stalks Rachel while she's getting lunch with her friend Mark because he doesn't trust that they're just friends. It becomes a through line for an overarching story for the season and even comes back for a minute in season 10. While his behaviour was seemingly all laughs back then, it was uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Trust your partner!
When Chandler interacted with his transgender dad
Friends scene sees Chandler's father attacked for gender non-conformity<br/><br/>It's no secret there was an underlying homophobic and transphobic tone to Friends, but particularly with the character of Chandler. Chandler's mom - played by Kathleen Turner - is a transgender Vegas drag queen, something he's constantly embarrassed by throughout the series. She is a punchline who never gets referred to with the right pronouns -- Chandler also loves to mock the fact that she wore dresses. The gang doesn't hold back about questioning the part Chandler's dad has either - something that is super invasive.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Be inclusive and respectful to everyone - don't be transphobic!
When there were only two people of colour in the show<br/><br/>
It's hard to think about diversity when it comes to Friends because there really wasn't any. The closest the cast got to diversity was when Ross dated Julie who was Asian and later in the series when he dated Dr. Charlie Wheeler, who was black. The Friends cast and guest stars were all extremely white.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Promote diversity in casting!
When Chandler was paranoid of people thinking he's gay<br/><br/>Throughout the series, Chandler is always hypersensitive to people thinking he's too feminine or of being perceived as gay. People mistaken Chandler for being gay and it's lauded as something to be ashamed of in the show. In the episode when Monica and Ross' nana dies twice, Chandler finds out people assume he's gay, which doesn't sit with him well. This combined with his mom makes him an extremely insecure, homophobic character who always feels the need to defend his sexuality.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: I repeat: don't be homophobic!
When Ross dated one of his students<br/><br/>In his Paleontology class, Ross gets an anonymous letter in a survey from one of his students that showed she had a crush on him. Ross somehow thinks that dating said student (Elizabeth) is only "frowned upon" and is then shocked to find out it could actually get him fired. But that apparently doesn't matter because they're so into each other that they hide their relationship from the faculty.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: Sneaking around is a sign you shouldn't be doing something - don't date your students! Every single detail about this show is timeless. I promise you, you'll end up watching friends time and time again . Watch all 10 seasons, then watch them 10 times again. Take any show ever created in the world
How many times will you Binge watch all episodes of all seasons?
You'll be bored after a point .
This Doesn't Happen with F.R.I.E.N.D.S
Rewatch Engagement of this show is unparalleled.
Nothing comes closer to this one on the scale.
To be honest; it's the Simple Humour and Clean Narrative and the Bond each character shared did all the magic.
Trust me, people talk about this show as if it's still being freshly Aired on TV
No show has ever gotten this response, even though the show ended Years Ago.
Kudos to the Team.
Nothing will ever beat this Show This tv series deserve to be number 1. You cannot watch anything else like this. The cast's perfect. The jokes that was made throughout the series is perfect, as well. This show is a feel good show that always cheers you up and brings out a laugh. You can relate to the characters and their issues and It's just a very chill and good show overall. The actors are and characters are great as well! For my opinion "Friends" will remain the best sitcom of all the time,you get addictet to it. I've been wanting to write a review for Friends for so long. But I'm afraid I won't do the show justice.<br/><br/>You either like it or not.<br/><br/>I will never understand how people can not find this show funny. How that is possible will forever be a mystery to me.<br/><br/>This show is truly amazing. I've rewatched it about 8 or 9 times in probably 14 years. And I never get bored. This show always brings emotions, you laugh, smile and even cry a bit.<br/><br/>The characters and the writing of the show is so well put together. I've never ever seen a show similar to this. When it comes to the humor and characters. Everyone is so likable in certain ways.<br/><br/>And still they annoy the living out of you. Which most people will relate to, either it's your friends or your loved ones.<br/><br/>This show will always have a special place in my heart. And so will the characters of the show.<br/><br/>No one will ever be able to make a show like this ever again. That's the saddest part. And the good is that we can all rewatch it.<br/><br/>The final episode is almost to painful to watch. And yes I'm probably too emotional writing about this show. But words can't explain how much joy and happiness I feel for this show.<br/><br/>What we truly learn about this show is how
Much friends mean, could mean,
And could be. We watch the characters trough they're everyday life, growing up, having fun, changes, having difficulties. Changing their careers. Having kids and getting married.
They always stick together and support each other. The circle of life viewed trough a comedy that truly sticks with you.
The hardest part is seeing the characters moving on with life. Getting older and finding their own path.<br/><br/>Usually we have this picture in our young minds that we won't change to much, we won't end up like our parents. We'll just stay young forever. But in the end we end up becoming that one you feared or the path takes you places you never knew existed, for you that is.<br/><br/>Like life, Friends came to an end. The group splis in a way, moving on. And moving away from each other. Starting life.<br/><br/>If you have friends similar to these ones, consider yourself very lucky. And keep them close. Certain friendships definitely changes but they don't all have to end.<br/><br/>And luckily this show shows us how some bonds are worth having in your life. Whether you live close or not. They will always be there for you.<br/><br/>Anyways. The best show made till date.
There will not be another show like this ever, even if they try to make a reunion episode. Hats off to the writers also who make the cast seem to look like what they want to be seen as. Seriously the best show ever made!! Every episode will make you laugh, each character is funny in their own ways.. It has been over 20 years since being released and is still better then majority of the new stuff being made.. Watched it like 100 timesðŸ˜‚ if you have a kid or a teenager your going to love this Greatest TV show! All casts were amazing. Their chemistry was improving every season. Let's not forget the show creators Marta & David. They created this great show. I liked it. What's not to like - their chemistry: good, their acting: good, the jokes: gooood. I remember being in my early 20s when the show premiered and couldn't wait. When I saw the first few episodes I knew this was something special. I am now binge watching with my teenager, and had forgotten how great this show was and still is. The writing is brilliant comedy at the top of its game and consistent throughout every season. Along with the cast who brought their A game every week with great chemistry and comedic timing.. Glad they went out on a high note at the perfect time. No reunion or reboot necessary! Based on a group of friends who well basically do everything together, the way he show has been made is a masterpiece, love and relationships, children and life best show for when your bored and you have just broken up. MUST WATCH Absolutely love the friends episodes there are the best. Great acting and the storylines are so funny can not stop laughing. Just feel good light hearted comedy to watch over and over again all I can say if u have not watched it then do it will change your life Perfect just perfect tv series ever 10/10.all characters are incredible Going through the whole series on Netflix even though I own the box set. Mainly because it's so addictive. And also because they're almost like your own friends.<br/><br/>Revisiting this 25 years after it first started is almost painful in the personal memories it brings back. Some of them good, some not so good. As you go through each episode you can't help remembering who you were (or thought you were) back in 1994, what you were doing or what you should have been doing. And then here you all are, together again in 2019.<br/><br/>For the most part it still holds up and it's still funny although to me Phoebe does not age well: what seemed cute back then now comes across as annoying, arrogant or just plain dumb/borderline retarded. Until later on in the show where she starts to become quite endearing.<br/><br/>Also the amount of times Joey and Chandler bicker like children is a little annoying not to mention cringe.<br/><br/>Other thAn that it's still good solid fun. One of the best shows ever created beleive it this is greatest of all time so sad it has toend like all the good things this star cast never failed to entertain I have watched this series 4 times and In my life I have never seen anyone who has watched this and not loved it.I have recommended this series to a lot of people and most of them were skeptical at first but after watching it they would keep telling me how much they have laughed and loved it.If you don't watch this before you die you're gonna regret it. I watched it 3 times and every time more then the once before my best character is chandler It's best comedy we have ever seen.
And just sometimes we remember their dialogues and laugh again and again I can't stop laughing. so funny and emotional .I can't get enough. Best show ever, re watched the episodes a thousand times and still laugh exactly the same as the first time. Can't beat friends! Best, ever best ever best ever best ever
Funny , u need to watch it It is so good that I finished it 5 times. It never gets old Friends is the best sitcom I have ever seen. I watched all ten seasons multiple times and plan on doing so again in a couple of years.<br/><br/>Here's what's so great about it:<br/><br/>1. Great characters
Who wouldn't like to have friends as good and diverse as this? Yes, they're all white. But remember that Friends began at a time when it wasn't considered a neccessity to at least have a black, an asian and a gay character in the same show. I can't imagine a person who can't relate to at least one of the characters.<br/><br/>2. The balance
Friends is quite often simple fun, sometimes it's emotional, sometimes it's almost depressingly sad. But somehow the writers always managed to clear the air with a laugh at the right moment.<br/><br/>3. Friends takes its characters seriously.
Sure, it makes fun of them as part of the comedy but every character also has its honest, heartfelt moments without seeming forced.<br/><br/>4. The guest stars
Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, JCVD, Elle MacPherson, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Danny de Vito... The list goes on.<br/><br/>5. The 'quotability'
Me and my friends still use many phrases, jokes and references from Friends in our every day life. Here are just three examples.
'My girlfriend's a lesbian.'
'Joey doesn't share food!!'
'We were on a break!'<br/><br/>6. The writing
Although the show went on for 10 seasons, it didn't feel too repetetive. In my opinion they found a good time for the end of the show. Some storylines feel similar but never bore me. I don't know how they did it, but they did.<br/><br/>I subtract 1 point for the laugh track (never understood that...) and some best-off-episodes consisting mostly of funny moments from previous episodes (no-one needs that!)<br/><br/>Other than that, perfect entertainment! It is the same show and the more you watch it the better and funnier it still have the same humor and jokes I love it Back then Friends was the Nonplusultra. A new Genre of Sitcom that worked on a lot of levels. But the thing is that if you make something new, there are a lot of mistakes that you can make. Others will watch it, learn from it and make it better. Don't get me wrong Friends is great and it's cool nostalgia but a lot of episodes are boring fillers. And sometimes the series will try to be funny or cringy so hard, it really hurts. It can't keep up Compared to HIMYM for example. Even knowing that the newer sitcoms really stole a lot of ideas from friends, they still do a better job managing the episodes and keeping the characters interesting. If there would be 5 episodes less every season and a better more interesting storyline in the later seasons it would be truly a 10/10. This review sounds very negative, but i think Friends is a great show. This is just me trying to explain why i can not give 10* People who give less the 10 rating for friends.
Don't trust them they have zero knowledge about television ðŸ˜… ... anything they say is a Moo PointðŸ¤£ Love is the only thing I have ever done before and it was my fault I had This series is the pure definition of "comedy" .
This is an classic show of friendship drama and comedy . I love the Joey character . Overall the best comedy show ever This series is the best entertainment and comedy and all the characters containing in series all have given the best role they can perform. I can't say words words can describe this Series is so great the characters Joey , Chandler Monica , Ross , Rachel is so so so great I have watched both series Andy obviously friends is worth watching I really dont wanted the show to end.Its a real stress reliever No words can describe how thankful I'm , Friends really helped me to get over a lot of tough time.<br/><br/>Could it BE any more beautiful? I could write so much but this is the only show I can watch over and over again. It's the perfect situational comedy, timeless and perfect. Thank you Great show, great characters, great acting.
My Peraonal Favourite.
This show is the definition of a sitcom, a true comedy with great relatable characters, characters that you will love and would want as your F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Great acting by the cast, and even after watching each episode multiple times it will make you laugh out loud like you are watching it for the first time.
Those who haven't watched it, watch it, you won't regret it & those who have, continue watching it again and again, you will love it. The best comedy I've ever seen.
I've seen the show three times.
Every time I watch it, it's like I'm watching it for the first time.
I was so touched. After 15 years it will still be my favorite show to watch, the one and only one no one can copy This show changed my mind and my life.it became a very sweet part of my life.tanks marta and david and fantastic 6. This is honestly the best show EVER!! It's a light hearted and hilarious take on all the problems of the twenties: careers, falling in love, messing up and so much more. This show will forever have my heart and I find myself coming back to it frequently for just some no nonsense laughs. Do yourself and watch this series, and I garuntee you will have a new fave show! This show, when it debuted nearly 25 years ago this fall and ended nearly 15 years ago with a memorable finale, remains a gold standard for comedies on TV. You can find it on network tv as well as on netflix and still have a crush on the characters. There have been attempts to spinoff the characters such as Joey, but to little fanfare. Friends is a show full of whitty humor, fun characters, heartbreaking moments, and awkward situations. From the airing of its first episode in 1994, up to last episode in 2004, writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman found ways to keep audiences captivated, Humor, brilliant set designs and the wildly ordinary lives of Joey, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Phobie, and Rachel are what kept us all watching.
Thanks to the creative writing style of Marta Kauffman and David Crane, Friends quickly became a fan favorite. Many of the iconic phrases they used throughout the show fall may somewhere in your vocabulary today. Phrases like, "we were on a break," "how you doin?" and worst of all, anything that comes out of Janice's mouth. We can all her her voice now, "CHANDLER BING," and "Oh. My. Gawwwwwwwd." Kauffman and Crane were brilliant writers, their ability to adapt and come up with new fresh ideas is what kept Friends alive. The two writers spent a lot of their time during shooting tweaking their writing to the crowds reaction. If they didn't get the reaction they were expecting, Kauffman and Crane would turn to the audience and ask for input. They turned to the cast members, particularly Matthew Perry aka Chandler, for suggestions as well. Many times the those suggestions made it to the final cut of the episode. This was their way of ensuring that everyone was enjoying the show.
Kauffman and Crane's writing was fantastic. Their writing however, was not the soul reason Friends was as successful as it was, people like the writers who helped Kauffman and Crane, editing teams, cameramen, light guys, boom operators, and the set teams. These amazing groups of people mad it all happen and brought writing on a paper to a ten season tv show. Just as iconic as the character of Friends are, some of their set pieces are equally as iconic. When thinking of Friends, there are a couple pieces in each set that one might recognize, the orange couch from the coffee house Central Perk, the foosball table in Chandler and Joey's apartment, the picture frame around the the peephole in Rachel and Monica's apartment, and even the bizarre 3D framed picture named Edna that floats around from time to time. These things, along with others you may be thinking of, enhance the aesthetics of the show and draw your attention to the sets and what is happening around the characters. When you see these pieces, you know exactly where the characters are. This, along with good camera work are another reason why Friends, more than ten years later, is still loved by many. But arguably, the best part of the show are the characters.
Ross, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Pheoby, and Rachel are 6 iconic names that made Friends into the show it is today. Writers Kauffman and Crane made these characters relatable, friendly, and funny in order to gain fandom amongst all crowds. From the controlling behavior of Monica, to the corky dad like humor of Chandler, everyone has someone they feel they closely relate to. The choice of actors for Friends could not have been any better. With Jennifer Aniston aka Rachel, being the most popular of the bunch, all have been able to go onto different acting jobs and perform very well in various roles.
Friends has been off the air for over ten years now, but the humor is not lost on us. We use their language, we recognize their names, and we see their talent. For its time, and even for today's standards, Friends has earned its spot in history with all the other great movies and TV shows Roger Ebert said were, "two thumbs up." I loved the story more than their jokes and how the relations get deeper and not everything have a happy ending The actors are high level, and they defend the script pretty well.
Credits deserves to the script writers too. Probably they had some kind of source of real incidents, and after process turn them into very funny situations.
This sitcom have also very stable quality over the seasons, and duration. Still broadcasted till today, decades after its termination.
I would like to thank all those which contribute to Friends, and add some happines to our life!
My last wish is Friends the movie. Will be interesting to see the funny perspective of Friends get aging. I WILL BE THERE FOR YOU!! IMDb genre of this tv show is drama and romance but it is more than that it will teach you the real friendships goals, love between best friends.<br/><br/>I think the best sitcom i have ever watched. Really so much to understand from this series, even after around 15 years, like how to spread love , how to take care of our loving people and most importantly how to live life without being sad. Just always be happy no matter what is the situation.<br/><br/>Special mentioned for that best bond between chandler and Joey. They both are settling some another level best friendship goals. Every character has something to teach. Very well written, fantastically directed and fabulous acting of these six chandler, monica, joey, ross, rachel, pheebe.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this yet then go and watch if you don't then you are so so gonna regret it<br/><br/>Every character is different from each other like,
Joey : how you doin
Chandler : funny and sarcastic jokes
Ross : dinosaur stories and crazy
Monica: cleaning and cooking
Rachel: shopping and sensitive
Pheebe: funny songs, emotional and cazy This series literally carved out an enclave, a niche as the best television decade in the history. All this time, it made me laugh out loud, I had never thought that it would make cry towards the end ... Yes I spent nights crying over the fact that show is ending... I took that it really was a reality parallely existing and that these characters felt so real, near and adorable that I was lost in its awesomeness. Never in future again a show so lovable will be made. Friends is one of the best sitcoms of all time if you haven't already seen Friends then stop reading this and watch the first episode you will not be disappointed by it you will find a part of yourself in one of the six friends will you be a Joey a Ross who knows but soon you'll begin to wonder how you lived your life without Friends until now. I mean what can I say about Freinds? It's the best comedy show from the past and people still watch it. Im very thankful that I saw it and will never forget this Masterpiece. This show is simply great. Very original. Very funny. Super talented actors, especially the boys. This show gets me through my hangovers and heart aches :) Friends is a TV series that shows the reality of six very close friends, they are Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, Rachel e Phoebe, over 10 years it shows the daily life and what is happening with each of them in different areas, The show caught me from the very first episode, for example, right at the beginning, there are crisis in the lives of the characters, with a more critical situation in Ross and Rachel's life, both of them had just break up their corresponding relationship, they search for their friends' help, who were in the cafeteria where they hang out and share their crises and everyday experiences.
Another interesting aspect in the series, in my opinion, is the love relationships between the friends, because it shows that the basis of all good relationships starts from friendship and trust in one another, the series also tells the story of overcoming the 3 characters because it shows different personalities, conditions and problems, but with positive results, starting with Phoebe who grew up on the streets without a good family structure, but struggled and overcame her obstacles and had success, Monica who in adolescence suffered from obesity but with her competitiveness managed to control herself, lose weight and get a healthier life, the story of Rachel is the opposite of Phoebe, for she grew up in a house, together with her family and with a great financial condition, but she discovered that she had grown up and yet totally depended on her parents for her livelihood, but with the help of her friends and willpower, she overcame all her pride and grew in the area professional, family, and moral.
Friends is a combo of reality, comedy, drama, and many life lessons, which make every second worth watching. I want to say this shows subject shortly: Rachel Green's grown up. In the first scene Rachel was came the Coffee house with wedding dress she is little perky and silly. And she is became manager and she have responsible. I was first season hate from her but next to time i love Rachel. But my really really favorite character is Chandler Bingg!! I love his sarcasm and joke!When my life goes the bad my first job is watching random friends episodes. Never gets old, fantastic writing !
Nothing like it on tv ! Sitcoms are all American cheesey crap - this was relatable The most incredible series I have seen and I believe one of the best ones that exist. You have to see it, you will love it!!!!! The script was impressive. Comedy was on point. Casting was done perfectly, looks like the actors are born for their roles. I always respect how they ended friends, not too many seasons or too less just the right amount of seasons. Sometimes I still watch friends and never gets bored. However, the final seasons were not that perfect like the previous seasons but it's still better than any other sitcom. You just can't get enough of this show once you have watched the complete series. You will just keep on going back to it. I Love this show that show make laugh and in the end I feel so sad Monica Chandaler should not move in country. .. I'm really sadddddd like really sad It's really one of the kind!
Everytime I feel sad or depressed I just watch it and I got that great high mood again I like it too much . Its such a wonderful series I enjoyed it a looooot but When it ended it was sad it mad me so happy and laugh it was hard watching the last episode A timeless wonderful comedy that I never get tired of I grew up on Friends, and no matter what other people say it will always be my all-time favourite. To this day, Matthew Perry's Chandler is one of my favourite characters ever. He is frustrated, sarcastic yet a kind soul. I recommend this series to everyone, the episodes are nothing more than 21 minutes and 10 seasons. Just a perfect match for this year's holidays! THE WRITING / ACTING IN THIS SHOW IS OUT OF THIS WORLD ... IV'E NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE ... EVERY EPISODE IN EVERY SEASON IS GUARANTEED LAUGHTER ... THE GREATEST COMEDY SHOW EVER The Series titled 'Friends' provokes us to do the unnatural; to communicate the past. This series is a featured TV show but the unlikely coincidence is that the show in it's entirety in it's past glory of the nineties is a 'Pass Down.' The achievements in cinematography is off the unusual: people laughing in the background. 
The visuals and success are combined with the cinematographer; solid steady camera movements and lighting effects that are enhancing the actor's like Jennifer Aniston's comedy. This comedy series became a success and is a featured TV Show in our residences; 'When it hasn't been your day or month or year' as the song promo goes. 
The writer's block if there has been: ten seasons with the pay of the actors increasing at record breaking consistence with the TV Show 'Friends'. The tunes and the sarcasms and dirty jokes are typical Hollywood with the physical achievements of remaining aged the decade. 
By mastering Cinematography with acting like Jennifer did: lens and filters are unseen but humor succeeds. Then the visual stimulus or Television Show is a work of achievement with their 'studio' apartment standing the test of time; ten years in cinematography and acting.
The show has ASTONISHED US WITH HUMOR for the following fourteen years from two thousand and four finale. This is absolutely the best show tv has ever made! I thank God for the reruns that are still on. My husband thought it was a girly show but now I catch him dying laughing and watching it with me lol... I LOVE comedies and I watch so many comedie series like modern family, how i met your mother, new girl, Brooklyn 99 but NOTHING compares to friends!! The best thing about this serie is that it's for all ages! I'm 16, my mom is 43, my dad is 51, my grandma is 68, my grandmother is 88 and we all LOVE IT! 
The acting is outstanding and you get addicted to the characters! 
And you wil laugh at least 3 times in every episode! <br/><br/>You have Chandler: sarcastic and tries to be funny, and succeeds bc his jokes suck. Phoebe: is funny without knowing it, is a little bit crazy with a big heart. Monica: the mother of the grupp and keeps everyone together and has a little bit of OCD. Rachel: a little bit spoiled, shopping maniac, has the sarcastic bit like chadler and a sucker for romance. Ross: the nerd of the group and thinks he's the man all women want. Joey: the guy all women actually want. He's kinda stupid but has one of the biggest hearts of the group.<br/><br/>This is gonna be a classic for eternity!<br/><br/>You're gonna get addicted after the first episode, I promise! So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
Or even your year, but
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)
You're still in bed at ten 
And work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast, so far 
Things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought 
You down to your knees and
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)
No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows 
What it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
Or even your year
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too) Never gets old never boring, it is simply the best comedy show in the history . Perfection like Chandler like chandler Said. I recommend it to every one .
Note: if you don't watch it you're missing a lot. I took my time watching this show over an year, then binge watched the entire series in the last month. And I am not disappointed. Everything from the actors, to the set, to the jokes are on spot. The storyline, although linear, is well written and evenly paced throughout the show. To add extra spice, the parents of each characters add an extra flavor from time to time and those are the episodes that you will rewatch again and again. For 10 years, Friends made people laugh. When it ended, I was just a little kid, so I never watched it then. It's just the show that never stops making us laugh. It is hard to have the perfect Sitcom, but this was definitely it. It had it's moments that had us feel like the show was ridiculous and crazy. But, it always had a good story. The last episode made me cry, and I do not cry a lot. I recommend watching this. It is well known that this series can make anyone laugh at any given moment in a person's life at any episode. I admit, before watching friends I thought it was over rated, but the minute I started watching I got attached to the characters and to their lives. It doesn't only change your mood and make you laugh, but also engage in their lives from their most embarrassing moments and funniest to the most heart breaking one which some of us can relate to, you almost feel like you're friends with them. This series will surely increase your dopamine level. I've watched this show over and over again, and i must admit that the writers of this show thought of every single life many times. Best dialogs ever! It's full of comedy, drama, and everything else you can ask for in a sitcom. By far one of my most favorite shows. I can watch it over and over again. I don't think it can ever be replaced. I have re-watched Friends with my partner recently and we finished all series within 2 months, we couldn't stop watching and laughing despite of pretty much having seen every episode at least twice in the past!<br/><br/>The comedy and the characters are just fantastic and the humor doesn't get old. We've watched the series with different eyes now that we're also on our early 30s and felt we could relate even more with the characters and what they experience through their friendship years. <br/><br/>A tv masterpiece! It's hard to say, what not to love about this show. Everything in on point, and every season is different and interesting. The characters are equal and they all have their own stories. I love the chemistry between the six main characters and I think that is why the show kept its charm all ten seasons. And I love the fact that the characters grow up during the show, but they still stay true to themselves of what they are. <br/><br/>I watch the series at least once a year and I still laugh at the jokes. Sometimes I laugh before the joke comes, because I know what is coming next. At some point I thought that my favorites were Ross and Rachel, but actually they all are. I can't imagine the show without any of these. I remember reading somewhere that Chandler and Phoebe were supposed to be on the side, but I am so glad that they were as equal as the rest. The perfect combination of different characters. <br/><br/>I have watched Friends almost 20 years now and I know I am going to keep watching it till the end. Friends just lifts your mood, if you are down and they are like your own friends you know well. Friends is an American sitcom (1994-2004) that follows around 6 twenty-something best friends, 3 guys and 3 girls, who live in the same apartment complex in New York. They experience life together, fall in love, fall apart, and chase their dreams. Through the ups and downs, they're there for each other. I grew up watching bits and pieces of this show because my older sister grew up watching it and would play it on the TV and I'd sit with her. I never quite understood it of course because the witty humor was something I couldn't fully grasp, but it wasn't until I was about 11 years old that I watched the show from the very beginning and since then, I've had all 10 seasons on DVD and have watched the show countless times that I have it memorized like the back of my hand. <br/><br/>I want to discuss this show in 3 aspects: the script, character development, and storyline. I absolutely adore this show's script. The humor is ridiculously hilarious because of how clever the jokes are. The show is packed with joke after joke. It's not overdone and they make so many references that if you pick on, it leaves you cracking up. The scenarios the writers come up are funny because as outrageous and embarrassing as they can be, it's incredibly relatable. We've all accidentally embarrassed ourselves in front of our crushes or during a job interview because we were so nervous. We've all dealt with such ridiculous people that sarcasm is the only way we know how to deal with them. As for the character development, I've never watched a more diverse group of cast in regards to their background and personalities. Each character has their own sense of humor and they interact so well together and when one throws a joke, the other has a comeback. I fell in love with characters. I grew to love each of them so much. The storyline of Friends isn't one that drags on, unlike other TV shows. Like life itself, it's so hectic with so much going on all the time, and Friends takes you along these best friends' journey of life, through the happy and sad times, through the ups of relationships to the downfalls, to the death of a member to the birth of a baby, to the end of a job to the find of a job of their dreams, etc. <br/><br/>I always have something to criticize when it comes to a show, especially the endings of most. I usually get disappointed in how a show is wrapped up either because it was too sudden, with everything just coming to a halt or whether it was because it became boring and just dragged on forever. But with friends, all I can say is although even at 10 seasons I wish it was longer, the way the show came to end was beautifully, but appropriate. Not to spoil but after 10 years of the best friends' lives, they were ready to move on to the next chapter, to settle down and start a family. They weren't 20-somethings anymore finding love and jobs because eventually, they achieved all of that. They couldn't all cram in the tiny Manhattan apartment anymore, but that's okay, because they were ready to embark on the next chapter of their life, of course, still together. They're best friends for life. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this show an A because it has everything I'd love in a TV show. It's comedic, sad. It has love, and has practically every aspect of life and it only makes me wish the characters were real. That's how well developed they were, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Even after I finished, it's just the kind of show you come back to no matter what. It's so heartwarming and it makes you laugh your butt off and fills your heart with warmth. It emphasizes the importance of friendship and family and love. At the end of the day, that's what matters. I love that. F.R.I.E.N.D.S
I'm not going to say this is of the best!It is The Best Show ever,10 seasons,10 years,More Than 230 episodes and It's still the best!

F.R.I.E.N.D.S,I'll Be There For you Forever
No words can describe how much we love you One of the best sitcoms of history...Friends is the best TV show I've seen in my life.It has it all.Fun,Romance and a fantastic cast.You can't say who's funnier Ross,Monica,Rachel,Phoebe,Chandler or Joey because they all have their characterstics that made that different form each other.And the jokes are very easy to understand and super funny.You have 3 jokes for minute.Except for jokes Friends shows us romance and how is a real friendship .It is a fun TV show that you can see with your family any time.I recommend it to anyone. I can remember watching this show when it first came out and it was good them and its still good. It's starting to show its age and after watching the show a couple times over you start to see Ross as a jerk, he was an awful character. 
I mean, when Rachael had Emma, it was ok for him to date other people but he didnt want her dating others, he's just a controller and not a nice person at all. <br/><br/>i also love how this show is kinda still relevant to the dating scene. Worth a watch! I think Friends is the best sitcom ever. Its cast, its scenario, its humor... It is just so perfect. I can't even count how many times I have watched the whole series. There are six friends have completely different personalities from each other in series. Rachel is the sensitive and a bit avaricious one. Monica who is an old friend of Rachel is rigorous and stingy. Phoebe, a guitarist (incredibly talented), is the weirdest person in the series and also she is very helpful. Chandler is the one who always makes jokes (as Monica said "Joke joke joke joke") and I should say I still don't know what is Chandler's job. Joey ( or Ken Adams) is a little stupid. He loves food and women so much that he can't choose one of them to other. And the final one is Ross: Divorce man. He is a Jewish man and he is very obsessive about his turkey sandwiches. As you see characters are so original. And the actors make these characters alive. There are some specific parts that I remember about Friends: Janice, Marcel, Rachel's cat (although it is not a cat), Joey and Chandler's chairs and foosball table, Central Perk, Science Boy, Geller Cup, Hugsy, Rachel's dessert, "How you doin'?" and "We were on a break!" lines, Crap Bag, Ross' Armadillo costume, Lobsters, Unagi, Duck and Chicken, "Smelly Cat" song, Ugly Naked Guy, City of Gunthers, Phalange and more... Friends shows us that life can be surprising. It teaches a lot to us. But first it teaches us to love. I'm so thankful that they make me laugh and happy everytime I watch this series. This is I watch one of best sitcoms since I've seen ever. It made me burst out laughing when I watched. So my mom burst into door when I laughed,and said " calm down! calm down! okay. taking your neighobor into account." funny,I would alway miss an unreasonable old man in the show. In the cafe, in the kitchen,in the livingroom... ... this is life, definitely. Us lives sometimes are difficult or complicated, but everything will be ok, you will make a lot of money finally, you will have a girl you love her and she want you finally, you will have some so good brothers finally. l meet my life in the sitcom and it make me feeled life, make me loved life again. Friends is a show that is extremely easy to love the acting makes you feel as if you're part of the 6 Friends living in Greenwhich Village New York. For me this show gives you everything that a sitcom should give you there's romance plot twists and lots and lots of comedy no moment is too serious and if it is it's followed with a funny one liner. This show gives fans a program that they can watch when they come home from work or school and just be with the friends, I absolutely love this show and you'd be missing a lot if you don't give it a try. Chandler, Joey, Ross and Phoebe are great, Monica is annoying as hell and Rachel is a bitch. Best TV show ever created, cannot even be compared with How I met Your Mother and other sitcoms, it's just so creative and genuine that you wish it was like that in the real life. You better watch it. I'm reviewing so late because the friends is still popular even after 20 years I think it's an truly masterpiece show like no other and even my future kids will love this show if I show them because FRIENDS is as it's a reflection of our lives- a story of 6 20-somethings trying to find their way in the world, just like we are, and of finally making it. Their happy ending is the best happy ending anyone could ever ask for. The show may have ended, but the legacy will always remain. And that makes every FRIENDS fan ecstatic. Personally i don't think 6 characters in any other show could connect to the mainstream audience as well as friends has done. Sadly i wasn't a fan when the show was actually aired prime time, but once i got the hang of it, how well has it served me with immense emotion, humor and the moral sense of living on your own terms , independent on anyone or anything. It's influence on the India urban youth is downright grand, as everyone slips in Chandler's one liners or Joeys' 'How ya doin?' or Monica's unnecessary extravagant attraction to hygiene. It has so many run of emotions and having said that, it can still be watched exclusively for its humor. I can easily entitle this as one of the funniest shows on planet earth. I remember watching it in my college days on the bed since my parent slept in the hall and even if I watched it with my headphones my laughter would screw up my parents sleep. There are so many layers to every character. There's Rachel who is a poster child glamour doll who wants to make a mark on her own and be self-sustained so starts working as a waitress. There's Monica who is a cleanliness fanatic and also a Chef by profession. There is the latter's older brother Ross who has Phd and is a paleontologist having his own dinosaur fantasies. There's Joey who is the cool and funny guy of the lot who is really popular among the girls and also a professional actor who isn't really doing well. There's sweet and very unorthodox Phoebe who likes to sing pretty offbeat songs with her guitar and is a masseuse by profession. And finally my personal favorite Chandler who throws in cringy remarks in conversations that have so much subtle sarcasm and wit and his partnership with Joey brings up some of the best bachelor Comedy there is to offer on the silver screen. On a serious note the important content displayed is that the lives of these individuals are far from perfect. In fact there are run of events 
 that are outright sad and depressing, but eventually someone is always there for someone else and they hold on to each other in tough times.It's one show that will resonate through your life in various forms and the echoes will last your lifetime. I felt so sad about ending this amazing series and I felt lonely on the end of the last episode. It's show of friendship and family that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you. I have a lot of fantastic things to say about Friends but I think that are all well-known. SO All what I want to say that I'll miss you my friends so so so much. "Friends" deals with the lives of six very different characters in New York City that explore love, loss and many strange situations.<br/><br/>The series is pretty much the role model for many sitcoms that flood the market nowadays. Especially "How I met your mother" draws a lot of its ideas from several episodes here. Over the time you're easily bonding with the characters and get to know a lot about their personality, strengths and weaknesses. The series lives through a lot of carefully built up side plots and running gags and a lot of originality and creativity. Unfortunately, at least the German translation is really bad and the series loses almost all of its charm with it. Otherwise "Friends" nowadays is almost a legend in itself already and that for a reason.<br/><br/>All in all you should give this show a try, especially if you're a fan of "How I met your mother" and comparable sitcoms. Do yourself the favor and watch it in English, it will gain a lot through it. This is one of my favourite quotes of the series Friends. This quote is from Joey Tribbiani, he is one of the main characters and uses the sentence to get laid. Joey is one of the six friends in the series. The other five friends are Monica Geller, Rachel Green, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. The series starts with Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross and Joey in the coffeehouse when Rachel walks in. Rachel was Monica's best friends in high school. She is looking for an apartment, so Monica tells her she can live with her. After Rachel moves in, the stories of the six friends start. <br/><br/>I started to watch Friends since the first time I came across it on the TV. They were broadcasting the series again after all these years. From the first episode, I laughed and most of the time out loud. The jokes and the events in the series are funny and in case of the events most of the time weird, but sometimes also unexpected.<br/><br/>The series contains in total 236 episodes spread over 10 seasons. I would recommend the series to everybody. When I rewatched the series, I still laughed at all the jokes and situations. I think most of the people (if not everyone) could watch the series over and over again and laugh every time watching Friends. So I give the series Friends a nine out of ten. FRIENDS is one of the world best TV shows ever, it is ever living show. You can watch any of it's episode and won't get bored at all but you'll end up laughing out loud. God bless David and Marta for wonderful creation. Nothing in world can beat FRIENDS story line. Watching the last season does makes you cry.<br/><br/>Rachel and Joey friendship is the best, Chandler and Joey friendship is superb and Phoebe jokes are the best. Rachel and Poss couple is beyond awesomeness. Monica fits with all of five of them. BRAVO!! My whole lifetime I've been searching for a comedy about linguini. And Friends is perfect their pasta making skills are brilliant, however Joey eats all the pasta! And Ross is a deluctant character always showing a brilliant performance equal to his in Band of Brothers. But there is one major plot hole and that is Janet, she is irrefutably the most hated character. However she is the enemies only true friend. <br/><br/>Thank you for your celery questions? I started watching this show to improve my English, But it is really funny show And great actors really make it more special. I am really attached to the characters. I just watched the last episode of the series that made me sad. I just wanted to appreciate the show that's why I am writing my first review on IMDb. Okay,so it is not a genius work of art. But it is a genius entertainment loving show. It took me the first maybe 3 episodes to get to know the characters which makes every episode even funnier. It is important to get to know them (not a very hard thing to do, since they don't have many layers). It is a sweetest show, that will make you laugh and cry, and laugh laugh laugh. It is the only TV show I bought in order to be able to watch more than once. It is hilarious. Oh, and romantic, which for me is always a grabber. Don't watch it if you're too much into serious. A must watch for the rest. Hope they make a match anytime soon!! My husband and I are re-watching this series from the beginning on Netflix and we are loving it just as much as when we watched it as newlyweds. The characters are still as much fun as we remember and it's been great revisiting the episodes we remember and many that we don't. We are currently in the midst of the Rachel/Ross love journey and I do recall getting a little tired of that while watching the series originally. I also had forgotten how beautiful Courtney Cox was at that age. So I have been watching this show from TWO yrs now,I've watched each and every episode for at least FIVE times and believe me,i still love it. What makes friends so beautiful is how wholeheartedly it is written and performed.Its all about love and laughter,10 incredible seasons of love and laughter. Other shows like Breaking Bad,Dexter,got etc are fantastic too,but this one affected me the most. Go watch and it will change your life for good. Not only is this TV series hilarious, it also refers to society's major problems in a comedic and unique way, without seeming as if they are violently preaching but more gently spreading awareness. In many episodes, there are events that the main characters experience that are not widely accepted by many societies. They make reference to homosexuality, chronophilia(?), problems within the micro world, conflict between differing belief systems, feminism, and many other topics. The TV series is bold and is not afraid of the possible negative outcomes from referring and "making a joke" of problems within society, that is the reason of why it is so amazing.<br/><br/>If you'd love to relax and watch something without having unrealistic story lines and garbage acting shoved down your throat, then I highly recommend "Friends". I know that i have waited so many years after i decide finally to watch it .. guys really for all who see this review .. this show with every single episode touch my soul ... i felt with every moment of it ... Monica who Taught me how to be strong organized a good hosted and well how i yell to my friends ,,,Chandler who Taught me how man with that sense of humor have so much feeling maybe he didn't have so much time for showing it but he did it ,,, Tribbiani Oh Tribbiani how much i laughed from all my heart that kind of person if you have it you mustn't leave it "he or she totally loves you" . Phoebe.. god know how much make me smile when she said something funny and she hide that little smile and that song smelly cat it will not be forgotten ... Rose who Taught me OH dinosaurs and love make some real difference in this life :) .. and Finally the One and the only one who i loved and i will be always in love with her "Rachel" ... i wish and i really mean it that some day maybe they can reunion together just for more another episode .. and i wish that one day i wish ... oh i just i cant say it ,, i wish i meet them some day ... I love you guys you made and you will make every single day of my whole life.. ENJOY the Show :) This show is the funniest and best sitcom that I have ever seen. The jokes and plots are written perfectly and even in 2015 it doesn't get old and still is as funny as it has always been. The actors were perfectly picked and you get one of each: Ross, the well educated professor and divorce "addict", Rachel, daddy's girl that is not used to work hard for her money, Monica, the super-organized cleaning freak, Chandler, the shy guy that makes jokes when he is uncomfortable, Joey, the handsome actor that already has slept with every hot girl in NY at least once and Phoebe, the weirdo who surprises us with another crazy story from her past in almost every episode. I have to admit that I do not like the show in German, as the synchronization is just the worst and the jokes are not at all funny and are translated totally different than the originals. I have already watched the show in English at young age, so I got used to it quickly. It was summer when I had watched the pilot episode of this show. During that time, I think I have also found six friends in my life who really know how I feel, how I'm doing and how I struggle in life. So the series goes and the gang found a reason to change who they used to be. We have witnessed their challenges, their sacrifices, the love that was lost and found, and how they coped with it by the help of each other. Ibthink it's the strength of the show. 6 awesome characters and a perfect scriptwriting. FRIENDS knows how to depict the reality of twenty-something's life by adding comedy to it (though there will be a really dreary moments in which you can't help the Niagara falls flowing from your eyes). But there are also moments when they can drive you crazy by making you cry like a baby and cackle at the same time. For the past ten years (10 months to me), FRIENDS really captured my heart and teach me countless lessons in life that I will truly treasure for the rest of my existing. This is the ONLY show that I think I will watch for nth time. I am really gonna miss this. It feels like I lost my friends. The grieving feels like death. Amazing friends, with their amazing antics. And there comes the nostalgic feeling again. It's so hard. They were more than characters. They became our Friends. I can't let you go Phoebe Joey Chandler Ross Rachel Monica. I will be forever thankful. *sighs One of the most significant TV shows of all time. And yes it is now 20 years old TV show. Almost every single episode is brilliantly done. The storyline is so strong it can compete with any other TV show that is running on TV today. Whenever it's a dull or boring day, just place the DVD and enjoy the perfect. Or even on any day this show is perfect to make you smile. The commitment and bonding of 6 Friends are so strong even today they are still friends of thousands of people around the world. So it's definitely a MUST WATCH TV show from my list. And trust me it will never be boring. <br/><br/>My Rating after watching FRIENDS thousand times would be 10 out 10. Friends has to be one of the best sitcoms ever made, i just love it! I own them all in a box set and i just have to put one on and im instantly uplifted. Its so funny, the script is just amazing and all the actors play their characters so well, you really believe that it is true life and you really feel for the characters and the situations they all go through. From watching the show from the start to the end i really feel like i have grown up with them and gone through their journeys with them. Its just the best show and i love Chandler so much, he is just so funny and witty, they are all amazing in their own light. Well done for making one of the best things on t.v, i don't know what i would have done without growing up watching it. 10 out of 10. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a reason this show stayed 10 years on prime time, continued going strong til this day and will keep on doing so into eternity! I was barely born when it started back in 1994 but once I learned to read the high-speed subtitle I was stuck. It only got better and better and the bond between me and my FRIENDS grew stronger and stronger. When given the opportunity I'm still eager to sit down 6pm, turn on Swedish kanal 5, and watch an episode. <br/><br/>The six genius characters pose the perfect humouristic combination of people. Rachel, the attractive fashionista, Monica, the pedantic chef, Pheobe, the slightly freaky girl you can't dislike, Ross, the classy nerd in love, Joey, the acting stud and Chandler, the funny guy whose occupation no one knows. You know them so well and in the apartments and the Central Perk they go through love, hate, relationships, break-ups, highs and lows. Thanks to the bang-on dialogue and world class acting all you do is laugh, sometimes so hard you just wan't to cry and pee your pants! And as if that's not enough there are moments so beautifully emotional you tear up and wipe your cheeks.<br/><br/>I demand you to enjoy! Love There can never be a better Comedy show than this one ever in the history of Television even in the future. <br/><br/>Everything about this show was top class. The actors, the characters, story, punches, everything. I have seen tons of sitcoms but I never had hard time in comparing them and finding out best because by default FRIENDS has been the best by miles. <br/><br/>I feel very sad that it ended but happy to see that it ended on a high note and made legacy and was not dragged more seasons to just kill it's Legacy like a few others which are done long time ago but still running.<br/><br/>I miss them lot but unfortunately that's all we can do. <br/><br/>Thanks for the memories folks. Contrary to my summary it did not make me cry when I was watching it, but when I watched the last episode of the show. This show is truly one of the best things that you can witness on TV. The actors are all hilarious in their own way and that just makes you love each of them for their uniqueness. <br/><br/>This show has been going for 10 years strong and I enjoyed it a lot. I managed to watch all 10 seasons in a bit more than a month. Unlike many shows they quit while on top and that is a very bold move and one that I respect.<br/><br/>So what did I do after I finished watching it? Well I re-watched all the ten seasons again of course :D Friends was one of the best shows ever. However, that being said, if you watch too much you will become critical. The first episodes are painfully awkward. The show does progress however. Rachaels hair goes from awful to beautiful while Monicas goes from cute to "Morticia" awful. As do her clothes. Ross is too pitiful in the beginning.Joey is probably cuter in the beginning, and after too many episodes I came to LOATHE him. Conceited, self focused and a big coward. Some of the best- The backpacking story,the playful pranks Rachel teaches Ben, Phoebe portraying Estelle, Monica and Chandler and the ink spot,(on the maid)...etc......so good.....However...JOEY is the worst character..mindless..self centered...and lets look physically....tiny feet and hands....truly an ugly body...eccch....his redeeming quality...HIS HAIR?.... I always liked Friends, I buy each season DVD, the day the release it but today's episode (5th Feb 2004) the one with Striper was disgusting where they show that late when Ross was in college, he kissed Monica (his sister) thinking she's Rachel.. How disgusting is that.. how can they show that and when there wasn't any need for that. When someone first introduced the series, I thought they were nuts. At first, it seemed like a mindless comedy with no meaning. As I grew up with the series airing, I realized that most of us can relate to some of the things that happens in real life; sibling rivalry, friendships, relationships, independence, etc. Every now and then, show has its' flair for drama (and at some cases showed some realism). Even through these serious moments, there would be a little humor to keep me amused and less 'upset' until the end of the program. At one point, the series (not mentioning which one) got a boring but somehow, the producers and writers managed to keep me glued to the screen and make me watch the episodes over and over again. For now, I rate Friends 4 out of 5.... This show takes some getting used to, and it's weird, uniques style of comedy may not be for everyones tastes! But it has many strengths that carry the show, and if you watch it for awhile, you will be hooked! The male actors in the show are great, and the individuality of each character always leads to great dramatic possibilities! The girls are not as funny, and lisa kudrows character isjust plain annoying! Still, once you get used to it, you'll find it is a great show! I love friends, its my favorite show after UK "allo allo".<br/><br/>My favorite character would be Chandler, without him show is no good.<br/><br/>I cant get enough of his sarcasm and jokes. My least favorite character is Monica, and i think many would agree with me. Just like many people im hoping for Rachel and Ross to stay together. Im still waiting for season 9 and its probably last season :(   but i wish that Friends could keep going forever. I started to watch the show just about one year ago and since then I can't let go to watch it all the time. The characters of this series are so well developed and unique, you really can relate to them. Also the actors make their character seem to be so natural, you just can't get enough of them. I just wished this show wouldn't be canceled in 2003, but instead go on forever! Guys, you're the best! This show is so wonderful!  I have watched it since the 2nd season.  This and Sex & the City are like my two soap operas.  Great Actors, great plots& so damn funny, you don't stop laughing.  I love it.  Watch it, you'll be addicted.  I have even starting referring to people like characters from "Friends".  My mother is a cleaning freak, so she's Monica, my best friend is so funny-he's Chandler, I'm spoiled, love to shop and have an attitude, so I'm Rachel.  Watch "Friends" and you'll start doing it too! Overrated show. So bored, didnt even laugh throughout. I don't understand how someone can laugh to this stupidity. At the opposite pole from Seinfeld. Worst show ever. Tries too hard to be funny. Rachel character is annoying as hell FRIENDS has to be the greatest overhyped garbage. Its unfunny, weak scripts. There is hardly any character specification or differentiation. The characters are mainly copy of one another. Its annoying. I will keep this short. Little needs to be said about a show I find this lacking in quality or imagination. As far as the reason for its success, I can only say that there must be a lot of people out there just as clueless as the writers and the six main characters on this show.<br/><br/>I have tried to sit and watch it, and I hear people laughing, but I can't for the life of me understand what they are laughing it. Am I missing something? Is there some sort of code within the language? Or do you have to completely shut off your brain to enjoy this show?<br/><br/>I suppose at this point you have already seen this show and either agree with me or disagree, but there are activities I would recommend much more than watching Friends, like having your teeth cleaned. It isnt seinfeld its a bad show its terrible i hate it so much sooooooo so much I started watching friends as a teenager and i thoroughly enjoyed it. However, my opinion changed as i grew older.<br/><br/>Friends is entertaining when you're bored and need a quick fix of comedy, one liner after one liner and the funny Chandler Bing (by far the best character) but the adolescent ways of the show made it hard to bare as i got older. Suddenly 20 and 30 something's were still acting like teenagers (when we'd all grown up)and everything was so superficial, always about dating, hair and this 'perfect' group friendship that rarely exists in real life.<br/><br/>The character Phoebe is unfunny and it's annoying that we have to suffer such dumb characters over and over again. Ross was a well drawn character, Joey wasn't and Monica and Rachel were OK but shout and squeal just a little too much.<br/><br/>After about series five or six, i stopped watching as plots involving Monica baking cakes got tedious and the on/off relationship between Ross and Rachel grew extremely boring.<br/><br/>Watch this if you like a quick laugh but go for the early 'good' series, when the characters had not all slept with each other yet. You can't go wrong with Friends, especially between series 1 and 5.
But there are certain things that haven't aged well. The look and feel of the show. The cultural diversity or lack there of. The fat shaming and attitudes towards being a lesbian. Don't get me wrong it's nothing malicious but it stands out like a sore thumb these days.
All in all though it's superb, fun and the 90s were a safer time we can escape to. One of the best sitcoms of all time. Not only the laughts and the story that hooks you for ten seasons, but also beacause your sitcom style (just like Seinfeld) influenced many current series.<br/><br/>Friends, overall, it's great, know addict the person to watch and enjoy a good comedy, often without much intelligence in the plot of the question (often), just jokes and funny scenes (yes, often forced, unfortunately), which make you laugh every time assists and retrace. As well as have their smart episodes, crucial (in a matter of history) or extremely touching, because of relationship it creates with the viewer.<br/><br/>Of course, this all depends on your liking style, a lot of people do not like Friends and i understand why. Everyone has a preference, often sets that are more focused on jokes and funny scenes do not like because they are not like the person. So it's nice that you identify with this kind of series, and if you identify yourself, and if you are not those who like that ridiculous strife between Seinfeld x Friends, is sure you gonna love Friends and will mark your life. Friends is a funny and witty sitcom with some intelligent humour and a couple well written plot sequences. Unfortunately the show is bogged down by one of the most irritating characters in any show in recent memory. Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston is constantly whining and complaining about the smallest of things. I'm aware her character is meant to be spoiled but there is a point where it ceases to be funny and is purely frustrating. But other characters are flawed as well. Phoebe is forgettable, and Ross's illogical eagerness to simply put up with all of Rachel's whininess is foolish. Chandler is easily the most deep and funny character although his depth is still nothing significant compared to other more modern sitcoms like How I Met Your Mother. In the end, Friends is a very funny show that stays consistently amusing throughout it's 236 episodes but falls short of greatness. While watching friends I use to always forget that it is a TV show and those are actors I'm looking at. They seem so real, every character in the serial was having its own personality different from others. <br/><br/>You get so involved in their reel life that you don't realize it is not real. I use to laugh with them, cry with them feel every emotion that came across to me. I liked Monica's perfectionism, Joey's innocence, Chandlers witty humor, Phoebe's unique imagination, Rose's efforts to prove his intelligence and Rachel's style. No one must have thought combination of all this can deliver a fabulous show with success like this. <br/><br/>Friends night was always a fun night, full of pure joy and laughter. Original sense of humor brought out so naturally that you will never think it was acted by these very good actors. <br/><br/>I must also appreciate the writer, director and crew that worked behind camera to make this show a huge success and bring FRIENDS on TV and in our living rooms. <br/><br/>Cheers to ALL !! This is one of the best series I've ever seen. I still remember the characters with their Friend's character names. We are also 6 friends, 3 boys and 3 girls and have named ourselves from the characters of Friends and I'm referred as Phoebe as People come to me with their problems :) I always wish that I stay with my friends forever as we see in the series. Its so much fun you hangout and have fun all the time. Yes, there are difficult times too but above all you guys are together always. Friends is not just a comedy series but you get to learn a lot. The sacrifice of Monica for Ross i love it.<br/><br/>Overall its all time no:1 entertainer. "Friends" is a show that I kind of got a late start with. The first time I ever watched it was when it was syndicated on Fox 5, right after "The Simpsons" (this was back in 1999); I was 14 at the time. I thoroughly enjoyed it back then for several years, but then lost interest in it. I'm sorry to say that I ever did lose interest. For a few weeks now, now at age 27, I've been catching more re-runs on TBS, and the show is just as funny and moving as it was when I first saw it back then. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer were the six Friends whose lives, loves, and laughs were chronicled over the course of a highly successful, 10-year run from 1994 to 2004. We laughed and grew to love these six characters - that some of us came to think of as family - and the crazy relationships and situations they often found themselves in. This is why we love "Friends."<br/><br/>10/10 Writing this review,at 2013 I still hope to meet those guys in real life and shake their hand for what they gave me.So much joy and happiness.<br/><br/>This show is about 6 best friends and their lives.<br/><br/>Six individuals Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer that were meant to play those roles.I can't think of any actors that would fit these roles better and I don't think there will ever be! Let alone the casting was superb,the script and those punch lines are still the source of TV-shows that try more or less to create something similar.<br/><br/>I can't express how much I love those guys and how much I miss this show but I can guarantee to all viewers that have not seen it yet,that you are missing THE BEST SHOW ever created! 10/10 and I really hope all the people that contributed to this to be as happy as they made us.Thank you! This is a show that I will treasure and will certainly pass on to my future children and grandchildren. I laughed, cried, hoped, dreamed and was inspired.<br/><br/>Never a dull moment. The script and actors are genius. It's a family.<br/><br/>The series is a mixture of sugar and spices of our life. It will make us laugh but then again will not forget to hark you back to reality. Lines were humorously delivered by each actor in their own way and character. Laugh out loud by Joey and Pheobe's out of the blue comments, Monica's obsessive-compulsive/meticulous reactions, Ross' fossil (serious) jokes, Rachel's "combo" lines (who would have thought that she can combine class and comedy) and of course Chandler being "CHANDLER". But in between these moments, the story will make you cry. It has shown how differences between personalities can make a gap between friendships, heartbreaking moments in a relationship and unfulfilled dreams and as well as how to build a bridge between relationship gap, rekindling love and striving harder for your aspirations. It's about friendship thru tough and happy times. It's about giving and receiving hope and sharing dreams. After seeing every episode of this much loved sitcom i much say that the writers and cast have succeeded in making something that is not only humorous, but also forces you to care about the characters and what happens to them in the future. All six of the friends bring characteristics to the show that make the viewer feel like they know them. Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode.<br/><br/>I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the show at series five but from then on i was hooked.<br/><br/>I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone. Friends is a true testament to what true friendship really is. Although I watch episodes in the dark at 2am continuously before I go to bed on youtube, and am thankful for no adbreaks, I really do wish that I was old enough in 1994 to have seen the episodes and at the end of every episode say to myself "it's only 167 hours and 30 minutes until the next episode". What was genius about the series was that the underlying storyline (obviously Ross and Rachel romance) was introduced in the pilot and not fully resolved until 235 episodes later? I don't think many TV series that are still going in 2009 could keep viewers in suspense for over a decade. <br/><br/>You really have to take your hats off stand up and give a long round of applause for all the directors, actors, make-up artists, editors etc who made Friends possible, it really is something that will last in the hearts and mind for a very very long time. One of the best shows ever i love the characters, they are all funny in different ways. I personally love chandler the most, but others don't agree for some reason. Just like the other day i saw a ranking (on Rankopedia.com) that said that Ross was the best character. I totally disagree, i mean he is funny and all but kind of annoying sometimes.... Anyways, brilliant show and definitely the best American show ever! It is amazing that it never got sold out, it was always a great show from the first ever episode to the last one, all of them were amazing. Maybe some better than others, but all really amazing! Non stop fun with 'Friends!' "Friends" is the TV show of a generation. Having rewatched all the episodes recently I was pleasantly taken back to my youth. In hindsight it's quite obvious why this show was such a success. Aside from the fact that all the main actors had an undeniable chemistry going on, the writers understood perfectly which fears and sorrows occupied young people at the time and incorporated them into the shows: fighting for independence from your parents and struggling to stand on your own two feet (Rachel), having to deal with your shyness and working in a job that you hate (Chandler), coming to terms with indifferent parents (Monica) or a troubled youth (Phoebe) or having to accept that your early attempts at starting a family already failed (Ross).<br/><br/>Of course, "Friends" was not a downer. These troubles where dealt with, but in a light way. The Friends always had each other and their youth. They had trendy haircuts and made hanging out at the coffee house the cool thing for a new generation.<br/><br/>The stories were charming, the jokes funny, if harmless. Maybe the show was a bit too clean cut at times (I'm referring to stuff like the inclusion of Hootie & The Blowfish), but then there were some naughty sexual references, too, especially in the early seasons.<br/><br/>Cleverly, the story lines were always adjusted to the age of the characters, so audiences could grow with Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel and Joey. "Friends" was always something the dedicated fan could identify him- or herself with. That's also why the show maintained its high quality for most of its run Â– with the exception of the tenth and final season, where the actors wanted to move on, pushing writers to wrap up the Ross/Rachel-storyline quicker than it could have been wrapped up.<br/><br/>Anyway, "Friends" has become a TV classic. It managed to capture the attitude to life of a whole generation. The final episode is very touching because when the Friends part it's like saying goodbye to a part of your own youth. Still, all things must pass, and I'm glad "Friends" ended on a very high level. Every generation has its TV show. This one is mine. In my opinion Friends is at the bottom of what I call the great four. Seinfeld ELR and KOQs then Friends.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this show is at the top of the list in sitcoms. It just doesn't make it to the apex.<br/><br/>I watched this show for many years and loved it. But its replay isn't that good.<br/><br/>I can watch ELR many times over. Friend just doesn't have the staying power for me as the other three.<br/><br/>Boy it seems like I am putting this show down.<br/><br/>I loved this show when it was new. And I watched a lot of replays until I had seen all of the episodes.<br/><br/>Maybe I am just burned out with it. This show is AMAZING! It's smart,intelligent,funny,popular,charming... It is just amazing how we fall in love with the characters and there odd situations. All of them are funny and unique in there own different ways. Rachel Green is the guy magnet and the "in your face" type of girl. Monica Gellar is the incredibly smart mother-type of character. Pheobe Buffay is the in a way stupid one which makes everyone laugh. Joey Tribiani is the little immature Italian kid actor sort of guy. Chandler Bing is the slow but positive guy who makes dumb look good. Ross Gellar is the very pathetic paleontologist nerd type of guy.<br/><br/>Friends shows the good things in life and makes us realize that friends will always be there for you. I say this is one of the best shows ever to reach television. What would television be without it. This show was my official start to the weekend; it was smart as well as hilariously funny. The show is based on thirty-somethings...who go through life together. There is no weak link within this group of actors, everyone plays there own roles with ease and the characters begin to develop throughout the series, as well as the writing; which only gets better as the years went on. All the characters are lovable and you feel for them when tragedy or heartbreak strikes.<br/><br/>The episodes that will always stick in my head are the Thanksgiving and Christmas episodes as well as the Halloween episode...This show is simply held together by the talented actors and the brilliant writers..Friends is simply the greatest sit-com ever made... Friends was, is and will continue to be the best show ever made. This is a simple and true statement about the most iconic television show ever to grace our screens.<br/><br/>Taking place over the 10 most important years of 6 young New Yorkers Friends takes you through the joy, heartbreak, shock and hilarious moments of Rachel, Ross, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe and Joey.<br/><br/>Set in Greenwich Village, Manhattan we watch Chandler the group's joker turn from a lazy single into a grown up family man. Joey, the struggling actor finally gets a break. Phoebe finds her family, and adds to it for her brother.<br/><br/>Monica, the young gorgeous clean freak finally finds a man who can stand her near OCD cleanliness needs and settles down. Ross, the smart Dr. with the Ph.D comes to terms with his family issues and finds the love of his life, even though it doesn't always work out. And of course Rachel, the beautiful Long Island Prom Queen breaks away from her father and his credit card and takes on life as a New Yorker, working for her money and taking life as it comes.<br/><br/>We watch as these six great friends fall in and out of love, have children, change careers, get married, in some cases several times, and live from there mid twenties to mid thirties. Friends was a fantastic show when it started 14 years ago, and will continue to be a classic for a very very long time. Nothing will ever match the hilarious, heart breaking, shocking and feel good story lines of Friends. I love Friends.It's very funny and it's perfect to watch alone or with your own friends.If you want to follow the series but you have never seen it before,you just have to know that(may contain spoilers):Monica was Rachel's best friend back in high school,Joey is an unemployed actor,Rachel and Ross are always wetting back together,and taking "breaks",Monica and Chandler get married in the 7th season,Ross get married THREE times(and get divorced three times too),Rachel and Ross have a girl,Emma,by accident in the 8th season,Rachel used to work in Bloomingdale's until the 5th season(then she starts working in Ralph Lauren)and that Phoebe's mother killed herself when she and her identical sister,Ursula,were 12.<br/><br/>hope it was useful for you It's a wonderful masterpiece. A must to see if you have 24 years and you want to have an advance of what will happen to you in the next ten. It's truer than a reality. It's amusing and sad at the same time. Especially if you have the same age of the protagonists and you have seen all the ten years in few months. You notice of how much the time that passes changes to you. And it is what you happens to they that do the magic. The magic for some minute to feel itself in New York and having to decide with six friends what to eat for the thanks giving. It's hard to write a ten lines comment especially if you don't speak English like an English but i wanted to leave my contribution about something that has left a sign inside me. Caveat: The Oxford American Dictionary defines "comedy," as "1. a light, amusing play, film, television production, etc. 2. the branch of drama that consists of such plays." Please note the absence of any reference to reality, realism, plausibility, etc. It has been awhile since I took a course on film criticism, but I distinctly remember something about the requirement of "suspension of disbelief." Does anyone else remember that too? For all of you who worship at the altar of Seinfeld, Frazier, Newhart, and Cheers (shows I also relish), I believe that the same criticisms you are making of Kauffman, Bright, and Crane can also be leveled at the good folks who created those shows.<br/><br/>What can I say? I am not even in the target demographic for this show. I am a 57 year old, male, professional...and I have seen every TV show from "Your Show of Shows" on to the present. This show ranks with the very best. The show did struggle a bit to get to Year 10, but still it was always funny...and the ensemble acting was as good as anything I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Aniston/Cox/Kudrow/LeBlanc/Perry/Schwimmer; all winners. OK, snobbish purists...denigrate the show all you want. Aniston is this generations Lucy or Coca...and I could make similar comparisons for all of the other regulars. I realize that it is just "too hip" to trash the show when, of course, you realize you are just "so far above that sort of thing," but you miss the point. It is funny. It ain't cerebral...it is just funny. Yeah, it has "Ca-Ca, pooh-pooh," and sexual innuendo, double entendre, and cheap gags,but it also has some great stuff. Who does a double take better(and more affectedly) than LeBlanc? Who is more ditsy (for a Vassar girl) than Kudrow. Who is more witty than Perry. Who has done her best and never gotten any credit than Cox? Who tops Schwimmer for Yiddisher humor? If you are searching for a documentary about the so-called "yuppy lifestyle," please turn on PBS.<br/><br/>Please do give us a break. We are all quite impressed by your effete sophistication and pedantry, but please, do drop your pretense and quit being so pompous! Just enjoy and have fun.<br/><br/>Many of you film snobs think you are the very incarnation of Roger Ebert. Well, sorry...the job is taken. It may shock some of you to realize that some of us watch TV shows because we want to be entertained, not edified, and we just want to feel good and laugh at Theater of the Absurd.<br/><br/>We are all really, really impressed with you cynics out there; with your trashing of this show. Can we BE more superior? I wonder how many of you have actually acted, or taken courses in television production? Probably not many. This show can be fun, even to people with a +3 Sigma IQ. If you can laugh at Oscar Wilde, or Monty Python, or Fawlty Towers...why not just open your mind and enjoy? For those of you who "hate" the show, please note that every single TV remote ever manufactured comes equipped with a rather large button (usually red) that makes mention of the term "POWER" or "OFF."<br/><br/>Just my two cents. i have been watching friends since i was 12 years old and now i'm 21 and still watch its repeated series... every single episode for me is a blessing .... :-) whenever I'm feeling down .... friends make me laugh !!!! <br/><br/>i remember i used to have a massive crush on both joey and chandler and up to this day i love them both for their personalty and comic acting <br/><br/>i love all of the characters in friends. Rachel - being the rich pretty girl next door. Monica - (She reminds me of mom so much) a obsessive cleaning freak!!!! Joey - who has no clue to anything except girls and food!!!! Chandler - who trys to act smart and also succeeds in it sometimes. Ross - the innocent and childlike man !!!! <br/><br/>i love friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why has friends effected so many lives and changed so many people over the course of ten years it ran? Why is it that Everybody no matter race, religion, way of life, however different we may be from each other friends seems to be the thing we can all agree on.<br/><br/>Friends is the life that we all want, it is the job that we live, it is the friends that we want and the problems that happen so often, and it is the way friends should be.<br/><br/>The show is so catchy and it has so many things in it that we take into our own lives. I mean how many guys after watching friends started to name there furniture, wanted a foosball table as there kitchen table, started to have a bedtime penguin pal, going through phases after breaking up with girlfriends? And Ladies, how many people after watching this started being clean freaks around the house, started to act as weird as phoebe, took shopping to a whole other level? We start looking at chandlers life and realize our parents aren't that bad, we look at Monica and realize well, at least my mother loves me! This show is personal to the creators and to the cast. Props, people names, problems, the casts backgrounds in the show, everything about the show has had a lot of thought thought and life experiences in it and they keep the same show from beginning to end. You can see episode 2 and then episode 9 and it will be as if the same. Technology, events, politics etc... it's all kept even throughout all ten seasons.<br/><br/>With over 55 awards and 150 nominations, the cast stuck together from the beginning to the end of the series all starting with $22,000 per episode and all ending earning over a million dollars per episode these 6 cast members and special guests and creators, producers and everybody who made it happen stuck together and made the show a part of there lives, and that is why this show is so great. If you have not had the chance to see it i strongly recommend you do. This is the best sitcom ever. It's about friendship, live and expectations. It is about staying true to oneself, and most importantly, it is about staying true to your friends. It's about love, hate, jealousy, obligations, deception, astonishment, it's about the wonderful feeling of friendship, over and over again. You got acquainted to the personages as if you'd know them personally. You come to recognize them as friend and you'd come to get personal preferences. You got into the game as if it were your own... I'd say it is the most true sitcom as it addresses the most fundamental human need: friends. It is not about fanzy life, not about action loaded scenes, it is about weakness, strength, love and loyalty. This is the best show ever. It's funny, etc. First, I didn't like it, because I never really watched it. But then I watched a few reruns in the evening, and I began to like it. When the show was started from the beginning again, I started following it and since then... I'm addicted to it. <br/><br/>Of course I think that some characters from Friends are less funny, or something, but they all make Friends. I hope they will make another 'Friends' with the same cast, and absolutely NOT with other actors in it. <br/><br/>Perfect show! You should watch it! Brilliant. Taken sitcoms to an all new level. Since it is a Character based programme, a lot depends on the actors themselves and I must say that each actor has done his bit and conducted himself perfectly. They actually make you believe that the characters are real and are your best friends too. They make you feel as if you yourself are a part of the GROUP. I must give it to the screenplay artists and writers too. Though it is a comedy series, it has a bit of everything including emotion, romance, etc. Season 1 was basically about when the audience gets to know as to what and who these friends really are. Rachel is a spoilt girl who belongs to a rich family, trying to make her way into the city. Monica is chef who's trying to make it big time in the city. Phoebe is a mystic, funny girl with not a very pleasant past, finally getting to live a decent life in the heart of new york with a legitimate job. Chandler is a witty and funny person, with a successful job in the city, one he's not very pleased with but one which pays well. Joey on the other hand is struggling actor who is doing what he loves but something with small paychecks. Ross is the most romantic and sensitive out of the guys, but the also the most unsuccessful with his love life, as he just got divorced since his wife turned out to be a lesbian. Though a successful paleontologist, but one who is not entirely happy with his life. The way the writers have carried on these characters into new but still the same type of people is just beautiful. Each season is unique in it's own way, but each season has one thing in Common, that is in each you feel a part of the gang and each season will have you laughing till you drop. Way to Go. TRUE FRIENDS of mine. This show was the thorn in the side for many lovers of wit, art and taste for an entire decade. This show just kept going, season after season, and none of us could figure out who the fools were that kept it on the air by watching it. Some of us suspected a terrorist plot to dumb down America; surely the ratings were rigged.<br/><br/>The show focused on up-scale yuppies whose glorified materialism provided most the plot fodder. The jokes were dumb and usually predictable. The acting was untrained and unfocused. There was no emotional connection between viewer and those on screen; when Rachel was pregnant there was a glimmer of hope she would die during child-birth. No such luck, of course.<br/><br/>Most episodes exploited human sexuality, but that is nothing new in 1990s television. Cheap sex captures attention and saves the writers from having to do any creative work.<br/><br/>The fact that unscrupulous network executives, producers, etc. broadcast this show with full knowledge and intent of it being seen by children is unforgivable. The show's main themes were not friendship (for a better understanding of Friendship Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is recommended) but rather hedonism, sexuality, materialism, and foolishness. Those who knowingly beamed this show to children made their pockets of dough, but on judgment day they just best not talk about their souls.<br/><br/>If you are looking for intelligent comedy, look elsewhere. As of this writing, IMDb recommends fans of this show also watch The Bob Newhart Show. This is ironic since both Newhart's main shows are brilliant. Friends, on the other hand, is trash. Fifty or a hundred years from now it will be watched as a mark of how decadent the 90s and early 21st century were. I'm obsessed with this show, it's like the best show ever, I was so upset to see it end. There wont be any other show with a romance that will have you screaming at the TV; "Get together for God's sake!!" and fans of the show, well at least of Ross and Rachel were doing that for TEN years. It had so many memorable moments, like that kiss in Central Perk, Monica and Chandler in London, Phoebe giving birth to her brother's babies, and memorable episodes like TOW No-One's ready, TOW the Football, TOW the Embryos and TOW Everybody Finds Out. I don't know how people don't like it, and don't find it funny, you people just are just strange!! I love "Friends". Sinse 1996 it has been my favourite show. I have almost all of the episodes on CDs. I have probably watched them like a milion times. I can probably even tell you every line there is. I read somewhere that the last episode was on fourth place on the number of people who have been watching it. I thing "Friends" deserves it. This show is perfect for young people like me. I have laughed so hard at some scenes. I specially like Courteney and Jennifer. I think they are great. Too bad that Joey never got married in the show. But the good thing is that everyone else did. I was very surprised when I found out that Monica and Chandler had slept together. And for my last words: "Good work on the last episode". The long running "Friends" was a carefree comedy that well deserved the recognition it received. The writers always created a plot that would draw the viewer out of the stressful real world into the carefree NY of "Friends." There was always some witty line or humorous event in the show that could get a laugh, which is, after all, the point of a sitcom. The real magic of this show, however, came not from the writers, but from the characters and the incredible chemistry they shared. It seems unlikely that a spoiled, rich, pretty girl, an uptight, clean-freak, formally fat chef, a dorky paleontologist recently divorced from his lesbian wife, a sarcastic son of a cross-dressing father who is bored with his job, an Italian playboy from a large family who loves eating sandwiches, and a singer-songwriter masseuse who lived in a box after her mother killed herself could be thrown into the same world and come out friends, but this eclectic mixture makes for variety and creates situations that could not happen on any other show. Occasionally "Friends" becomes formulaic, as with the mandatory dating between friends, but the characters are endearing, and throughout the course of the show, the viewer comes to love them. The character quirks of "Friends" are so endearing, that they have shaped American society. Where would we be without Joey's favorite pickup line "How you doing?" The show is humorous because the characters are flawed, thus they are real. Their flaws may be exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but the viewer can still relate to the characters, because (aside from the fact that they magically earn a living by going to their job about once a month) they are real. The show deserved it's success because of the unique, yet real, characters it created, which are now inseparable from our culture. This was one of the best things on TV and I'm very sorry to see it end. The characters on this show were excellent and they have become a big part of my life, and of the lives of millions of other people all over. Friends has made it's mark on the world and i know for a fact that there are loads of people from all over who are going to miss watching this well made, funny show on TV. This is the kind of TV show one can watch over and over again. The plot line's rock, the script is strong and the lines are hilarious, the performer's are way talented and the characters they play are realistic. What more are you looking for? "Friends" may not be the best sitcom of all time, but it is still my favorite. The cast's chemistry is unmatched, and the talent of each one of them is great, with Jennifer Aniston looking like the friend most likely to be a superstar of a Julia Roberts level. The show was the definitive view of "friends as family". All of these characters had family members, but they found their ultimate support system in each other. I also believe the finale did the show justice, and I give it credit for wrapping up all the stories,and giving audiences an emotional payoff,without being overblown. "Friends" is and always will be my very favorite sitcom of all time. I've read a lot of comments made about all ten seasons of the show, the season finale, and the cast. The truth is, I think ALL of you are a bunch of whiners. The people that hate the show, although they don't like it, and don't watch it, they think it's such a big deal. Honestly people, if you don't like the show, quit paying such close attention to the positive reviews and follow up. YOU shouldn't even care. If you're offended for Seinfeld or MASH or whatever other comedy you've watched, I'm VERY sorry but why would anyone want to hear all your cry baby comments on how the show or the cast members got too much attention? Your negative opinion is just ANNOYING. And those of you that are obsessed with the show and think that your life revolves around it, well, I feel sorry for you. Truthfully, I've watched the show various times, and I've found it VERY funny, but I don't care if the whole world thinks it sucks or the whole world thinks it's LIFE ITSELF. Honestly...I watch it, I think it's funny, and I don't care what reviews it gets or how much the cast members make or whatever. I care that these people can make me laugh every now and then..and to me, that's what counts. I love Seinfeld, but I couldn't care less if it got less or more attention than Friends...even though I like Seinfeld better. Seriously, stop crying about it! For those of you that are heartbroken because it's the end, stop crying and watch the re-runs! For those of you that think the show sucks, go start a forum on your own hate-friends website. Just remember folks...it's TV! It's not like it's happening outside your front door. I think this is the greatest comedy of all time, filled with laughter and emotion from start to finish. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross are all funny character's but the funniest has to be Phoebe. This is the best comedy ever made on television, and it is sad that it is now over. I will be watching the reruns on television whenever i have the time to watch them. I hope Matt Leblanc's Spin-Off Joey will make a great success, and i think it will be. I always loved Chandler's sarcastic comments he made and i loved all Phoebe's songs and my favorite song is Smelly Cat. Goodbye friends, you will never be forgotten. I can't wait to watch Joey, and i hope we will get to see all the charater's from friends. I loved the last ever episode titled "The Last One" it was very good and i think they done a great job. This is great show! The chemistry between the cast makes this show to be that excellent. script is good, most of their jokes are funny and the acting is right. They ended the series in a good way and right on time, they cant sit in a coffee house whole their life and talk, they grow up and move on. the finale episode was touching, sad and funny at once. if you didn't have a opportunity to watch this show in this decade, its not too late.<br/><br/>10\10 What can you say about a show that took Six Loser and I might add **Unfunny** actors and put them in a critically overhyped drama, none of these actors before or after have made any contribution to TV history, they are not worthy of the large paychecks they received or anything resembling our respect<br/><br/>There are funny sitcoms out there in the present and past of TV history, Doctor Doctor, Cheers, MASH, and none of them made the money that these losers did, for all of you loyal viewers of Friends I say that you are probably the ones on chat groups that can't spell, and that have limited mental capabilities, keep drinking alcohol until your brain rots!! I gotta tell ya,I have tried to watch this crap over the years because my sister,nieces and mother are wild about it.To me it's torture to watch.The whole mess is mediocre at best.The three male "actors" together couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag.They run the emotional gamit from A to B.Pathetic acting.Amateurish.Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow are actually actresses.That other,whatshername is she supposed to be an actress? From all the posts I gather that very young girls are the market for this drool.I prefer to watch the ads than this "comedy". Pathetic, unrealistic attempt at comedy.  This showcases nothing but a group of vapid young people who, due to a lack of creativity on the writers' part, have become more than "just friends".  I'm sure the writers of these episodes, at one point figured "Hey, since we have no more plot ideas, let's have ____ sleep with ______".  Literally every character on this show has slept with at least two other members of their little circle of friends. Nobody in their right mind could ever relate to these spoiled brats.  The friends'  financial security seems quite suspicious considering most of these friends are working jobs that fetch minimum wage, so how can they afford those plush NY apartments and gorgeous clothes?  Plus, I hate how whiny these guys are.  They seem very well-to-do despite their minimum wage jobs, but are still hopelessly miserable because of their relationship failures (hint: try breeding outside your little circle of friends, and maybe then you'd actually have a long-lasting relationship, you whiny dolts!).  Here's a rundown of the personalities on "Friends that, from what the show tells viewers, are apparently the basic types of people in NY... Chandler: token "sardonic witty guy".  Monica: token "Neat Freak".  Joey: token "Lovable male moron".  Ross: token "Lovable geek.  Phoebe: token "Spaced-out female moron".  Rachel: token "Bland and boring, somewhat neutral character used as basis of comparison for how 'normal' the rest of the neurotic characters should be, but aren't".  Trendy, superficial trash that only the MTV crowd could love... with phoniness and stereotypes abound thrown in the mix for good measure.  How much trendy and hackneyed could this crap get, you ask?  Well, these friends hang out in a coffee bar just like all the other friends have done in countless sitcoms before and after. I'm glad this show is almost gone. Friends may be very popular but it gets on my nerves, not because of it's content (the idea of 3 men and 3 women living together is not new, that idea has been around for a long time). I mean nothing exciting ever happens, and when something exciting does happen it always happens near the end of a season. But the one thing about this show, that always makes me tick...is the live audience. Whenever a celebrity appears or a marriage proposition happens the live audience just goes crazy and screams like crazy!. Sometimes I wish that this show had no need for canned laughter. It would be better that way. I cannot believe that this show has lasted this long.  I'll bet that if the cast have had at least one or two African-Americans or Asian-Americans or Hispanics, it would not have gotten the over-hyped attention it received when it first started.  The radio stations would not be playing the theme song a million times over.  The actors would not have gotten an outrageous amount of money like this cast has now.  People would only go so far as to say "this show is OK" rather than "I want these to be my "Friends"!"  And yet this show is set in NEW YORK...no diversity whatsoever! Why this show is so popular is totally beyond me. This show was the show of the young 90s generation.
(not mine, I was an adolescent during most of its run)
However, as I watch now as an adult of contemporary age of most of the protagonists, I find myself saying, "Wow, these are some pretty self-absorbed and childish liberals." But then again it's New York with no consequences, "do what you feel." The more I think about, the more I don't like this show. The Rachel/ Ross will they/ will they not get together? ( Oh Btw he's married multiple times and she's just too non- committal to anything except her hair). The only semi- adult relationship is between Chandler and Monica in later seasons. Joey didn't get enough air time, but then "Joey" spin-off was pretty bad, not enough for a full show. Who can forget "Smelly cat"? Overall, a show that could have been wrapped up in 2-3 seasons that NBC milked for years as part of its Thursday "Must See TV" block. It was coincident with Seinfeld for a few years, but was then elevated to the 9pm anchor slot after Seinfeld's Finale. It never quite filled the gap. Its Just to boring to watch mate do boring boring boring boring boring Mutch worse than the big bang Friends is an extremely poor show. Never understand stood how anybody could sit through such catty mellow drama. Its like if Seinfeld had nothing going for it, in fact its a show about nothing and is still better then this garbage.Every episode is people overreacting about nothing and making dimwitted decisions. Friends don't let Friends watch Friends. The theme song for this is catchy and musically top notch, which alone makes this worth more than 2/10.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a dull series apparently about three perfect men and three perfect women, which the writers are quite inept at making look imperfect.<br/><br/>They're also incredibly dull, and impossible to relate to.<br/><br/>It is one of those series that is impossible for a non drug abuser to stay awake through for more than 45 seconds. So, it could be a good Insomnia cure, but more than likely will just irritate you if you try to watch it.<br/><br/>The situations and relationships are impossible to relate to. This TV serie shows wealthy persons in Manhattan talking every time about superficial topics. They seem totally focus on sex, 'friends' and their little ego. We always see different sensual partners that their group needs to approve. The characters seem fake, superficial and selfish Seriously, i never could find this show funny. I lost count of how many times i tried. But i couldn't. Even when the show tells when you have to laugh, and that's the big problem at least for me. It's a show that laughs at what they think are "good jokes". Maybe a product of it's time, maybe. But it's a problem i find with the sitcom format in general. It's so stupid that i can't give up to it. The only spoiler i can think of is that this show is totally stupid. I think it was "good" at the time, but it hasn't aged well and just gets worse the more I watch it. It's not funny, the acting is over dramatic, there's  and really none of the characters are likable. There are tons of way better shows. Ranking Friends four stars at some point years ago, and I think I was being generous.When the show was on the air I called it three stupid girls, two stupid guys and a rat face. I sort of get the appeal. The viewers of it during the day are today's parents of snowflakes. The dialogue on the show is interchangeable. Stupid people like that. You don't have to concentrate or get confused about the characters. Watch the first couple seasons of Sunny in Philadelphia, if you really want to see how 20-something left wing idiots behave. There is nothing better in TV series than Friends. The dialogue writing,acting,plot screenplay,jokes,even the back ground music is just so perfect. There is no one I guess who hasn't seen the series once more after watching it all. The last episode just brings tears in your eyes,no matter how many times you watch it you sob inside. The show is like a part of my life.I can't just stop thinking about it everyday. Its a phenomenal piece of work. The character ,"oh my GOD" are just unique and they cannot be more perfect. Each and everyone is different and very important part of the show. The love for this show will never end. Many show will come and go but 'FRIENDS' will always stay in my heart! Everybody loves Friends. Anybody who doesn't like friends is part of a group of the worst people in the world which is also made up of Justin Bieber and One direction fans. Friends is hilarious unlike me. Friends is also romantic unlike me. It baffles me how I like it so much as I've got nothing in common with it. But I do. I can watch every episode over and over again without getting bored. There is nothing that compares to it. The writers are genius's but the performance of the actors makes the script and therefore the show funnier. There's no doubt that the fact that the events that occur in the show could realistically happen to you and me- ordinary people- has at least helped to make the show as successful as it is. But it's now over ten years since the show ended and people still watch it and love it and laugh at it. Friends is also known for having massive stars, for example Bruce Willis, Jeff Goldblumm and Brad Pitt in there show and it's brilliant to see them out of their comfort zone and just doing something completely different. For example it's quite funny to see Bruce Willis go from shooting down terrorists in Nakatomi tower to singing Love machine in front of a mirror. However I'm going to end my review now, having realised that everybody who has the luxury of internet will have probably watched at least one episode of Friends. But if not, WATCH IT! I think they should bring Friends back as a reunion show and do a spin off with the original cast having a family and kids.... Now thats reality. The show was awesome and funny. How many shows are out there like this. We sometimes forget who are friends are and hoe to treat each other. I have enjoyed watching this show every night on TBS. I want to buy the full set. But better than that would be watching the new show. With Courtney Cox not being Married I think this will give her a boost for her. As far as everyone else what are they doing? Put this show back out there. The ratings will sky rocket Im sure. More people like that show than we know. I really do like this sitcom. I never understood the need of people to compare it to Seinfeld and make a battle of which show is better. I like them both, but those are two different types of sitcoms to me. Just because they are both about Friends living in New York it doesn't mean that they have that much in common <br/><br/>Friends has created some pretty good characters. Chandler is one of the favorites because of his sarcasm. Phoebe is a very unique character. Ross is incredibly funny. They all have something special about them <br/><br/>The acting also was good. David Schwimmer is my absolute favorite in it. His performance as Ross often made even episodes with story lines I didn't care much about rise to a higher level. They all had their moment where they did a great job, some more often than others<br/><br/>And there were quiet a few great story lines. Some of them that went on for several episodes and some small ones that we only saw for one episode. There was a lot of diversity in those themes and some original ideas <br/><br/>The show did go down a bit after a few seasons. Mainly after Monica and Chandler got together. What happened after was that Monica's character was completely ruined. She used to be likable in the first 4 seasons but after this there was nothing positive left about her. Chandler went down a bit as well because of their relationship. And Phoebe had her bad moments towards the end even though for the most part she remained a great character <br/><br/>There were a few story lines that I could live without, like for example the whole Joey and Rachel story.<br/><br/>And yet, I can probably find 10 or maybe even less episodes that I completely disliked in the whole ten seasons. The show continued to make me laugh until the very end And I don't care if the show isn't all that realistic. If I want reality, I watch news. This show is sitcom that I watch to laugh, not to figure out how Joey makes Chandler pay for his stuff or how Phoebe can afford to live in Manhattan. I also don't mind that it is lighter humor, not something incredibly intellectual. I like this as well<br/><br/>And besides comedy, we also get some great relationships on this show. My favorite one would be Joey and Chandler. Their friendship is my favorite. They have so many great moments! The time when Joey moved out, or Chandler going to the box and staying quiet when Katie talked to him because he cared for Joey. These are just two examples out of many.<br/><br/>Ross and Rachel's relationship was very well done as well. All their ups and downs have kept viewers intrigued for many years. And they have performed it very well and always had a great chemistry.<br/><br/>No matter how often I watch it, I always get a feeling of sadness when I see the last episode and I have tears in my eyes when Rachel gets off the plane. They really did a great job with keeping me enjoying the show for so many years <br/><br/>And now that I have said it all, I just will tell my opinion on the most debated topic of Friends: They WERE on a break! I did get into friends bit late, i think was near end of Season 4 and the first episode I saw I fell in love with the show.<br/><br/>I Loved the show, it didn't take me to long catch up on show, now i love watching the repeats of Friends everyday even twice day. when nothing on TV will watch friends DVD, as I have all of series on DVD.<br/><br/>Friends have some great story lines such Ross and Rachell on and off, Getting married Vegas, having baby again and in even in final, Sometimes when Ross is by him self, dose silly such as getting teeth really white so you can see them in dark, Messing up it tanning place, getting stuck in pants.<br/><br/>All season are great but season 5 the out shine the rest as it was peak five in the show, Mon and Chan secrets running around, one by one everyone else find out, it so hilarious.<br/><br/>Then best thing about show like is it can be funny and they can have some sad episode. When Mon and Chan find out that they can't have baby, which is really sad as Mon as always wanted a baby from day 1.<br/><br/>Acting is show as well as the script was outstanding. 10/10 i will always love this show I always thought TV Soaps or Shows are jus mere crappy and filled with all unnecessary drama only to blow your mind off(i mean giv u migranes).<br/><br/>FRIENDS is one show wit awesome written characters(Writers/Producers take a bow) and absolute comic in every situation, let it be Embarrassing situations, Funny situations, Emotional sequences...i mean you just work hard all day get bugged of all nonsense stuff going on around us n come back home to switch on the TV u just need something exactly like FRIENDS just to take you to some new world where its just Fun, Laughter and Fun again with everything they do.<br/><br/>Its a CULT show that can never be remade into anything(Movie, Book or Cartoon). I just admire one character little above all "Chandler Bing"!!! First came Seinfeld, then Frasier, and finally Friends: the three sitcom milestones of the '90s. And yet only Friends is constantly mentioned when that decade comes up in conversations all over the world. What is that extra something that made it a worldwide hit, whereas the other two went pretty much unnoticed outside the States? Well, Frasier is a bit of a hard sell in non-English-speaking countries (some of the jokes get lost in translation, especially if dubbed), and Seinfeld just had the bad luck of receiving poor time slots because, like many Americans prior to 1992 (the year the fourth season went on the air), people didn't realize it was the best comedy on television. Friends, on the other hand, was a straightforward tale of six people who knew they could always rely on each other. That winning formula is what made it the most popular American sitcom of the '90s, not to mention one of the best.<br/><br/>Set in the quintessential sitcom city, Manhattan, the show starts in a fundamental location: the coffee shop where the six friends meet, much like the Happy Days gang used to hang out at Arnold's. It's where many of the series' key scenes happen, including the magic moment when the group is fully formed (one of them didn't actually join the "team" until a couple of minutes into the first episode). All of them are twenty-somethings, and each one has his or her own set of problems: Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) must try to live by herself and not rely on her parents' credit cards anymore; Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is always struggling to obtain her folks' approval (plus, she's obsessed with everything being like she left it in the house); Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) refuses to accept the fact that she isn't very talented as a singer and has a penchant for weird behavior in general; Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is very popular with the ladies, but less so when it comes to auditioning for film roles (he isn't very bright, either); Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is forever haunted by a messed-up childhood; and Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer), aside from being deeply in love with Rachel, has a tendency to whine and fall for the wrong women (he married a lesbian).<br/><br/>Over the course of ten years, those six characters evolve, fall in love, get married, have children and other things, though not necessarily in that order. It isn't what happens that's important, though: it's who it happens to that makes the difference. The main reason Friends lasted over 200 episodes is that it centered around those six people, and had those six actors playing them. Is it possible to imagine anyone else as the adorably dim Joey, the nerdy Ross or the feisty Phoebe? Sure, giving LeBlanc his own spin-off show was a mistake (Joey's no Frasier, for crying out loud), but for ten years he and his five co-stars kept viewers hooked to the small screen, simply because they had become a family television couldn't afford to be without. Whereas Seinfeld had the creative boldness and Frasier the wonderfully sophisticated wit, Friends lived on because it was so damn funny, and it was all due to the cast.<br/><br/>Of course, a Simpsons-worthy list of guest stars didn't damage the show's popularity, either. From Bruce Willis to Charlton Heston, via Sean Penn, Brad Pitt (sharing the screen with then-wife Aniston in an unexpected, very funny way) and George Clooney (spoofing his ER role alongside co-star Noah Wyle), each visiting A-lister brought something special. But at its core, the show's real value lies in the title: even now, who doesn't miss LeBlanc's "How you doin'?", Kudrow's vitality or Perry's mistimed puns? They were - and still are - the kind of friends everyone would want to have: honest, reliable and funny. Three characteristics that make sure Friends will always be remembered as an essential American sitcom. I do admit, when i first heard of Friends, i thought... wow another crappy cheap sitcom. When I finally saw an episode (nothing else was on TV) i flipped. The comedy in this show is excellent and the story is also good. If you haven't seen an episode and you think ye right, like a review will change my mind... just watch at least a few episodes you will laugh so hard $50. There are really sad emotional moments in friends, and in the same episodes they still have really funny moments. Give this show a chance if you think it is a crappy sitcom, cause it's not. Hope there is a friends movie!!! :D Friends has many funny characters: <br/><br/>Rachel - The girl trying to live without her father and his big money, has a crush on Ross<br/><br/>Monica - The clean obsessive girl who cooks a lot, sister of Ross<br/><br/>Phoebe - The funniest character, just some random massager who is friends with the whole group<br/><br/>Chandler - lives across the hall from Monica and Rachel with Joey, he is funny and messy <br/><br/>Ross - The Palientologist who studies dinosaurs and is the funny nerd of the group <br/><br/>Joey - The struggling actor who lives with Chandler, he likes to steal food from Monica and is kind of stupid. Granted its over and many have forgotten but in the hearts of millions of fans the show still lives on.I can't believe when i am feeling down if i remember any event of friends,it cracks me up.As entertaining as it was,furthermore it has left a deep psychological effect on me.I still sometimes wonder what would have happened had the show went on.The pairing of the six people was beautiful and in due course they really became best friends.The parting was just too painful and we all wished that the show never ended It instilled in everyone of us a desire to be friends like them.It was not just about the comedy it was also about the emotional bonding.It was a beautiful mix of eccentric characters who passed their lives leaning on the trusty shoulders of their friends Seriously, this is the greatest thing on TV ever! All my childhood I thought that my favourite TV program was the Simpson's, but as I got older I started to watch Friends more, and I enjoyed it! Every single episode made me laugh! I could probably watch the same episode 10 times before it got boring! My favourite male character was probably Ross as he was the one who really got me into friends. But I actually think that the best male actor was Mathew Perry, he should be in more comedy films! He also got the very last laugh in the last episode when he said the single word "Where?" My favourite female character is probably Rachel as she's quite funny. But I think that the best actress is probably Courtney Cox. Every time I watch the last episode of friends it makes me cry inside, because I know that everyone in the cast and crew were crying. Well what can be said about friends that hasn't been said countless times before? Friends has been analysed and dissected so often that it's a wonder that the six actors aren't covered in bruises! There is really nothing left new to say, so all that I can do is say it again in my own, inimitable way.<br/><br/>Quite simply, friends is probably the funniest programme you will ever see. The jokes are exquisitely timed and thought out, and they do not rely on one kind of humour - there is witty one-liners and visual comedy, comedy gleamed from mere facial expressions and simply hilarious situations - well it is a situation comedy! The writers have managed to take the simplest situation - six twenty-something friends and their loves, careers, and family problems - and make something that is pure gold to watch.<br/><br/>Each twenty minute episode is jam-packed with quality gags, and not a single episode goes by without a number of laughs to be had. The writing is top quality, the acting is flawless, and the outstanding cast is constantly backed up by a superb supporting cast and a roll-call of Hollywood (and British!) talent dropping by from time to time as guest stars. But where Friends' real success lies is in making the viewers genuinely care about its' six characters - we feel for them, we laugh with them, cry with them, and we grow up with them over the course of their ten years. We see the characters change, grow, evolve over the ten series, and while they change, they also remain at the core those same twenty-something guys we became friends with.<br/><br/>Some say that the later series didn't have the same punch, or the same high quality of writing and performances as the earlier seasons, and to a certain extent this is true. The gags don't feel quite as tight or sharp in the later series as in those early lightning quick early season episodes, and the characters in some respects don't so much as grow as become almost caricatures of their former selves. The early personalities are still there, but grown out of all proportion. Joey gets unbelievably dumber, Chandler more and more sarcastic, Monica frighteningly OCD....you get the idea. They have become grotesque cartoon versions of their earlier selves. But yet, somehow, the magic remains. We still love them. And while the gags may not constantly stream at a dizzying height of quality towards the end, thee is still plenty there to make us laugh.<br/><br/>And that is where Friends succeeds above many many inferior shows. It just tries to make us laugh. Occasionally we will cry, be shocked etc as well, but never forget that Friends is a sitcom at heart. Maybe it should have been finished a couple of series earlier, or maybe we couldn't bear to let it go. One thing is for sure, the departure of this terrific sitcom left one hell of a void in our programming. There will never be the like of friends again - though beware cheap imitations! You can't compare any other show with Friends, this is the greatest sitcom of all time. If you haven't seen it, go buy the dvds.<br/><br/>I wish they'd made more episodes while this was on the air, now the actors might be getting too old to make another season, or they might just not want to, which is too bad. Even if you have, like me, seen all the episodes many times they are still hilarious. The only problem with this show is the number of episodes, 238 just isn't enough!<br/><br/>This is the only sitcom on IMDb worth 10/10, if in the future something even comes close to the greatness of Friends it should be awarded in my opinion.<br/><br/>Maybe there's still hope for a reunion episode or something... "Friends" revolves around the lives of six distinctive, yet unique individuals. Although their lives seem to be typically American, if anyone, anywhere, had the chance to live half as happily as any one of the characters of the show, he could without a doubt consider himself the luckiest person on earth. "'Friends' gives us hope, hope of a better life". Although the plot caries the characters throughout numerous troubles and quarrels, the love that the six share allows them to overcome any obstacle and even turn the darkest moments into humor. "Laughter is the best medicine" Â– quite true. The only shame is that the person to make up that saying never had a chance to see an episode of 'Friends'. Truly incredible, there is not a single episode out of the 240, which would cause you to fall off your couch, or choke on spaghetti out of laughter. Any person to watch only a few consecutive episodes would inevitably fall in love with all six characters, who play the roles of what have become to be their own personalities. The only and greatest negative remark regarding 'Friends', is that they should have kept the show going. The writers, Marta Kaufman and David Crane, proved they can keep the excitement of the show going for ten years, which means they could have continued it indefinitely, and they should have. The greatest show to ever exist can be hardly considered a compliment. Well, what can i say? There are no words to describe the utter excellence, effort and comedy in this show. The writers are right up there as some of the best writers in history. The way the characters have grown over the years is great, and yet again due to the ace writing. The three girls on the show are babes, and all three are comic geniuses. Jennifer Aniston plays spoilt daddy's girl Rachel Green really well. Also, the neurotics of Monica, played by Courteney Cox is fabulous. Her comic timing is astounding. Lisa Kudrow is brilliant in the way her character Phoebe Buffay can talk about such terrible things that have happened in her life like they are normal, everyday things. Ahh, the guys. Matt LeBlanc is a great actor, and might i add as a 13 year old girl, gorgeous. Nobody delivers a line like Matthew Perry. He is as sharp as a whip. David Schwimmer? What can i say? The way it takes him 10 minutes to say a word is utter comedy. This show is without a doubt one of the funniest, comforting shows ever. It's basically 22 minutes of fun. Friends is a series that will never die!! Over ten series we watch the six friends grow and get closer, within that we see several marriages, arguments and make-ups. During the seasons I believe that the episodes went deeper into each friends life and showed us a lot more character, along with that the writers managed to show us a whole new side of comedy. I believe that FRIENDS will pave the way for new and upcoming comedies. I come from the United Kingdom and I am accustomed to and love the British sense of humour, but I believe the writers bought the best out of every episode and made the series an international treasure. I believe that the series was rounded off nicely, but when I heard of I possible come back for our friends, I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to here more. Even though I was excited I was worried that they might destroy a perfect ending, let's hope the trio of writers can come up with another great episode (or two). I was 5 or 6 when Friends first aired in England,since it watched started I watched every season and I'm collecting them on DVD. Friends, I do believe is and may well be the best sitcom ever. Friends is realistic but the timing of the serious parts it's perfect. Friends deals with what 20 odd year old deal with, careers, relationships and possibly children by the last season you can see how the characters have grown up and have the career they wanted and the marriages and the children. In the first episode Rachel walked out of her wedding and found Monica she stayed there for the night (and 6 more years!), We find out that Ross was married to a lesbian so that ended there marriage (and she later found out she was pregnant with his child.)Oh and Monica hooks up with Paul the Wine guy. I have to say my favourite Friends episode was TOWT Football. I spent years absolutely hating Friends for even pretending that it was a comedy, but I think I've had a slight reappraisal recently.<br/><br/>I still think it would be hard-pressed to be less funny. As far as I could see, there are only limited number of 'laughs' on Friends: <br/><br/>1) Phoebe calls someone something funny, eg. someone walks in with a pair of rabbit ears on and Phoebe says, "Hey, rabbit boy." <br/><br/>2) Speaking in a funny voice.<br/><br/>3) Age-old immediately rebuked ironic statement, eg. someone says they aren't afraid of mice, a mouse appears and they jump on the table and start screaming. This happens once in Blackadder and was kind of a let-down for me because it reminded me of Friends, even though associating the two would be like trying to draw comparisons between Sirloin Steak and a hamburger.<br/><br/>If I missed something then I probably didn't see the episode in which it happened.<br/><br/>BUT strangely, and worryingly, all that doesn't make it the least funny programme you can watch. That prize has to be shared by the multitude of follow-up 'sitcoms' like Will and Grace etc etc, which can even make Friends seem humorous.<br/><br/>In defence of the show, I do realise that there are many people, I even know some of them, who would rather miss out on oxygen than Friends. And by listening when they talk about Friends I get the impression that what is most important to a devotee is the story-line. Cliff-hangers at the end of series don't happen in most sitcoms after all. I get the feeling that they would watch Friends even if it was announced that the next series would be pure drama and would make no attempt to be funny. I think it has been around long enough that, in the viewer's eyes, the comedy aspect has lost its significance in comparison to simply being able to keep track of the characters' lives.<br/><br/>I haven't maybe watched enough Friends to comment on its value as a drama, but I do know that I can count the number of times it has made me laugh on one finger. So, I offer no opinion of where Friends stands amongst the ranks of drama series, but for people to call it a 'comedy', let alone 'the funniest programme ever', is frankly an insult to the many programmes out there that are actually funny. Friends is hands down the best sitcom of all time, the main reasons are the chemistry on screen and that they are best friends off screen, which is rare because in most sitcoms, the actors hate each other because one gets overshadowed and has less publicity! even tho friends is like that because of Jennifer Aniston overshadowing Courtney and Lisa, they still stick by each other! lets explore the main characters:<br/><br/>Rachel Green: played by Jennifer Aniston, when we first saw her back in 1994 she was spoilt and was daddy's little girl, but as time went she became independent and into her own after the "We were on a break" and when she married Ross and Vegas, we saw that she was over Ross and stood up and said "we can't stay Married", she is telling him that its over, this is the main highlight, Rachel standing up for herself. season.since she had her baby thats when we see the true Rachel Green for the first time. Plus shes HOOOTTT!!!!! rating 8/10<br/><br/>Monica Gellar: played by Courtney Cox- Monica is the bitchiest out of all three girls because she gets very competitive and never lets anyone win, especially chandler since they got married, she isn't my favourite character but she does have her moments i.e as fat Monica. rating 7/10<br/><br/>Phoebe Buffay- Played by Lisa Kudrow, Phoebe is the funniest female character hands down, her songs, her wit and her blondness makes her such a brilliant creation to watch, i couldn't imagine anyone playing her, also her twin sister is funny because you can see that they don't get along and after the "Buffay the Vampire layer" porn movie incident where Ursula used Phoebes name, you can see why Phoebe hates her.also Lisa portrays Phoebes troubled life with a smile and i think that is what makes Lisa such a great actress. rating 10/10.<br/><br/>Joey Tribbiani: played by Matt Leblanc. Joey is a great character but he is not my favourite because after a while, Joey became a tiresome character and all the other Friends all got married had kids etc but he didn't seem to fit in anymore, i mostly admired the Joey and Chandler relationship, which got built up over the years which is great, they have more chemistry on screen than Chandler has with Monica, because i think that they were closer than he was with Monica. i don't think that his Sitcom will ever be as successful because they main characters bore me, and there is no chemistry on screen.8/10<br/><br/>Chandler Bing: played by Matthew Perry, Chandler the best he really is, my favourite Character because he is always making fun of how slow and dumb Joey is, i grew bored of him when he married Monica because he lost his Witt, Monica kept on being serious all the time and thats when Chandler became serious and thats why i grew bored! but he is still the best! he still does have is moments but Monica took that away and made him more mature which was a big mistake for Chandler Fans.rating 10/10<br/><br/>Ross Gellar: played by David Schimmer. Ross, when Friends started he wasn't the best Character because he was quite boring, but as seasons went on Davids acting and comic timing improved and thats when he became really funny! i liked it when he screamed "WE WERE ON A BREAK" after this he became funny, and as his relationship with Rachel ended, thats when he challenged Matthew Perry as the funniest Friend. I'm glad that He and Rachel got back together and i would have liked this as a sitcom than 'JOEY'. 10/10<br/><br/>Friends will always be the best and even tho some episodes are bad and some are excellent, you cant take the chemistry and great acting away from this great sitcom, the best seasons are 3,4,5,6,7 and 10! also I'm looking forward to the movie that has just been announced! Friends R.I.P 1994-2004 Friends is genius. When i talk to my friends and family about the show, it appeals to everyone no matter what age. The cast give that special performance that makes it seem so real that it feels you're just looking into your neighbour's home. There's not one episode where i think "that was dull" and i have never walked out the room when friends is on TV. My favourite character by far is Pheobe. As well as being extremely eccentric, she is a role model to anyone who wants to build up their confidence. None of the men in the show are model material, which makes a change from all the programmes that have stunning male stars which everyone fancies; it makes it seem so fake. The only thing wrong with friends is that it is finished and no more episodes will be filmed. To summarise everything i have said, without a doubt, friends is the greatest thing since television began. Some people seem to misunderstand what this funny sitcom is all about.<br/><br/>Basically, there are 6 friends living in Manhattan, these hilarious episodes are just about life, relationships and money.<br/><br/>It is a great TV programme and you haven't lived till you see a few of the episodes.<br/><br/>All i want to say is.......................<br/><br/>WATCH IT! Personally, it is one of my favourites and i never miss an episode on the telly!<br/><br/>I hope this short comment is useful to you and i really hope it makes you want to watch it for yourself. This show does have an interesting story and great production quality. BUT, is too overacted. The "funny" content of this show is so forced and exaggerated.<br/><br/>For a movie like Austing Powers (where they're mainly doing PARODY) it's OK to be exaggerated. It's a must. But for a show that's about real life, it just doesn't make sense. I mean, those gestures don't happen in real life. <br/><br/>Normal shows like "Seinfeld" or "Everybody Loves Raymond" have some exaggerated content but is a very small percentage mixed with real life stuff.<br/><br/>But Friends is about 90% exaggerated & overacted.<br/><br/>Characters like Phoebe & Joey make you think "what planet is that?!" Ross is the absolute worst character in all of history. He makes me want to die. What a loser, Rachel deserved better. Basic jokes/plot. Not a fan. I dont get the whole sitting around the coffee shop talking about absolutely nothing. Disgusted I can't understand why kids from this generation are pretending to be a great fan of this show just because it's a very famous show.
I rarely find it funny. Don't get me wrong, It had It's moments I think the chemistry between the Actors Is excellent I loved the sardonic one liners from Matthew Perry but the poor writing lets It down. Definately doesn't compare to Frasier which was superior In every way. Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is a runaway bride. She finds former friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) who lets her stay in her New York apartment. Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer) has a secret crush on Rachel. Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) are their neighbors. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is their eccentric friend.<br/><br/>You can call it too fake. You can call it too white. But you can't deny its popularity. The show is about six friends in NYC. It's not much more. It doesn't have anything out of the ordinary. None of the Friends had much of a resume before this show. They were all new and fresh faced. Most importantly, they had chemistry together. The incredible popularity and the over night success really isolated these 6 and cemented them as lifelong friends. And you can tell they were friends. It showed on the screen for all 10 seasons. It surprised me a show of this caliber could last ten seasons, most likely the reason was greed, they didn't want to end such a high-rating show, give it a dignified exit (although any chance of that was long gone). There have been tens of thousands of poor American sitcoms in the last decade, strangley, Friends has outlasted many of its superiors. The characters were so thick it was almost unthinkable, the situations not outlandish or funny at all. If you can hear what they are saying over the continuous barrage of canned laughter cranked up to 11, you will have even more trouble deciphering it. Perhaps the only reason it became popular because it in element is simply a soap, with a small attempt at humour. Certainly avoid if you like good comedy. First of all, I want to say I became a big fan of all these 6 characters after saw this show. And I downloaded all of these lead role actors movies and watch it. Each and every show is funny and hilarious. I became addict to this show and want to see a movie, at least a Thanksgiving. But there is no news about continuing the show. So I ended up to watch every episodes again and again. Then I find a each and every bit of details in these episodes. For this extra ordinary story telling, my thumbs are up!!!<br/><br/>But in Season 8 Episode 8,The One with the Stripper, Mona is kicking the God Ganesh Statue with her Boots while kissing Ross.It is such a slap in my believe...!!!. Why they have to include this scene. The respective people in this show, should avoided this scene. It was telecast in 2001, and we people didn't have these channels or even a knowledge about this show. If it is played by now, I am sure the people like me, will raise the questions and the show people paid the consequences. <br/><br/>Because of this one scene, I am not going to say this show is bad. But They should avoid this kinds of scene at least in future. I sware now it's a part of my life. When I started I thought that i ll get bored nd I'll leave it without seeing half now I think there should be more than 236 episodes It's a TV show funny although moving. I can't weary this serie. When i'm not feeling up i watch one episode to get better. I love characters and actors are very good because they manage to evolve their character throughout the serie. I like the credits because they are catchy. I watch this TV show ever since i was little and this the best serie ever The Shows cast seem to be good friends however I believe being Hollywood for so long it seems like that might have decreased, and that's a shame because I think people need to laugh more like I did and still do when I see these.
My favorite characters were Joey and Chandler but Phoebe and Rachel were great too. Ross was good when he went on his rage episodes and interactions with the group and poor Monica did her best but some scenes seemed too much. Although she was needed for the story.<br/><br/>Great show and wish they could reunite Constantly on repeat on netflix, I probably know all the words off by heart now and same goes to my Nan too, she loves the series as well. Never gets old and it's a great pick me up as well. I first watched the series back in 90's. Among my friends we had that 'FRIENDS slang' because we knew every single line in the show. And we were still kids then. Trough the years i have watched "Friends" several times, then it came 2016. Since that year i haven't stopped watching it over and over and over again... I'm 35 years now. I think i will never stop watching THEM anymore.... I first started watching this show on Netflix and I was so engrossed that I forgot to eat breakfast and lunch the first day Stress buster!!! Exams went wrong, got scoldings from parents, bored, tired, depressed etc etc the only solution is "F.R.I.E.N.D.S." This was one interesting show, essentially it defined comedy for the millenial
generation.<br/><br/>Three men, three women typical of young people as they like to see themselves
decide to room together in New York City, rents being what they are. The women
were Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston,and Courtney Cox. The guys are David
Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc.<br/><br/>With six characters from different backgrounds there was a chance to bring
in girlfriends, boyfriends, relations of all kinds in a whole range of plot situations for episodes. One of the reasons the show clicked.<br/><br/>The bigger reasons was however the chemistry between the six. You can never
tell, you just hope you make the right casting and the audience likes the ensemble. That's sheer luck at times.<br/><br/>I know my nieces of the younger generation really dug this show as they
entered their teen years. I kind of liked it myself I loved each and every season of this 90s sitcom. There is not one character in the show that cannot make you laugh, unlike The Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother (which has shallow jokes and a weak storyline).
Friends attained a cult status among the youth and watching the early seasons give us a clear idea of the way of life back then and given our age of Facebook and Twitter, it does seem impossible to believe how the 20 year-olds survived without social networking.
The characters in the show were cleverly written and the stereotypes were equally well handled. Everybody's favorite character on the show is definitely Chandler Bing, for his surreal sarcasm, his constant urge to crack jokes and his effeminacy. Phoebe Buffay's random dialogues do tickle the funny bone consistently but Rachel Greene is too annoying, playing a pampered brat trying to make her own in the big city. Ross and Monika Geller share good chemistry as brother-sister and the stories from their childhood are really good. Joey Tribbiani, the foodie-actor who is Chandler's best friend delivers his dialogues with immaculate timing and his encounters with Chandler are memorable. I just loved Friends, it was funny and lovable with a hint of seriousness about it. Joey was just cute and funny, Rachel was beautiful and daring. Ross was romantic. Friends is just one of those shows you can relate to, it caught most of everyday life little problems onbs regular bases and that helped it form a connection with its viewers. The characters are soooo loveable, the jokes are funnier even after a thousand times, the lines are iconic, it's just gold! Best best best best best best 😁
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
wow and wow and wow
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 I unsurprisingly admit that this is yet the greatest show ever and the greatest 6 cast member of all time and not to forget Gunther :). The 6-stars has it all. I still wish that there will be a movie as a sequel for the show !. Heartbroken 💔 Being knowledgeable of pop culture I've known about this show for years before I actually binged it on NETFLIX so I had already known about the major plot point of Ross & Rachel. I had recently finished watching the King of Queens series, that did not end well IMO (then when I re-watched many episodes I realized the show wasn't very funny, damn sure not funny enough to survive 200+ episodes). P.s. I noticed Carrie Heffernan, Doug's alcoholic boss, Kelli Palmer, and Mr. Prizan in later seasons (all characters from that show were all in earlier Friends episodes). However unlike that show I found my self laughing mighty hard at many episodes of Friends. I thought as far as representing many 20-30 year olds this show did a pretty good/funny job of depicting that time period in many peoples lives. It wasn't perfect (especially regarding relationships) because I thought in later parts of seasons 4 & 5, many things happened too quickly: Ross & Emily, Gary the cop and Phoebe (he asked her to move in with him after only 5 episodes?). Season 5, Rachel and the Tate Donovan (yeti) character, why was she soo obsessed with him, he truly had no attractive qualities. My other problem was why did Chandler and Monica keep their relationship a secret, your friends are supposed to be the 1st people you come to with relationship news. In season 6, ep. 2, Monica says she didn't want to rush into moving in together, however, they say they only do it because marriage is too extreme. Shouldn't you live with someone because you want to cohabit-ate with them? Which brings me to my least favorite characters: the Gellers. I wasn't a fan of either character, don't understand why anyone would want to be in a relationship with either of them. Monica's incredibly anal and selfish while Ross is a whiny baby of a man who is also incredibly selfish (I don't know what the hell Rachel saw in him, I get that relationship played well for audiences but is it the most believable? I don't think so). Every time something good happened to Rachel, Ross's 1st thought was WHAT ABOUT ME, HOW DO I FIT INTO THIS? Don't even get me started with the "we were on a break" scenario or when she gets her 1st fashion job and how he flipped out about her not being able to eat dinner with him one night. 
BUT the humorous parts outweigh my disdain for the Gellers and the whiplash pace of relationships. My fave characters are Phoebe and Joey they cracked me up SOOOO MUCH. Some of my series fave scenes were Phoebe singing the song about underwear in the episode where she dates 2 dudes, those 80s flashback scenes, the Smelly Cat video, and so many more. Ultimately 4 of my favorite scenes from the entire show involve guess who... The Gellers, When the 2 of them dance on New Years Rockin Eve, when Monica dances during the closing credits in season 6, ep. 15, when she dances in that 80s flashback at her first college party in season 10, and of course, Ross's bagpipes. I almost cried during all those scenes!! It is definitely a show I can and will re-watch multiple times. The. Best. Comedy. Show. Of. All. Time. And yes better than: Arrested Development, Seinfeld, The Office, Parks and Rec, Modern Family, Glee, Family Guy, Simpsons and more. It's better than all of them I've seen every episode probably 10 times and I still laugh. There isn't one bad episode. There are so many classic episodes and this show is just amazing. Matt LeBlanc, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow are exceptionally great. Courtney Cox, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry are also good. These characters are complex and 3-demensional. The writers deserve all the credit as these performances would be nothing without the witty dialogue and plot. <br/><br/>Vegas, Shepard's pie, Barbados, jellyfish, tossing a ball, the iconic new year's eve dance and so much more. If you're told that the show sucks, watch it. I promise you'll like it. Compared to a lot of current sitcoms I still prefer to watch this show. I watch the reruns over and over again. Got the DVDs if there's nothing good on TV. Our favorite character is Monica. She's just like my wife though I'm no Chandler. Our next favorite character is Phoebe. Though we like Jennifer Aniston as an actress but Rachel is our least favorite character. I've rated F.R.I.E.N.D.S 10 stars and it thoroughly deserves it. I have been a loyal F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan for years. The characters never fail to make you laugh and they always draw you into their stories and the shenanigans that happens through out the series. The relationship arcs between the characters are so well written! The journey these characters take is so interesting to watch and you never get bored. It has everything! Relationships, marriage, love, divorce, the series touches on sexuality,the reality of jobs and what it's like to navigate a long friendship with a group of people. You can also relate to these characters emotionally and what they are going through so much!! It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I recommend F.R.I.E.N.D.S to absolutely everyone. In the end, who doesn't want to see a young Jennifer Aniston in an amazing '90's sitcom with Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer?<br/><br/>It's(kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck) fantastic!!! This is one of my favorite TV-shows ever. Cast is great as well as script. It's about six people in their 20s living together in New York. You get to follow their job lives, family lives, love lives etc. It's comedy, called a sit-com so most scenes are taped where the protagonists are sitting in a couch or such. <br/><br/>It is an American masterpiece. I could describe this show forever and go on and write about how much I like it but why waste time reading MY review with my opinion when you can create your own opinion by watching the show yourself. Go on. Watch it. Go meet Monica, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Rachel, Phoebe. Go make some new friends. I can't explain to you how much I love this show. Friends is one of the best things to ever happen to television. The cast is outstanding and the characters are well thought out. There aren't many episodes I don't like. I can honestly tell you that I don't hate any episodes. There are only a small few, probably seven, that I don't love, only like. That's how good the show is. I love everything about it. It is one of my all-time favorite TV shows.<br/><br/>You have to know how good it is. It went for ten seasons which is a lot longer than most comedy's. The only comedy's that have come close, that I've seen are: How I Met Your Mother – Nine Seasons, Full House – Eight Seasons, The Big Bang Theory is currently airing Season 8, and has been renewed for Season 9 and 10. The Simpsons has been going for twenty- six seasons, but that's a cartoon, so it's different. Family Guy has been going for thirteen seasons and American Dad has been going for ten seasons, but both are cartoons. So when you think about it, not many survived that long.<br/><br/>This show centers of six friends, who are living in New York City. We see them fall and rise. We see them love. We see them get married and have babies. We see them break down. We see them go through money and job struggles. We see them reach their goals and dreams. And we see them get happy ever afters.<br/><br/>Here's a run down of who every character is, and what happens to them in the show.<br/><br/>Monica: Is an uptight cleaning freak, but is very lovable. Her catchphrase, "I know!" is hilarious. She is a chef and has trouble talking at a low volume. She is Ross's sister, and Rachel's high school friend. She dates a few people during the show, including Richard and Pete, but mostly dates her brothers best friend, Chandler. They get married, and end up adopting twins at the end of the show.<br/><br/>Chandler: Is a goofy, funny guy who has an job, we don't really know what. He lived with Joey, his best friend, and he uses comedy as a defense mechanism. He dates a few people throughout the show, including Janice, then settles down with Monica. <br/><br/>Joey: Is a silly, hilarious man, who loves to eat and is an actor. He's a ladies man, and his catchphrase, "How you doin'?", gets him into a lot of beds. He lived with Chandler for a few years, and then with Rachel for another few. He ends up falling in love with Rachel, but they don't end up together. <br/><br/>Phoebe: Is a free spirit with a silly personality. She is a masseuse, and doesn't date any of the main characters. She gets very emotional about things, like a mouse dying, and always plays her guitar and wacky songs at Central Perk. She eventually marries Mike.<br/><br/>Rachel: Was a stuck-up rich girl, who tried to live like a normal person. She worked at Central Perk for a few years, then at Bloomingdales and ended up at Ralph Lauren. She dates Ross on-again, off-again for several years. After on hookup, she gets pregnant, and they have a baby together, Emma. They accidentally get married in Vegas whilst drunk and they get a divorce. She ends up moving to another country at the end of the show.<br/><br/>Ross: Is an annoying character, to me anyway. He's a paleontologist. He married a lesbian, which he didn't know. They had a son, Ben. He, his ex-wife, and his ex-wife's current wife, all raise Ben together. He got married to Emily, but accidentally said Rachel's name at the wedding, so that ended things quick. He has a baby with Rachel and they raise her together. <br/><br/>My favorite character is actually a tie, between Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey. They are all hilarious, I love them all. But for some reason, I don't like Rachel that much. I absolutely hate Ross. He's a pain in my ass. Everything he says is pretentious. And he's so rude. When he got evicted and moves into Chandler and Joey's apartment, he keeps telling them to be quiet in their own house. Ugh.<br/><br/>Throughout the show we see many relationships. Ross and Rachel are always on-again, off- again. Monica and Chandler end up dating, getting married, and at the end of the series, adopting twins. Phoebe marries a non-main cast member. Joey never really ended up with anyone, but that is okay.<br/><br/>I love the amount of room changes. They're too many to type, with the word limit, but believe me, there's a lot of them<br/><br/>My brain is just going crazy with all of this Friends knowledge and trivia. And I can't get it all out. So, you've read a synopsis<br/><br/>my opinion, and random trivia. I think that's all you can take, right now.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched Friends by now, you need to. Come on, it's twenty years old, how have you not? Get a copy and watch it now. That's an order :)<br/><br/>Overall, I give this show a 10 out of 10. hi.i see very very much movie i know it's the best.how i met your mother is fine . the big bang ...... is fine . joey is fine . but the friends is excellent it is a long story about six friends . so so so nice . ten season is very much . but you don't tired .it's very good.if you don't seen this movie i say you can't live nice . this movie makes me happy and i love it . my language is not English so sorry for that.hi.i see very very much movie i know it's the best.how i met your mother is fine . the big bang ...... is fine . joey is fine . but the friends is excellent it is a long story about six friends . so so so nice . ten season is very much . but you don't tired .it's very good.if you don't seen this movie i say you can't live nice . this movie makes me happy and i love it . my language is not English so sorry for that.hi.i see very very much movie i know it's the best.how i met your mother is fine . the big bang ...... is fine . joey is fine . but the friends is excellent it is a long story about six friends . so so so nice . ten season is very much . but you don't tired .it's very good.if you don't seen this movie i say you can't live nice . this movie makes me happy and i love it . my language is not English so sorry for that. love this show. Its so amazing. I watch it everyday. It makes me happy. Phoebe is my favorite. My favorite show. I've seen every episode. I know every line. Wish they had a reunion. So ya basically I absolutely love the show. I cannot wait to meet one of them. Well, I might one day. I hope I get to meet one of them. Ross is very funny. I love Rachel. Monica makes me laugh. Joey, oh Joey said 'how you doing?'. And, chandler he's the funniest man in the show! But, phoebe is my absolute favorite character. I have never missed an episode. I have probably over thirty episodes taped on my recording place. One of my favorite episodes is the one with Monica's Boots! I laughed so incredibly hard. Anyway, this is my favorite show and that will never change! It's almost 10 years since Friends is of the air, but even after all the changes and the social networking revolution watching Friends it just makes you laugh, even you watch them for the 100 time. Friends it's the Best and the Funniest Comedy | Romance TV Show ever. It's not just about writing the funniest script, but finding the perfect actress to play the roles and using their unique personal features to develop and advance the show to a next level of TV Shows The actress playing the roles as Spoiled version of themselves, it's just made them very natural in the show. Ross and Rachel relationship it just made the show intrigue, "when they are going to break up, when they are going to get back together" it made the viewers to sit in front of the TV before the show even starts. Friends was really 6 Spoiled friends massing with one another, this made the TV Show legendarily. Funny, Reliable, Incredible, Enjoyable, Neat, Describable, Special are only a few adjectives that can be used to describe the television programme Friends. <br/><br/>The creators of Friends should be commended for their hard work to create the feel of Central Perk- the café, create amazing story lines and realistic characters including Joey's obsession with 'not sharing food'.<br/><br/>The actors of the cast of friends are fantastic and they play Ross, Rachel, Joey, Phoebe, Monica and Chandler with ease.<br/><br/>Friends is one of my favourite programmes and it is a real shame that the producers have not created any more spectacular episodes. I think that Friends is a magnificent television series. It all comes together in a wonderful convergence due to the story lines, characters and humour. For starters, most of the American television series are between 40 minutes and an hour. Friends have a great balance of having each episode 20 minutes. For those who fidget or have a minimal attention span then this is a wonderful combination of quality and time consumption. Not a lot can be said for the locations, lighting and scenery as it all takes place in the same places; Central Perk and Monica's and Joey's apartments. There is the occasional trip taken that include London and Las Vegas. <br/><br/>The story lines can be unrealistic at times but the main plot points are interesting. It raises some important debate topics such as what is meant by being on a break? Whose side do you choice between Rachel and Ross, every much like Jennifer Aniston's film The Break Up. There is also the anticipation of which character will get with whom, for example, personally from series one I wanted Ross and Rachel together, Chandler and Monica and Phoebe and Joey. Another plot line that I found interesting was when Chandler and Monica were secretly sleeping together and the difficulty of keeping it from the rest of the friends. That in my opinion had some of the funniest moments of the show. <br/><br/>The characters are also very convincing and throughout the series they really grow on you. You will develop your favourites, mine was Chandler. His humour and sarcastic jokes had me laughing really hard at times. Monica and Rachel are great as roommates and have their moments. My least favourite characters were Joey and Phoebe but on the scale of things, the show wouldn't be as good without them. <br/><br/>Overall, the series brings laughter, enjoyment, suspense and tears. If you have not yet watched Friends then you are to put it quite simply missing out. 9/10 I've watched the whole 10 seasons for like 10/11 times!<br/><br/>It's a show about Friends, it's a show about life and it's a show about love! And it's pure comedy, seeing that even when you watch episodes over and over you still laugh like it's the first time seeing it!<br/><br/>Friends is a show that changed my life, and i think everyone that watched it just hopes: "I want to have Friends like that, Friends for life that i can count on everything"<br/><br/>I remember being 15 and planning with my friends on moving to USA, probably New York and live like them, because that's the best thing we could (and can) think of! It's a perfect life, without being TOO perfect (well, they have their problems :P)!<br/><br/>Of course, me and most of those Friends grew apart, and that's why i still watch Friends as it is the only real thing i have to rely on REAL friendship! It's a show that inpires me and a show that everyone should watch!<br/><br/>Excellent, very well made and GENIUS! What is so great about this show is that it is so universally loved. Everybody has heard of Friends, I can't think of anyone who doesn't like it, and it's comedy is suitable for both sexes and almost any ages. Even my mom would like this show, and she never watches situation-comedies. Heck, she hardly watches anything American at all! And it's status is well earned. Friends IS very funny. Who can not laugh of Chandler and Joeys crazy situations, ideas and personalities? Who doesn't find Ross's dimwitted ability to make a fool out of himself funny? Who can resist Phoebes eccentricities? Everyone laughs when Monicas competitive instinct takes charge of the situation. And Rachel...yes Rachel. I just saw this episode where she had an infection in her eye, but refused taking eye drops. The other 5 had to bend her down on the floor to get the drops in her eye. That was a big laugh! In addition; Jennifer Aniston is definitely one of this earths most beautiful women, that should count for something to.<br/><br/>If you asked the whole world what the best situation comedy is; Friends would win by a mile. 9/10 I must say that,after watching every(?) episode of this series,I found myself,unlike other shows that went into syndication("Seinfeld","Threes Company","Cheers","Benson" for examples)that I had enjoyed,I had had enough of it. <br/><br/>Maybe it's because the show,a ten year ratings winner on NBC,was SO made over in it's run that by the time it had wrapped,all the "Will Ross and Rahel get together?" and "Will they know about Chandler and Monica?" type questions and plot-arcs,coupled with the make-cute leaps in plot-logic(as mentioned before,the fact that there seemed to be nary a person of color in NYC that the gang of six ran into until about season five or that,despite the fact that all six usually had jobs,they still had an inordinate amount of time to spend socializing at the Central Perk or at their apartments,for examples)had me burned-out on it. Otherwise,I have to say that this show,which was born around the premise of creating a "Seinfeld" for Gen'Xers,actually worked. Worked a lot better than it had a right to be.<br/><br/>In other words,in the hands of different writers and(especially)different actors,this show would've been a leaden wannabe. The whole sextet is strong,with standout s(in my opinion)being Lisa Kudrow as the loopy,eccentric and savant-like Phoebe Buffay,Matthew Perry as the put-upon wiseacre Chandler Bing and Matt LeBlanc as goofy pretty-boy actor Joey Tribbiani. While I'm not sure they merited the million-an-episode they garnered by the show's mid-run,I DO believe that they(and I mean all six of 'em,really) earned the right to being invaluable assets to a hit t.v. show and budding stars in their own rights.<br/><br/>I know that it,like all other popular shows,is now all cataloged on DVD,but my question would be:why buy them? With it in syndication on affiliates all over the country and on National basic cable(TBS),plus the advent of TiVo,it's hard NOT to find reruns of this playing somewhere. Worth a try for any T.V. comedy lover. This is the best; there is no other. Take them all together, all the memorable moments they've made - this is one talented group working here: Crane, Kauffman, and the six friends.<br/><br/>There's no thing greater than laughter - this kind of laughter.<br/><br/>How do you sum up ten years? We haven't seen them all, but will probably buy the DVD set. But we finally saw the concluding episode.<br/><br/>We knew about it; we'd read about it; we knew almost exactly what was going to happen; but still we were kept on the edges of our seats.<br/><br/>And there's a nice twist the producers put on the whole thing in the final moments. No giving away anything here, but it is good, it is fun, and it's very nostalgic.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone working on this series. This is television when it works well like it always should. Thank you for ten years.<br/><br/>We'll miss you.<br/><br/>But hey - are you in a hurry? Maybe we can get a cup of coffee somewhere?<br/><br/>If you know of a good place that is. I've been a fan of this magnificent show for many years of my life now. (wich say a lot, figured i'm born just 5 years before this whole adventure started) I must say, that this i the funniest show ever produced. The storyline, is something special and unique, and it had never been done before. It was about six best friends, living in the big city, and making it on their own.<br/><br/>The friends always make you laugh, and if I have a bad day, I can put on a episode and laugh and forget everything else. And all the characters are funny.<br/><br/>You can't choose a favorite one, cause they're all charming in their own way. Paleontologist, kind of boring geeky but master in weddings , Ross Geller, not-so-funny-but-think-he-is, adorable Chandler Muriel Bing, Goofy, cute Joey Francis Tribbiani, bossy, control freak, caring Monica Geller, goofy, massaging thinks-the-best-of-EVERYONE Phoebe Buffay and fashionably, beautiful and caring Rachel Karen Green.You've gotta love 'em all<3 This is the show you cant go through life not having seen. I, myself, have got all of the episodes on DVD, and i at least watch one episode each day. If you're going to see just one sit-com in you're life, this is the one folks. Don't just sit there, GO AND Watch FRIENDS:D Highly recommended!!!! I have watched many TV shows out there, but none of them compare to how great Friends is. Friends isn't just about having friends, but it's about sharing memories together and having fun times.<br/><br/>The best part, in my opinion, about Friends, is the very last episode of the 10th season. It's really suspenseful and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's also sad at the same time, but I won't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't watched the final episode yet.<br/><br/>I like Monica the best because she's really organized, although sometimes she can be very competitive, but she's a really great character.<br/><br/>What I find weird about Joey is that sometimes, he knows a lot, but other times, he's really stupid; for example, he can't add simple addition in his head, but another time, he can do 100 minus 3. He's a pretty funny character, though.<br/><br/>Rachel is the whiniest character, but it's really hilarious when she whines. It's so real.<br/><br/>Ross is such a nerd! It seems weird that such a cool person like Rachel would fall for him, but that's part of how funny this is! Ross is really funny in his own special way.<br/><br/>Phoebe is one of those characters who is really funny and pretty brilliant as well. She's a great character.<br/><br/>Chandler Bing. Wow. He's a real joker and I think he and Monica go great together.<br/><br/>I wish Friends went on for more than 10 seasons, but oh well.<br/><br/>Friends is the greatest show. =) If I say that Friends make you feel special, happy and wonderful, I speak for many, many people. I really don't lie when I say that Friends made me feel VERY good. When people reed this, they probably think that I am yet another fan boy (which I am off course) and I guess no-one thinks that he/she is "just" a fan and that is the feeling that I am trying to explain.<br/><br/>I seriously don't have words for this series and it just made me feel terrible to see Friends coming to an end, since I (and probably the most people in the world) can't do anything about the fact that it really has come to an end, and as I said, it just made / still makes me feel just terrible. I could go on about the series until the end of time but I can't really be bothered, but I can be bothered to tell you I have never laugh so hard and long at a series as this. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is just too funny, whether I'm sad or depressed, no matter what has happened I watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and I am my happy self again, in fact believe it or not if I'm in bed and I cant get to sleep because depressed, I just sing the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. theme and I get to sleep within a few minutes, its not just funny, its also dramatic in its own little way and all characters, if you watch the show, you just have your own little biographies of all of them inside your head, its just a great feeling you get when you watch it, the jokes are the kind that actually do come up in you and friends daily life and you can really relate to some of the obstacles that lye in their path as they get on with their life. I'm going to finish be stating, F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is the very very very very... best ever!<br/><br/>100 out of 10, if you get what i mean<br/><br/>14 years old<br/><br/>Huge fan of  F.R.I.E.N.D.S. This is the best comedy sitcom ever made,it's hilarious yet still is realistic with a new storyline each episode,and with amazing acting by all six stars. five stars in my opinion this will go down as the best sitcom ever. i find it very funny and as the years have gone on and the characters have got older and matured i think it has got even better. my favorite female charater is pheobe because she is so funny and witty and i thinks shes exellent, my favorite male charater is chandler because he is so funny and sarcastic and he cracks me up. all the characters are good and the actors extremly talented. it will be very sad when it comes to an end. p.s i think jennifer aniston is beutiful. Friends is a model comedy/sitcom. The characters are well defined, each having their own personality and traits unique to them. From Monica's high maintenance to Phoebe's weirdness, the producers of the show have done a good job to ensure Friends never fell into the hashed out old boring theme found in shows such as Mad About You and Suddenly Susan. It reminds me to some extent of a Seinfeld type show, with the show content always being a little obscure in some way. The script is well crafted, the actors portray their character's magnificently and in a way in which most people can relate and while not being slap your thigh and laugh out loud funny, it's entertaining and well worth watching. "Friends" happens to be one of the most humorous sitcoms in today's TV industry. Very watchful due to the funny storylines and loving friendship that each of the six characters give combined with the superstars the show features especially I want to make mention of Courteney Cox Arquette. I tell you Courteney can be my friend anytime, but she also can occupy my view anytime, is she a sweetheart or what? I can agree with People magazine that Courteney is one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in any given year. To bad she's married to David Arquette hey Courteney divorce David and marry me I want you as a mate for life. Just when you think you see beautiful women and more beautiful women something better comes along and that happens to be Courteney Cox for me. Courteney and her fabulous beauty along with her charisma are the most important factors that influence me to watch "Friends". A great show enjoy the humor and Courteney Cox Arquette. Friends is the funniest thing to hit TV. Ever since 1994 when it started it has been my favourite program on TV. Each season gets funnier. It is such a cheerful comedy series.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Green. She ran out on her fiancee Barry in 1994. She then moved in with Monica. She fell in love with Ross. She now lives with Phoebe.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox plays Monica Geller. She is a suffering chef. She is Ross's sister. She thinks that her parents hate her. She hardly has any relationships. She is currently living with Chandler. Chandler is her fiancee.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay. She is a dumb blonde. She has a twin sister named Ursula. Her mother lives on the beach. The woman that she thought was her mom died when she was still young. Her step-father is in prison. She still has not met her real dad.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing. Chandler is the funniest in the show. He used to live with Joey. He was roommates with Ross in high school. He is often thought to be gay. His mother is a famous author. His father is gay. He is living with Monica.<br/><br/>Matt LeBlanc plays Joey Tribbiani. Joey is Italian. He has a large family. He is also very funny. He has chicks crawling all over him. He is a stuggling actor.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer plays Ross Geller. Ross is a very sad individual. He used to work at a museum as a paleantologist. He now lives alone. He used to have a monkey. His ex-wife is a lesbian. His son's name is Ben. He had another wife. He also married Rachel when he was drunk. I think that Friends is the best sitcom to come out of the states since Cheers.  The characters are excellent and I have to say that my favourite is Chandler (Matthew Perry).  He comes up with some great punchlines and I think that his wit is what keeps some of the less exciting episodes going. Everyone plays their respective roles well.  <br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel who at the beginning is seen as a spoiled rich kid.  She eventually changes though, and is now part of the working world. Courtney Cox plays Monica, who sometimes gets on my nerves and is my least favourite character.  She is obsessed with being neat and tidy and sometimes this is really annoying.  I guess that means she plays the part very well. Phoebe is played by Lisa Kudrow and she is definitely my next favourite. She is so unpredictable and next to Chandler, she comes up with the most funny and wacky lines.  Her song "Smelly cat" is one of those songs that just keeps going around inside your head!  <br/><br/>Ross, played by David Schwimmer, is the shy doctor and is Monica's brother. He can have his moments but mostly he just plays off the other characters. Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc, is the next character that I like the most. Joey and Chandler are the funniest duo in sitcom today, I can safely say. When Chandler eventually moved in Monica, the plot lost some of the funnier moments, but thanks to some clever writing, not that much.  My favourite episode has to be "The one with the Prom video".  This shows how Ross wanted to bring Rachel to the prom when her date didn't show.  Rachel sees this video and she and Ross finally get together.  <br/><br/>Friends is definitely a must see and even for people who don't follow the story every week, it is a good watch.  Maybe that's the reason I have EVERY episode on tape! This show is the best thing that has ever happened to TV... Whenever I'm down and I feel crappy, I watch Friends and chill out! Every character in Friends has a certain quality or fault you can relate to. Everybody has experienced one or more of the problems that come up in the show. Therefore it is always helpful to see how THEY cope with it, so you can get something out of it for your own life, well, sort of... It is good entertainment and I can truly enjoy it, over and over again! Let's hope for more seasons and lots of reruns! This is the best show.  My whole family sits around the television and watches it. Also we love watching the re-runs they are as great as the new episodes.  You just get hooked and you are thinking, "Oh, what is going to happen?" I love this show and all of the cast. It is a very great show for the whole family to watch.  I recommend this show to anyone who wants a lot of laughs and enjoyment in a show. Cool show, very Funny. My favourite character is Chandler. The early shows of friends are much better than the latest stuff because it has almost turned into a soap opera. The early shows you could sit down watch an episode, miss the next episode and still be able to watch it. But just recently developments in the characters relationships means that it's too easy to loose the plot. GREAT SHOW THOUGH. I thoroughly recommend it. I started watching Friends near the end of the first season.  (TOW the Ick Factor is the first episode I saw)  I got hooked on it quite quickly.  It is definitely one of the best shows on TV and an argument could be made for it being one of the best sitcoms of all time.  However, with shows like All in the Family, M*A*S*H, Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, and The Honeymooners, that's extremely tough company to break into.<br/><br/>Seasons 1 and 2 had great potential, but the show went downhill in the middle of season 3 and did not pick up again until season 4.  (For episode purposes, I would say the time just after the Turkey Bowl game until the time Joey meets Kathy in season 4.)  Season 5, easily the best season they ever had.  Season 6, if it weren't for the last 4 episodes, would have been something of a disappointment.<br/><br/>I always thought it funny that people in the past (and in the present) said it was a sad copy of Seinfeld.  Friends is one of the few shows in the 90's that WASN'T a copy of Seinfeld. An entire genre of comedian-hosted shows could be listed here, and only a small handful (Home Improvement, Ellen, and Drew Carey) could be considered good.  I always equated Friends to be more along the lines of "Cheers" without a main character.  When you think about the comparisons (bar vs. coffee shop, assortment of different personalities, situations, etc.) I think you'd agree with that.<br/><br/>Best episodes:  TOW Everybody Finds Out (Season 5), TOW The Flashback (Season 3), TOW The Thanksgiving Flashbacks (Season 5), TOW The Prom Video (Season 2), TOW Two Parts (Season 1), and TOW Ross' Wedding (Season 4)<br/><br/>Worst episodes: TOW The Cat (Season 4), TOW The Ultimate Fighting Champion (Season 3), TOW The Unagi (Season 6), TOW The Jellyfish (Season 4), TOW The Bullies (Season 2)<br/><br/>Favorite quotes:  way too many to list, and there's a spot on here for that, anyway. Friends is my all time favourite show, I watched from the beginning of the second series and now own every video up to series six. I don't compare the show to seinfeld because to me, seinfeld was stupid, it was sometimes funny but failed to capture my attention, Friends on the other hand is a show i can relate to, i think everyone our age has a bit of all of the characters in them. I am a definate Friend. 10/10 When Friends first aired, I thought it would be just another stupid comedy series. I had pretty much given up sitcoms for the longest while (except for reruns of Three's Company) so watching this show for the first time in 97 (at the advice of my friend) was a very judgemental viewing. I was going to be critical... ...but I shouldn't have been, because Friends was great and still is great! Now I have seen every single episode, and never miss it! I had never fallen in love with a tv show before I started watching Friends. It's incredible how you start to be a part of the group like you were one of them. When I saw it for the first time, I thought it was very funny and intelligent, I certainly want to see it again, but after the third time I saw it, I just couldn't stop anymore, I watched all the episodes that came after it, and start watching the old ones every day. It became one of the most important things of my life, if for some reason I couldn't see it, I went to bed like something was missing.<br/><br/>There is nothing special about the show and maybe it's the reason why it is so great, you feel yourself at home, suddenly you forget all your problems and feel like you were the seventh one of a group of friends who spend all the time taking the best of the life, even when they are in trouble they never lose the sense of humor. It's a wonderful lesson to be learn, life is so beautiful that we should never waste our time worrying about anything.<br/><br/>Besides that, the cast couldn't be better, we see a connection between them, they are actually friends what makes it more real and they look like normal person, people who could be our friend, they don't look like celebrities. Phoebe is the funniest character, Lisa Kudrow is perfect. Courtney Cox plays my favorite one, Monica is like central of the group, she dates Chandler, is the sister of Ross and she kind of introduce the other girls. The sweet Jennifer Aniston, the talented David Schwimmer, the hilarious Matthew Perry and the great Matt Lee Blanc complete the cast.<br/><br/>So, if you want to have a good time, with the risk of falling in love with a tv show don't miss it. Since its debut in Australia in 1996, imitations of "Friends" have been strewn all along the Australian T.V schedule. It has remained the country's highest ranked T.V show ever since then. This proves the creators MUST be doing something right.<br/><br/>The half hour sitcom provides a hilarious insight into the lives of six now thirty somethings living in well furnished apartments with terrible jobs and equally worse love lives. Its excellence away from the standard pack of comedies is that it doesn't need to try very hard to be funny. Instead of trying to create a fantasy world, the creators wrote exactly about what they knew when they were in their twenties. <br/><br/>All the characters, funny, smart and sexy, are loveable people that we want to know, who we have come to know over the years. Chandler, Joey, Ross, Monica, Phoebe and Rachel have in a sense, become a part of every day life. In its somewhat miraculous conception, the writers have averted the deadliness of favouratism within the ensemble. <br/><br/>In embarrassing ways, the situations these people continually find themselves trapped within the throes of imagination, can be related to on some other level. This remains one of the many reasons "Friends" has deserved success.<br/><br/>As the premiere of the sixth season in Australia dawns, one can only wonder how much longer the freshness and creativity of the sitcom can be sustained. Some of the hilarity in the fifth season has diminished and it will be far better if the sitcom is ended on a high note. <br/><br/>With as much ability and comfort a T.V set can provide, "Friends" is a welcoming, sympathetically moving half hour into another world. It IS a funny sitcom, but not from start to finish. I started watching because my wife said it was worth a look. Yes, Joey & Chandler continually make me laugh, but the others? Not really worth the money I think.<br/><br/>And some of the storylines are very weak. Playing catch all night? Sorry, I must've missed the Joke. This is one of the BEST sitcoms ever! M*A*S*H and Friends share the number one spot on my list of favourite sitcoms. It is great to see that the creative minds behind "Friends" just keep on pouring out great ideas for this fabulous show. I have seen each and every one episode, most of them several times. I'm Friends No'1 Fan!!! All I can say is WATCH IT!!! You won't be dissaoppionted. Every character have their own kind of funnyness, and there's always someone you can relate to. I love Jennifer Anistons' "Rachel", and Matthew Perrys' "Chandler" the best, without them it wouldn't be as good as it is... Take your time (unfortunally only a half hour) and watch Friends. If you missed one of the episodes, just call me, I've taped them all... :-) Unless season 6 turns out to be a total disaster, then "Friends" will probably in my opinion stay one of, if not the best TV show ever. It is with no doubt my favorite half-hour of the week.<br/><br/>"Friends" has all the elements, which make up a sound and solid sitcom. The cast is unbelievably talented. All six of them portray their character so well and unlike many other shows, they have really good chemistry. The scripts are amazingly well written, the dialogue is always sharp and the jokes are consistently funny. I can watch each episode over and over and they will still make me laugh.<br/><br/>Some of the episodes, which deliver the most laughs, are funny enough, those, which really have "no point". For instance, take "The One Where No One's Ready". The whole episode took place on the same set and was about the six of them getting ready to go. Or "The One Where Ross Can't Flirt", where the whole gang is gathered in front of the TV tuned into Law & Order. They even made the episode about throwing a ball funny. And then there were those other episodes, which not only made us laugh, but also touched us. Fans will remember moments from the past such as the kiss in "The One Where Ross Finds Out" and the break-up in "The One The Morning After", which brought cheers and tears.<br/><br/>The show also appeals to such a broad range of viewers. The reason for this is that it is purposely not targeted at a specific audience or generation; all my friends can't live without it, my brother loves it, my mom and her friends watch it and it even entertains my 88-year-old grandmother.<br/><br/>So take six talented young actors, a couple of writers with a good sense of humor and get Kevin Bright, Marta Kauffman, David Crane to produce it and there you have it, "Friends".<br/><br/>The perfect show. Period. Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow keep getting better and better. <br/><br/>
I was sort of disappointed at the way Phoebe lost her scruffy, earth-mother look after the first season (in an effort to make her as trendy as Monica and Rachel, I guess). Chandler, as always, is hilarious but I think Phoebe gives him a run for his money. Ross and Monica Geller are as anal retentive as it is possible to be and still be funny. Joey is the only weak link in this consistently funny sitcom. This show is my favorite.  I watch it everyday that it is on.  I have never seen an episode that didn't make me laugh at least five times.  I would be very, very angry if it were to be taken off air because I need a good laugh each day. First I must say I love Lisa Kudrow more than anyone else. Fan no'1. I love her even more than her mother does.<br/><br/>With that said, I can say that I love all of the cast. The casting is brilliant and the bunch is really completing each other. The story lines are not always great or original, but most of the time they are. The humor is a clever mix of great slapstick and sophisticated jokes. The dramatic bits are also well done and touching without hurting the comedy element. I own all the video cassettes of the series and I watched them over and over again. I know, I'm sick! This is my favorite show of all time. I started watching in the beginning of the fourth season. I instantly fell in love with it (and for some WEIRD reason, I worried I'd never memorize their names!!), and soon caught up on all the episodes I'd missed Seasons 1-3. I think it's kinda depressing the way the writers wrote for Ross & Rachel. She seemed to only want him when he was with someone else . . . and it always ended in heartbreak. Let's hope that they won't get a divorce (remember Ross' NYEve resolution?). As for Chandler & Monica, all I can say is . . . I LOVE THESE TWO! They've had a couple of fights, but they made up right away . . . and I thank the writers for that. I sincerely hope that the show will enjoy MANY more seasons and that Season 6 won't be the last! Its maybe the best series ever. its really fun. My favorite half hour of the week! I love all the six of them. I loved the whole Ross/Rachel thing, glad it's over though. And now the Chandler/Monica thing, they're doing that right, not too serious, more laughs this year. I think the Thanksgiving episode was one of the funniest shows I've seen in the 1990s. You'd think someone getting their head stuck in a turkey would be on some lame sitcom like 3rd rock, but "Friends" did it and I laughed my aÃŸ off. This year was much better than the last 2 years.<br/><br/>All these people don't get "Friends", I don't understand it, how they can't like this show, but I don't understand "3rd Rock" so... What can beat six great actors and the best TV-series screenplay ever, even better than Seinfeld? Well, Friends is the best. Six excellent characters, the youth friendship theme, the perfect role for each actor (representatives of ourselves), the comfortable scenarios, the amazing creativity of the screenplayers, the laughable history of the six and the emotional atmosphere we're (are putted) in are only some of the points I can describe here. Friends don't deserve to be commended, it deserves to be watched. That's all life is about! It's what friends is about! I never thought a tv-series could do this to me. =) This show is really funny. There aren't a lot of shows that can get a laugh after almost every line. But the reason I love it isn't because of the comedy. Well, it mostly isn't because of the comedy. I love this show because of the closeness these six characters share. They go through everything together--good times and bad times. When one of them has a nasty breakup or doesn't get the job, the others are there to support them. It's a show that a lot of people, including myself can relate to. There are a lot of shows about best friends out there, but this is by far the best. I cannot believe these people saying Friends is bad. I think they know a little too much about friends if they're not watching. Hmm? Anyway, Friends in one of the best shows on TV. It's funny and clever. I have to admit it does have some problems. Its a little unrealistic that there are no African Americans in NEW YORK and a few other flaws. I'm sorry but I find Ross so annoying. Why is he friends with these guys but thats O.K. Friends has been in the top ratings all this time which means people like friends. It is a wonderful show and I know its going to end soon but I really hope it stays as long as it can. GO FRIENDS!!!!! GO FRIENDS!!!!!!!! I have never been a big fan of American sitcoms, i think its the dead pan humour of many of them and the fact that most of them were (and still are) the same. Then this came along, different and completely out of character funny as well!  Even though the show is now into series 8, the actors are still funny (although some of chandlers jokes need a lot to be desired but i dont care really!) I have no idea when this show is going to finish, ive heard that its going to series 10! Well long my it continue, im just waiting for phoebe and joey to get together hehe Friends just gets better and better. In the last season I especially noticed the quality of Matt Leblanc's acting. He does more with a double take face shot or turn of a phrase than anyone with a 5 minute dialogue. That said this Ms. Pacman episode was a prime example. The expression on his face with date when she says she looks different at someone by looking at them from behind was an Actor's Studio worthy discussion of how to do a double take. The finale with Rachel in his arms was subtle, heart warming and so real.<br/><br/>What sets Friends apart is how when it's "on" it hits every mark. As strong as the Joey, Rachel storyline in this episode exceled in showcasing three stories. For nostalgia fans the Ms. Pacman was not only hilarious but come on admit it down right true! Who hasn't filled the best off scores with dirty words only to realize "how am I going to get these off?". Lisa Kudrow take a bow.<br/><br/>Finally David Shwimmer deserves a very large piece of credit for this best of the series episode. A show as good as writing may be still must make it visually to the screen. Shwimmer's direction, blocking, close-ups to get Matt and Lisa's performance made the episode.<br/><br/>It appears this may be Friends final season. I'm sure all the cast will continue to have much success. Watch out for Matt Leblanc an untapped major talent. I have been a fan of friends for quite awhile now and I must say- I'm loving it more and more- now I know some may read a bit more into it and dislike it- but people- come on- it's a show that they have on to make you laugh- I think people usually don't get that through their head when they watch it- they judge and criticize when the original purpose is to make you laugh and actually ENJOY it! Yes- I'll admit sometimes Monica can be a little b*tchy and annoying but hey- that's what makes her so funny- and sometimes Joey can be a little stupid but in the end he's still the goofy little sweetheart that's there for Rachel when she needed someone the most. Friends got me through my parents divorce- so now I turn to the show everytime I need a little cheering up because it makes me laugh and just be a little happier- thank you Friends! The title says it all. This is a movie about six friends living in New York City and their escapades while hanging out together. I am just now getting into the series, but I like what I've seen so far. I like the jokes and performances. I recently discovered Friends and realized what i had been missing. Initially i was confused, but soon caught on to all the happenings and "surprises" that often occur.  I have now seen about all 160 episodes, a few more than once, and i LOVED it at first, Joey was so adorable, (and fit, although he has man boobs) and Chandler was good looking and funny with his great facial expressions, now they've both gained weight and are older,less appealing.  Those are my favorite characters......jennifer aniston is funny, but annoying, she plays almost the same character in every job she's been in........Monica Geller is funny, and beautiful, but, slightly MEAN?!?! and seriously, if she were a REAL friend of mine, she wouldn't be around for long.  Don't get me started on Pheobe, at first she was cute even....funny.....now, and especially in the last episode with Monica's Boots, she is SO AMAZINGLY ANNOYING!! i just want to reach into the screen and rip her voice and face out.  And plus, she's like 40 in real life......Ross Geller....yeah, boring, annoying, lousy......etc.....David Schwimmer can pretty much make like TWO facial expressions, the sad face, and the surprised face, oh, and the MAD BECAUSE YOU ATE MY SANDWICH FACE. Okay, i criticize this show, but i watch it, and i laugh, sometimes just because i have nothing better to do, and i can escape into their FAKE, CAREFREE world of LOVE, SEX, AND LUXURY APARTMENTS. I think that Friends, besides Cheers and Seinfeld, has got to be the best show on television. The 8th season is really well written, and the comedy is designed to keep you on your toes. Sometimes the story lines can be a bit unreal, but everyone can relate to them. NBC has done a very good job with the show, and I think that it should run for at least two more seasons. Go Friends! If you are looking for a great show with tons of comedy, romance, love, and excitement this is your show. Meet Rachael, Joey, Ross, Monica, Phoebe, and Chandler in this never ending sitcom. Watch how they take on life in their apartment, in the coffee house, or even in the fat ugly naked man's house, now Ross's apartment. Check out the new Friends every Thursday on NBC at 8:00 Eastern Times. It won't be a mistake.<br/><br/>Five out of Five I have watched Friends for a long time, and I have to say that it is one of the best shows on the air today.  It is a down-to-earth comedy about six friends who live in New York.  They all follow the trials and tribulations of love, work, and being the best thing of all...friends.  This is a show that I, personally think, will live on for ages to come. Friends is my favorite show. I can't remember an episode that I haven't laughed at. This show is so down to earth. I like it because it deals with real life situations. This show is MUST SEE TV!!!!! Even though it went somewhat downhill this past season, Friends still is one of the best, funniest and most reliable shows on TV. All of this thanks to its ensemble (the best comedic ensemble by far on TV) and by its top notch writers who always manage to come up with good storylines every season. True be told, this past season the show declined somewhat in quality, but seasons 1-6 are easily brilliant, hilarious, with terrific storylines and smart writing. One of the best sitcoms ever. This is my favorite television Show! I have almost seen every episode, I watch it EVERY Thursday and the re-runs everyday. It is hilarious and should run forever! If you have never seen this show you have no idea what you're missing! If you don't like, then there must be something wrong with you! This show is made by amazingly clever and efficient crew and to top it all, six great actors. I fail to understand why everyone hates David Shwimmer. According to me he is a great actor and my favorite among the 6, He along with Matthew Perry form the heart of the show. This is a GREAT show. In the beginning i watched it every week on the tv. After moving to a student campus with no television cable is bought almost all their videos (still buying) and i watch all there episodes over and over and over again. Even while i now what is going to happen i can't stop laughing. The show gives me a good feeling because it feels so real. From the first minute i start watching i am completely out of this world. The actors are very good, and i think they are all doing a great job. Even if David isn't such a good actor in movies, this roll of Ross is perfect for him. I would lie if i say he is the best, because in every episode they all are great. Then i like Chandler the most, then i like Joey, they all have a great experience. I think they should all keep acting together in Friends.<br/><br/>I would rate this show a 10 out of a 10, the only show that comes close to this one is Seinfeld. Hey all you flik fans, Friends, already in their 8th season, has been a great success, and i agree it will stay that way for a long time.  Chandler, the funny but very romantic guy, Ross, the shy dork science guy, Joey, the just plain stupid but super funny and excellent (who can't love Joey) guy, Monica, the neat-freak down-to-earth-y girl, Rachel, the hot and crazy, but also smart girl, and (last but definitely not least) Pheobe, the clueless, ditzy, (smelly cat... lol)guitar playing dumb blonde.  And, All together, these 6 "friends" make up the funniest TV series ever!  I just hope they stay together..... :-(   We love you guys!  Keep on Rockin! I really like the show, it's fun, the stories are great and the jokes are funny. Monica is great and she's strong. The boys are my favorite: all 3 of them and they are great friends. Unfortunately, one character ruins everything: Rachel Green. She doesn't know what she wants, she's playing Ross all over again and brakes his relationship with amazing girls. What is up with that? She ignored all the hints Ross gave her that he'd like her since forever. And then even though Ross had a new girlfriend...she seduces him. Eventually Ross breaks up his great relationship to be with Rachel, after which she doesn't want him anymore... Also, Rachel breaks up (because Ross was just the normal great boyfriend for wanting to see her once a week, on their anniversary), gets mad when he gets comfort somewhere else and calls him a cheater... I want to look to a woman and say: "I want to be like her." Rachel is everything I don't want to be. That's annoying. It's even sad because girls these days will think "not knowing what to want and playing boys is perfectly fine" . She irritate, don't know A of acting... When she come on screen have to fast forward to ruin my mood.. who ever wrote her character and cast her is don't know what he's doing.. all 5 others going east and she's going west with her rubbish and irritating face expressions and moving hands like she don't know else to do.. third class punch lines by her.. Probably the unfunniest programme ever. The humour is childish and the characters so irritating. AVOID This show isnt even worth 1 star. Bad actors bad Story line etc etc Yes, I had friends who loved Friends.
I, however, was not one of them. Whether it's because I found the entire premise to be far fetched and antidotal or because I disliked the characters themselves, I can't be certain. Each of the troupes were shallow and flat no matter how 'good' the actor or actresses were when attempting to breathe life into them.
Not unlike other shows which dominated the airwaves, it was not a 'must see' and I found better use of my time.
That hasn't changed. Age hasn't improved it.
This is still an empty, hallow time waster. When ever I saw friends on TV I would shiver in lame.<br/><br/>The show looked so bland and boring. They were generic characters doing generic things. Unlike Seinfeld. Seinfeld was like a cool, fun, awesome, no limits show.<br/><br/>You can come home after a long day pop a beer open and just chill to Seinfeld. Friends on the other hand one look it it turns you into lame. This is literally seinfeld but less funny and made to be more mainstream friendly.<br/><br/>Would not recommend if you are over the age of 17. "Friends" are so unfunny. Worst 20 minutes of my life. I am so angry that I spent my time to watch this trash. 1/10 would not recommend to anyone. Simply the best tv show created. Genius casting, acting, writing...everything. It will remain relevant while showing new generations that life was great before everyone married a mobile device... Frankly, that's the highest praise you'll ever give a show that went 10 seasons.<br/><br/>This show, of course, is filmed in front of a live studio audience. And there's a reason so many comedies do that. While it seems distracting (until you get used to it), it actually does something almost sinister. It makes a show seem funnier than it actually is. Laughter is more contagious than any disease on earth, so when we hear a studio audience cracking up, we will, too.<br/><br/>That being said, this show is genuinely funny - but not because of the writing. Sure, the writing can be great (the "Backpacking in Eastern Europe" story is a standout in fantastic writing, as is "The One With the Embryos"), but surprisingly, the thing that makes this show so damn funny is the actors. And it's one of the only comedies that operates this way.<br/><br/>The vast majority of comedies work because of the writing (think "Malcolm in the Middle," "How I Met Your Mother," "Master of None," "30 Rock," "Modern Family"). There are a few rarities that work because of the directing (think "Arrested Development" and "The Office"), but "Friends" is pretty much the only one (although the Office does too, a little) that works because of the acting.<br/><br/>For me, the funniest moments in the show are all attributed to the actors' performances. These include Rachel coping with Ross' new Girlfriend in early S2 (Julie! Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch- spit-on-your-neck-fantastic!?), Chandler and Phoebe's career performances in "The One Where Everybody Finds Out," Monica crying in "Rachel's Going Away Party," Joey Speaking French, and of course, the ALL-TIME FUNNIEST PART OF THE SHOW, Ross being "fine!" and spelling out the word L-O-V-E in his intense state of denial.<br/><br/>But beyond the acting and a few other moments of great writing, the show doesn't offer any real heart. I enjoyed the episodes with Ross and Rachel, and Chandler and Monica, but not because I was invested in their love stories, because they used great jokes in those episodes. <br/><br/>And at the end of the day, that's the show's largest weakness: the characters. The six mains are either complete stereotypes, or have no real personality. I'll show you.<br/><br/>Ross: The only consistent thing about him is that he's a nerd. But in any given episode, he's barbaric, romantic, rational, insane, or anything else you could attribute to a human. Weak character. Rachel: Also has no personality. She's spoiled, but other than that, nothing, really. She's also too down-to-earth for her own character at times. Monica: A stereotypical control-freak, neat-freak, competitive type. No other depth. Joey: Stereotypical ladies' man. All about the ladies, dumb as hell, but a child at heart. Makes for good comedy, but not good television. Phoebe: Literally just the oddball in the group. Not only are the throw-away jokes about her past contradictory to each other almost constantly, so are her personality traits, the things she says and does -- and oh yes, she's very funny...until there's an episode devoted to her.<br/><br/>You'll notice I left Chandler out of that. And that's because Chandler is actually a really good character. At first, it seems that Chandler is just a way for the show to deliver stand-up-style jokes, but it works because that's exactly who Chandler is. He uses humor as a coping mechanism, and as he says, "it's all I have." While that's really only two layers of personality, that's twice as many layers as everyone else on the show, so kudos.<br/><br/>My other note, neither criticism nor praise, is just an observation worth sharing: in my opinion, the show peaked from Seasons 3-6. It took a while to find itself completely, and fell flat towards the end, but those four seasons are truly great. The best one is S4.<br/><br/>You're probably thinking I'm being to critical of the show. But I gave it an 8/10. That criticism would bring a drama down to a 5, maybe a 4. But after it all, "Friends" is a comedy, and it's purpose is to make people laugh, and in that, it succeeds admirably. It remains a funny show on multiple viewings. It's humor got it to an 8. The only thing that kept it from a 10 was quality and depth (and don't think that comedy can't be deep and funny -- look at "Modern Family" and "Master of None").<br/><br/>8.4/10. As far as comedies go, this one's damn good. Ross was a huge tool to Rachel more than 3 times, which is why I never got the reason why the writers decided to make those 2 characters end up with each other. Their chemistry seemed forced to me. When a show "forces" a couple together from an audience annoying the writers enough about it, that is when the show weakly sucks up to people's expectations about what it is supposed to represent to me. Which is why I stopped liking Friends before season 6. Monica and Chandler had a natural chemistry to me while Ross and Rachel did not. Also, I wished the writers would have left both Phoebe and Joey to be unwed throughout the seasons. That would have made both of their characters more interesting to me. All in all, this show was great before season 6 happened for my experience. Friends is the best sitcom of all time and maybe one of the best shows of all time, the writing and jokes are timeless and just phenomenal. All the characters have unique personalities and their own catchphrases, my favourite ones are Ross's like "WE WERE ON A BREAK" or "MY SANDWICH". Chandler and Ross are my favourite characters and my least favourite character is Phoebe, mainly because she has way too many relationships that don't end very well and after a while you just stop caring.<br/><br/>Another negative thing I have to say is that by season 6 or 7 you can definitely tell that they're running out of ideas and that the show is getting a little stale. A few examples are the many flashback episodes that occur in the later seasons and dozens and dozens of pointless relationships the characters have which barely last 2 episodes. But the quality does get higher again for the last few seasons.<br/><br/>Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the series and it's hilarious characters. Did you know? Because of a bet between Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis, on the set of the "Whole Nine Yards", (which Perry won), Willis did a two-episode guest role for free. There are many more trivia facts like this one at endedtvseries com<br/><br/>Joey's pick-up line, "How you do-in'?" was ranked at #4 in T.V. Guide's list of "T.V.'s top 20 catchphrases".<br/><br/>Matt LeBlanc's character "Joey Tribbiani", plays "Dr. Drake Ramoray" on a fictional version of the NBC soap opera "Days of Our Lives". Jennifer Aniston's father in real-life plays "Victor Kiriakis" on the actual "Days of our Lives". This is a show which is created to attract teenage group especially girls. A show which revolves around six people who lives in New York. They come from different settings but somehow they connect with each other and lives a happy life.. the end. Sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it? Well, the show has good moments, witty jokes and sometimes does deliver wonderful situations of mishap created by guest actors. This show which was created in the 90's have certainly gained a lot of popularity even in the 2010's modern era, all thanks to the blissful internet and it's piracy and free streaming services provided by lots of websites. More than fifty percent adolescent people has spent their time watching this show and they wants to relate to it. I won't deny the fact that I've some best times watching this show in my time and I did wanted to relate to even though it's not relatable most of the time. If you want to have an amazing time depending on who you are and what period of life you're living, this show might be the next thing you want to watch. I firstly watched this show in almost 10 ago before just the year when it ends. I found it quite entertaining but a little bit dated. You know, especially the oldest seasons.<br/><br/>However, in the following years, when I was bored, I picked some episodes time by time. Gradually, I found it's more than funny stuff for me. It may sound weird and too serious, but I really found it's kind of touching and moving. <br/><br/>Something in the stories is so beautiful.Don't wanna to, but I have to admit that there were tears sometime. I just love all the characters, all the kindness and positiveness in those stories.<br/><br/>It's been 10 years, no matter how familiar with the story, I still enjoy every episode in this show. Sounds a little bit pathetic maybe, but I think I just do and will love this show. <br/><br/>Best TV show ever! Hi everyone! This is really nice page, and i really like the "Friends" show! I also want to share link to my website ( www.fansoffriends.com ), it's about Friends too. It's my first work, so please don't judge so hard. My website contains some information, pictures and all the seasons of friends. That's not cheating, you can watch online all the episodes of Friends and you don't really have to get through the registration or anything like that. I Just wanted to try myself as a web designer and created source about my favorite TV show. Comments on the website are appreciated. <br/><br/>Thank you! An amazing sitcom people are saying that Seinfeld is better but in my opinion, Seinfeld has nothing on Friends. Friends is hilarious, Joey the Dumb and Gullible one. Chandler: The sarcastic one. Monica: The control freak. Rachel: The dramatic one Ross: The clever one. Phoebe: Bubbly and Tough. The biggest dramatic relationship is between Ross & Rachel. They have had many of fights, a point where you have to pick which team you're on team Ross or team Rachel. Makes you have to think about what you want to do about it, you feel connected to the characters and the show ran for a good ten years. I felt as if a piece of me died inside when I saw the last ever episode for the first time. It was heartbreaking that's how much you connect with the characters.<br/><br/>All in all filled the whole circle. Friends is like breakfast, You have it every morning but next morning you still want to have it...No matter how many times you watch it, It is still funny even if you know all the words and punch lines!<br/><br/>I can say it does not have the best acting or story lines but it has addiction...after watching it you end up creating a strong connection with it, it feels as thou these 6 people are your friends and you can totally connect with them.<br/><br/>Surely it is a huge disappointment that is finished but in my mind it can never end.<br/><br/>All in all do not watch it, coz once you do, you can never walk away! It can be the best TV comedy ever. I literally crack up in every line. The plot is well written, the characters are well-developed. Even the supporting characters, like Gunther, is yummy to watch. They succeeded in not only making a sitcom, but also making it live. After several seasons, I feel like I do know them. It's not like you're watching a show. It's like you set a secret camera to stalk on your dear six irritating but very interesting neighbors. At first i love one character, then turn to another, now I can't decide. I love them all!!! I do recommend Friends to everyone. But be wary, it can take you like a useless week, doing nothing but watching it. It's really addictive. there were Siti-Coms....there are Siti-Coms.....there will be Siti- Coms....but there wont be anything like "friends"....each character stood out...the show has its legacy and that will Alwz last... even after 20 years u see the episodes being played on various channels... joey is my all time favorite...its surprising that the characters have moved on but still they are identified with their names in friends..."How U Doin?"...this line just breaks u into laughter...Ross, Chandler,Rachel,Pheobe and Monika are more than just characters...even the character of Jenice which only appears occasionally in the show is amazing...just the way she laughs makes u go crazy...a story of friendship,love,care,emotions and being there for each other...<br/><br/>the show was top-notch...one of the finest shows ever!!!! Well where to start... I have to say that friends is one of the greatest sit com to be on Television, if you haven't seen at least one episode you haven't lived! Every episode never fails to make me laugh, i wish they still made it now. I personally think they should bring out a film, with all the originally actors of course otherwise it just isn't friends. I say they all never fail to make me laugh but there is always one that makes me cry and that is the final episode, it was clearly so thoughtfully and cleverly thought out, i think it was just such a wonderful way to end 10 years of greatness, i do love however that even in that last couple of minutes they got one last laugh in. Overall i miss friends even though i can watch it when i want i don't think its always the say. Bring out Friends the Movie! Friends was a massive TV show back in the late 90's and early 00's and is still regarded to this date as being one of the best TV shows ever created. It follows 6 friends and their lives living in Manhattan.<br/><br/>I'm young. And so, this show isn't so big anymore. But I still managed to watch every episode of every season and I must admit - I love it. The characters are great and are well acted by each. The story lines are very good and the jokes are hilarious.<br/><br/>I think the mid-seasons are the best, as they give Ross more funny episodes and the laugh track is used less. If I have one complaint it's this - The laugh track is used a bit too often. - A lot of the jokes are funny but not every little thing they say. However, they stopped using it so much as the seasons went on. <br/><br/>Each episode is interesting and they created characters we all love and are somewhat different. It is continuous with the laughter and I haven't seen a bad episode. I just finished watching 10 seasons of FRIEND. It touched me so much that i wanted to appreciate it. It does not feel good that it,s finished i wonder why they stop making this i mean you don,t want to stop watching this. It,s so hilarious that you can,t stop laughing at some scenes. It,s the best comedy i have ever seen and wonder why i didn,t see it before. The characters are so attractive and the performance is so great that you start to feel for them. I am not American i did not understand some of the native jokes but still i enjoyed at thoroughly. My favorite character and i think the most funny was Joey, Ross was great i mean everyone was truly amazing i wish i could meet them all. Friends has always been one of the most beloved programs of all time and their's no trouble seeing why, every episode is filled with laughs; situations we can relate to , happiness and sadness. I love waking up in dusk with the amazing rising sun.<br/><br/>The characters are amazing and these six friends resemble my life with my friends and each of us have almost the exact same personalities. i'm sure you are all familiar with the characters as the shows soo famous nowadays.<br/><br/>The first three seasons were just pure laughs and was the shows prime time and was overtaking 'Seinfield' and won! Then it picked up on more drama for the next 4 seasons and created some of the most iconic moments in TV history. My personal favorite is the last three seasons as their VERY shocking and more funny.<br/><br/>This is show is the best ever and almost as good as Dr Who. Friends is a American television series that started way back in the early 90's and is about six friends named Rachel Green , Monica Geller , Phoebe Buffay , Joey Tribbiani , Chandler Bing and last but not least Ross Geller,they live in new york. Ross Geller and Rachel Green are the main Characters sort of.<br/><br/>Rachel Green- the Sweet, hot female of the Group female(second least favorite) <br/><br/>Monica Geller- "Mom" of the group(my least favorite)<br/><br/>Phoebe Buffay- the unpredictable weird hippie type(fourth best Character)<br/><br/>Joey Tribbaini- unbelievable Stupid, the Homer of friends (second best Character) <br/><br/>Chandler Bing - the sarcastic loser who always making jokes(my Favorite just little little better then Joey)<br/><br/>Ross Geller- a nerd who seems always getting him into some kind of mess(my third Favorite)<br/><br/>Friends ran for 10 years and ended in 2004 sadly, but many people still watch it including me, I personally have watched friends nearly six times and have recommend it to many of people I know all of them have watched to the end and loved it.<br/><br/>I Only discover friends 3 years ago(2009), i was not born in 1994,1995 but Friends still Managed to get my attention 15 years after is premiere<br/><br/>I recommend Friends to everybody, i gets a 10/10! I have to admit... I must have watched about 90% of all 'Friends' episodes on SKY when it originally aired and I loved every single one of them, apart from the last one.That one seriously upset me! Simply because it was the last one! Then I got the series on DVD, and during bouts of unemployment or holidays I would just watch them non-stop. This sitcom is just timeless as far as I am concerned!! :-) Even though I nearly know plenty of the dialogs by heart, I still break a smile at the best jokes!! The comedy is very well written and the actors just let it shine! After season 2 they meshed so well it was just inevitable the ratings went through the roof.<br/><br/>If there are people out there that have missed 'Friends' just do yourself a favor: watch it! NOW! After watching and re watching this show endlessly, I think I have finally figured out why this show is as amazing that it is:<br/><br/>1. Excellent writing- Unlike most sitcoms, friends combines nearly all types of comedy while still managing to pull at your heartstrings in many ways forcing you to care about the characters. The combination of these things makes this show appealing to virtually anyone, so that 3 people with 3 different types of humor will all be able to find something that makes them crack up.<br/><br/>2. Acting- Each of the six lead actors play their character superbly and really embody their characters. For example, Jennifer Aniston is a very famous actress now, but still when I watch friends, I refer to her as Rachel, not Jennifer. With these 6 actors comes 6 different types of comedy. Joey(Matt LeBlanc) has the dumb person comedy going, Rachel(Jennifer Aniston) works the spoiled girl next door comedy, Chandler(Matthew Perry) has the punchline and sarcastic comedy, Phoebe(Lisa Kudrow) does the honest hippie goofy comedy, Ross(David Schwimmer) does the physical/dramatic comedy, & Monica(Courtney Cox) has the up-tight obsessive competitive comedy.<br/><br/>and each of these actors has perfected their portrayal of said types of comedy<br/><br/>3. Chemistry- possibly the deciding factor of if a show will work or not, does the cast have great chemistry on and off screen? And it is blatantly obvious that the 6 'friends' were/are real friends because it shines through the chemistry they share on screen with one another. This is also the reason the jokes work. It wouldn't be believable and probably not funny without this.<br/><br/>With the backbone of incredible writing, actors who are masters of their character, and the chemistry that binds it all together, there is no doubt the show will be amazing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, friends is not your typical sitcom because it combines all styles of comedy, allowing all viewers to find a laugh but it also has characters and story lines that are not just surface level.<br/><br/>if you have not seen friends I suggest you watch it if for no other reason than to be a part of the world of inside jokes that are nearly common knowledge to the world today. Friends is a funny series and I'm pretty sure no one doubts that but what truly cuts it for me is that it has the ability to produce such touching moments like the death of mr.heckels, the part where Joey leaves the apartment and Especially the ending. Another great thing I like about the show is that there isn't a main character so you just pick the character you like the most and that you identify with and you pay extra attention to that character. With 6 "main" characters you would think that there wouldn't be any room for side characters but with episodes of only about 25 minutes the show still manages to balance the six main characters, the side characters that appear from time to time and the special guests that are more than common. And did I mention the theme song rocks? Anyways with all that said I truly believe Friends is the best sitcom ever made. Best comedy I ever watched! Looking forward to see next or new season. I hope that producers will make new season :-).<br/><br/>I've been watching in my tablet during last quarter. All episodes very good to have fun :-).<br/><br/>Gunther proposing to Rachel was genius! I find it great, and also because it was right before Ross.<br/><br/>We also get to see Joey's ass covered in red paint that left a stain on Monica's couch and Phoebe making it a musical <br/><br/>And the end of this part is also great because Ross finally decides that he doesn't want to get over Rachel and goes after her!<br/><br/>Thank you very muck producers. By the my fav. was Monica I'd like to have her made cookies KKK.<br/><br/>Gantulga I'm a 16 year old and i didn't grow up watching Friends but now when i started watching it for the past 2 years (some channels in India air friends now also) i came to notice that Friends is totally different from the comedy shows made in our generation like two and a half men, how i met your mother, etc. It totally stands out from the rest. No matter how many times you see a single episode you never get bored. That's not the thing with today's comedy shows. For example, if you see an episode of How I Met Your mother twice you would laugh on the same jokes, you watch it the third time you still laugh a little and then the fourth you actually find it boring. But i don't know what it is about Friends: the acting or the jokes or the awesome characters that makes you laugh every time you see them. Friends was truly a classic sitcom and i really wish they would make a comeback.. In fact, in my personal opinion i think that the actors should have kept the show going till they turned 50... Oh and another advice- never watch the last episode more than once... it really breaks your heart for the fact that Friends will no longer be aired... I absolutely love this show. I own all 10 seasons and have watched all of the episodes several times, and they never get old. But instead of rambling on about how awesome this show is, I will disprove some of the things people in negative reviews have said: <br/><br/>1. They could never afford those apartments. I guess that would be true, especially for Monica and Rachel in the earlier seasons while Rachel was a waitress and Monica was unemployed, but those people have obviously never seen many of the episodes. Monica's grandmother owned the apartment before her, so it costs her nearly nothing to live there. Ross is a professor, so he makes plenty of money to afford his apartment. Chandler also makes good money, and he has a roommate to split the cost. Phoebe also has a roommate, though we never met her.<br/><br/>2. The couches are always available in the coffeehouse. In some of the episodes people are getting up from the couches just as they are coming in, and in "The One with the Bullies" there IS someone sitting in their spot, and Ross and Chandler have to fight for their right to sit there. There were also some occasions where they weren't sitting at the couch when only one or two of the group were at the coffee house. And it's a TV show. It doesn't have to be completely accurate. <br/><br/>3. Ross and Rachel would never be together (aka, Rachel is so much hotter than Ross). Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If you say that, you would also say that Chandler and Monica would never be together since Monica is much prettier than Rachel and Ross is more attractive than Chandler. The girls fell in love with them more for their personalities than their dashing good looks.<br/><br/>4. The title "Friends" is incredibly unimaginative. OK, so a show about friends is called "Friends". So what? A show about the Simpson family is called "The Simpsons", show about about an office is called "The Office", and shows about guys named House and Seinfeld are called "House" and "Seinfeld". No one is saying those shows have stupid names! <br/><br/>5. A show just about the everyday lives of 6 friends is boring and stupid. Hello! What do you think "Seinfeld" is about??? I love that show too, but it's stupid that people write that a show about friends is stupid and how much they love Seinfeld in the same review.<br/><br/>6. Their characters never mature through the 10 years the show takes place. Yes they have! They get better, more stable jobs. They get married. Have kids. Move out of the city. Etc. All of the things that normally happen between the ages of 25 and 35. Joey does remain immature, but that's part of his character.<br/><br/>7. The actors are terrible. Ummm, obviously not true since they've all won numerous awards for their performance in the series. The only bad actor is Joey (NOT saying Matt Leblanc's a bad actor), but again that's just part of his character.<br/><br/>I love this show and it will probably always be on of my favorites. Some of the episodes are better than others (two of my favorites are "The one with the unagi" and "the one where no one's ready"), but that's true for all series. Friends has been my favourite show for years. I grew up watching this show, and now grown up, I still watch and laugh the same way as I did back then. I've come to really love the writers and especially the cast. Rachel, the glamorous, stubborn, hilarious one. Phoebe, the silly, corky, hilarious one. Monica, the perfectionist, loving, hilarious one. Ross, the smart, geeky, hilarious one. Chandler, the joking, self-cautious, hilarious one. And Joey, the Italian, lady's man, hilarious one. As you can obviously tell, I've said that everyone is hilarious, which is true. These six characters are what make this show so funny, and make me laugh every time I watch it. Especially Phoebe. I feel like every comedy should have a Phoebe. I've gone through many memories with this show. I take this show everywhere I go whenever I travel. I even keep it playing on my TV while I sleep. It's just a very comfortable, familiar show which I enjoy watching a lot. I mean, I watch this show A LOT. I've watched it so much, that I know what every episode is about. Whenever it's on TV, I know which episode it is, and I say what the title is and what season it's from. It's a great show to pass the time, and you'll never get bored of it. It brings laughs, tears, and sometimes both at the same time. I'm definitely never going to stop watching this show, no matter how many times I've watched all 10 seasons.<br/><br/>I advise this to everyone out there. This is a must see show! If God had created a show for everyone to enjoy and love, it would be something similar to Friends. There surely can be no doubt that Friends will go down in history as one of the best sitcoms ever. Sure it perhaps went on a little too long and the series gradually became more and more like a soap opera but it is important to remember why this show was such a hit and why people watch it again and again and laugh equally hard each time.<br/><br/>From the on and off again Ross and Rachel relationship to the buddy love of Joey and Chandler the stories flow effortlessly from episode one until episode two hundred and thirty six. The cast are on top form through thick and thin and regardless of what they have done since or will do in the future they will always be remembered for Friends. I have read a lot of reviews and comments. Many of them really liked the show and some of them criticised for the unreal nature of it, but I for one think that this is the best comedy serial there ever has been on Television.<br/><br/>The first season sets up the tone for the rest of the 9 seasons. Never through out the 10 seasons it feels like the writers ever introduced something unworthy, something just to add up to the episode list, something just to pile up the story. <br/><br/>I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the first season when the seventh season was being aired but from then on I was hooked.<br/><br/>I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone who just loves laughing and don't wish it to stop. I would also like to advice that never watch this show while having lunch or dinner as it can mess with your digestion because of the laughing. ;) I started watching them in the 97's but didn't got in to them until that much until the year 2000. I loved them so much that every time I sow a new episode I asked my self what em I going to to when It end's.I have seen every episode many times and I have never yet seen anything as good as this show. Although I love shows like: ,,my name is earl,scrubs,The IT Crowd,Monty Python's,house and lie to me'' they still do not come close to friends.The comedy is excellent and the acting is amazing. It's not until recently that I heard that many people compare It to Seinfeld. I was shocked. Seinfeld isn't that funny compared to the shows like the ones I already mentioned (My name is earl,scrubs,The IT Crowd,Monty Python's,house and lie to me) but to compare It to Friends. The other thing which is great about friends is that the are a lot of guest celebrities on this show like Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and a lot of others.It is a show funny for viewers of any age and to me It still continues to be the best show so far. I must have watched the whole of friends 4 or 5 times, and it is still incredibly funny. The actors are funny and they play of each other fantastically, and the story lines are great. But what also makes it wonderful that it can also be it can go from funny to sad in moments. I don't understand how some of you people can say that the show is awful. OK, maybe for some people it is not the best show ever, but to say it is the most overrated show ever, now that is over the top!<br/><br/>Whenever i have had a bad day, I just pull out a DVD of the series and watch an episode. It can lift you so much with laughs around every corner. Even the theme tune is brilliant. <br/><br/>Everything about this show is masterclass, and it deserves every award that it ever got. I actually think that it deserved more awards!!<br/><br/>This show will live forever, and will never stop making us laugh! Friends' greatest strength is that it invites us into a lifestyle that we'd want to live. You've got your six friends, and they're all you need, and you're always having a good time. No, the show isn't always funny. Certainly, no, it's not always smart. But, at the end of the day, it's always a place you'd love to be a part of, and that's why it's worthy of high acclaim.<br/><br/>The first couple of seasons of the show were comprised of mostly entirely interesting episodes. Afterwards, the episodes were mostly good - albeit with usually at least one boring, obligatory plot line - and come the final few seasons, most of the comedy got downright stupid (the episode where Phoebe tries to teach Joey French is embarrassing) and you could tell the writers were clutching at straws.<br/><br/>Again, though, despite these flaws that need to be addressed, the show was always worthwhile. Matthew Perry, Courtney Cox and Jennifer Aniston (who, circa 1995-1996, was one of the most beautiful women to ever walk the Earth) were stand-outs, and David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow were good as well. For all the flaws one could find with the program if they tried, no one can question the chemistry between the principal actors. Combine that with the memorable settings and supporting players, and you're left with a splendid show that's more of a dumb escape from real life than anything else. As one of the most devoted Seinfeld fans in the world, I avoided Friends like the plague for years. Though I heard many people loved it, I felt as if I would be committing treason if I were to watch it. After all, "Friends" versus "Seinfeld" is a common debate when people are discussing the top sitcoms of all time. And I was firmly entrenched on the Seinfeld side. That is, until I actually watched an episode. I'm not sure exactly how it came about, but I eventually ended up watching a Friends episode. I hated to admit it, but it was quite funny. Ah, yes, I think I remember how it happened; TBS airs Friends immediately after the Seinfeld reruns I always watch, and I guess I just didn't end up changing the channel. Boy, I'm glad I didn't. After enjoying that first episode, I decided to watch it the next day. And the next. And the next. Then I started Tivoing every episode that aired (which is quite a few, something like five or six Friends episodes are on a day, it's kind of absurd) and watching them in bunches. About a week later, I was hooked. And about 150 episodes later, I'm making my way through them all and convinced that this deserves its place right alongside Seinfeld in the comedy pantheon. There are even certain aspects of Friends which are better than Seinfeld (as difficult as that is for me to admit). Whereas Seinfeld has the edge in each episode's rewatchability factor and quotability, Friends has characters and plot lines that we care about more. The six friends actually appear inseparable and more like our personal friends than the cast of Seinfeld. The cast is pitch perfect, just like Seinfeld's; you can't imagine any other actor in any of the main roles. So, while it may have taken me a couple more years than it took most people, I finally came around on Friends. If you're one of those who haven't, maybe it's because you were a devoted Seinfeld fan like me and couldn't bear to hear the two shows compared. Do yourself a favor; if you haven't watched Friends, give it a shot. I'm sure you'll be hooked in a week. For many years I have watched shows where producers try to make a show last a long time, and give people what they are looking for. Many fail and very few succeed such as Scrubs and Two and a Half Men. This shows are all good. But there is no show ever created that can sum up to what 'Friends' was.<br/><br/>It was the best series I ever watched in my life. Luckily I have the whole set so I can watch over. I have seen every single episode about 10 times....(True Fact) and yet I can watch them again. I Guess the show appeals to the emotions and maybe something that you have experienced with your life that attracts you to the storyline. I still don't know 1 person who dose not like these series. Now there is some hype going around as to a movie being made. Im not too sure whats going on, but if a movie was made, I'd be the first one to see it. All episodes are unique in their own way, and all have a well executed beginning, middle, end, complication and resolution.<br/><br/>I felt that I had to write this comment as a tribute to these actors, writers and the series they have managed to make. It truly was an excellent experience, and made a big impact on the way I think about some stuff. I know that may sound extreme but I loved that show, and others who do, would also feel the same way. All I can say is thanks, and a job very well done. Just perfect. A masterpiece show, which will never die in my memories. when i first saw FRIENDS on TV... i have no feelings at all.. because at that time, i don't understand a word of English.. so, i didn't understand what are so funny about them..<br/><br/>then i went to university.. learned English.. One day i found a CD case of FRIENDS season 5 at movie store.. i don't realize that i bought the CD case until i found it next to my laptop at the evening..<br/><br/>then i watch it.. it's funny.. watch it again.. hilarious.. watch it again and again.. amazing, I've never feel bored watching them..<br/><br/>now that i saw all the season, i miss them so much.. he he.. hope that show never end..<br/><br/>FRIENDS forever... Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, Joey.. Love you guys.. WOW!<br/><br/>Friends is one of the most uplifting TV series you could watch! There's always something on every episode thats funny or entertaining, even if its not your kinda thing.<br/><br/>Tts the series you can relate to because we all do stupid things, and in Friends it shows you just how over-the-top these little things can get.<br/><br/>If you get the chance to watch it, TAKE IT! I haven't met a person who hasn't seen at least one friends episode! <br/><br/>Bring on more Friends!!! A lot of people agrees with me on this one, friends is one, if not the, best sitcom ever. But can you believe for whole ten seasons it only won 1 golden globe for best actress (Jennifer Anniston), and for the Emmy's it only won for best actress and supporting actress (Jennifer Anniston, Lisa Kudrow) and comedy series once! I believe it was really snubbed by the academy, i mean Matt LeBlanc and Mathew Perry really deserved at least an Emmy more than Lisa Kudrow did. Frasier, Seinfeld, will and grace, were all up against them for the award, but please friends is much better than will and grace and Seinfeld, and is as good as Frasier. David Schwimmer should easily had won best supporting actor, so should Mathew Perry and Matt LeBlanc. I will start to say that this is my favorite show ever, ever, ever and ever. Its not just the funniest comedy-show, its the best of all TV programs thats on TV. Its hilarious but so much more than that to. The humor is just incredible and i love almost every joke thats ever been told in the series. All of the characters and I really mean ALL of them are funny, everyone in there own wonderful way. Of course I have some that I like more but even that is really hard to choose. Because if you have gotten to a point where you think: "Well he is really my favorite", and then if you think of some other character again, you will have to change your mind. Because it doesn't matter how you think, every character will still be as funny as the others. And as I said before, Friends is not just about comedy, its so much more. The way the characters say there lines, their style, the atmosphere and joy makes this show to more than just an ordinary sitcom. I don't even think about it as a show, because the characters are so alive, you are watching a bunch of wonderful people live through 10 years of their lives. You really care about them and feel sorry if something bad happens or really feel the great, funny atmosphere around them when their having fun. The actors are just great to. The producers could not have picked better actors. I must say that this show is just perfect, for you who have not watched, do that. Because if you are a sitcom fan, or a drama fan or just likes a little comedy ones in a while(who does not) you are going to love this. I give Friends 10/10. If you wanna find any better show, start to search now because its going to take you forever. Friends, My favorite show i have seen all the series about million times, i still cry over the 4 last shows, and laugh of all the jokes, i still love every twist, i love the London trip, i love the fact that they didn't cover up Lisa Kudrows(phoebe's) pregnancy but instead they put a osom story line full of humor and what we all love i carrying my brothers baby, that line still cracks me up, i love all about the show maybe I'm addicted or something but it's the only TV show or movie that i have ever gotten this attached, why is that? it's because of the incredible writing how they give comedy a whole new name, but i wanna talk about 2 of the characters / actors,<br/><br/>Chandler Bing . Chandler just cracks me up, he was just pure genius, how can writers find this stuff up? he is just so funny, he is with out a doubt my favorite male character, now something about Chandler he's was Ross friend from college that is his connection to the group, Monica's teen crush, but Chandler also said she was fat and that resulted into Chandler losing his toe, later he Hooke's up with Monica and the get married and have adopted twins, but we all know that don't we?. he is one of the 7 links what make friends "friends". and your probably wondering why i said seven thats because of Gunther i just love that guy. Matthew Perry. ill make this short, he's a funny dude has had his up and downs, drugs and problems, but i really like him as an actor. Ross Geller . He has this kind of silly and i like it :') . he is an "pailiantolabla-bla" i have no idea what his jobs name is but as joey says your work is dinosaurs. but as we all say we miss friends but its over and we love them F- Funny R- Rare I- Intelligent E- Extremely Entertaining N- No Not normal fun. Hysterical fun D- Droll on your floor by laughter S- Seriously, funniest ever <br/><br/>One of the finest series ever. <br/><br/>Actors are exceptional, and so is the writing. <br/><br/>Allow six friends to rock your world with their life, friendship, love, happiness, sadness, and laughter. Believe me, You won't regret it for a second. Although I must warn you it is highly infectious. <br/><br/>They'll be there for you when you need a good laugh. <br/><br/>100 out of 10. Arguing on which show is the best I would always say Friends. Seinfeld, Sex and the City, and Scrubs are very well made shows but still are nothing in comparison to Friends. Every thing they depict in the series is relatable to everyone. It does more than entertain, it shows us scenarios that we go through everday, and helps us get by. With its amazing writing and fast pace, not once do we ever get bored.<br/><br/>The cast of Friends is amazing. Each character brings something unique to the story. They all manage to make you feel for the character and hope they make it through the problems we all go through and see ourselves in. With great performances everyone of the cast shines and no character is flat.<br/><br/>With clean dialouge, everyday matters, and lovable characters this show manages to reach to all its audiences and i highly recommend it to anyone still wanting to enjoy a great sitcom. I don't normally comment on movies or anything, but I just had a FRIENDS night, where I just watched pretty much the whole 4th season and had to watch the last episode of season 10 in which Ross and Rach finally get back together. I mean, forget Romeo and Juliet, Tarzan and Jane, Rambo and his gun. This is the real thing. There's never ever been a couple more made for each other (on TV) than those two. I started watching FRIENDSin 1994, and was a fan right from the beginning. I was 7 by then, so I can say I grew up with the guys and it really kind of tore my heart out when it ended 4 years ago. I watched it with my girlfriend who is not really that into the series and could thus not really understand the fuss I was making about the final (well, she tried, though). Anyway, I couldn't believe that it had to end. I had so much fun with all of them. I mean, laughing about Chandler's genius comments and jokes, about Joeys stupidity, Phobee's naivety, Ross's way of being (and the dinosaurs!!), Monica's mania for cleanliness and Rachel's beauty and...way of being, too. They're unique, witty, and hilarious, the chemistry is perfect between all of them. It's just incomparable. It's just been the most amazing show there ever was. There's never gonna be anything like this. And I am really sorry for that. Well, I'd like to thank Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Courtney Cox-Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer for just being the best FRIENDS, Thanks. You rock!! Well, thanks! One of the best sitcoms out there...and my #1 favorite! People, we need more from our "Friends". I would love to watch a sitcom with Rachel and Ross married, with Emma (she should be around 6 or 7 by now, right?), maybe another kid or baby, Chandler and Monica visiting with the twins, Joey coming on weekend for food, Phoebe and Mike (oh, yes, and their daughter, "Sunshine" (or some other hippie name) dropping by.....come on!! please!!! I have seen the re-runs over and over and over....I already know even the lines! Do not get me wrong, I love them, but it would be more than great to get a come back, in new situations, but with the same people. I can help you to write the sketch if you want! :) but please, do it!!! We really miss them. Best regards! I am 17 years old. I started watching this with my mom when I was six, before I even understood it. I just watched it to spend time with her. As the years went on i understood it more and loved it more. I watched the last three seasons on prime-time and was so sad when it ended. Around 2002, I got my best friend into the show and we watched them in order on DVD from season one, all the way to season 10. Let me just say, this show never got old, the story's were great, the show was hilarious, the cast worked so great off each other, the acting was outstanding, and the ending was perfect!!!!! The was amazing from beginning to end and I still own all 10 seasons and watch them all the time. I was sad for Matt Leblanc to see "Joey" not work out but it never could have been as great as Friends was!!!! Friends is just so funny and cool. It is really the best TV comedy show ever! It has everything a good TV show should has. A perfect storyline, perfect location and of course the whole cast! The characters, writers, producer all did they a great job...no they did a brilliant job! There is not one only episode you could hate! They are all funny and the cast is so good that you really love every episode even it's maybe a little bit boring but there are just about 3 episodes of all you could say they are maybe not as interesting as the others. The location is mostly the purple apartment of Monica and Rachel. There the friends sit and talk. But they are often in the cafÃ© on their street, the 'Central Perk'. But now, let me talk about the most brilliant cast in TV history:<br/><br/>Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston):Rachel was a spoiled rich girl before she came in the pilot into the 'Central Perk'. She left her almost husband at the altar and lived on her father's money until Monica cut her credit carts. Rachel gets a job as a waitress in 'Central Perk' but she is very bad but after a while she takes a job in a fashion store, something she really likes. <br/><br/>Monica Geller (Courteney Cox Arquette):Monica is the cleaning friend. Everything has to be perfect. The apartment's always clean, just everything! She's the sister of Ross. Monica works in a restaurant what she always wanted to be. In her youth she was really fat but no as an adult she's very slender. Later she marries Chandler her brother's college friend.<br/><br/>Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow):Phoebe is the crazy one! She's the one who fights for animal rights, she's also a vegetarian. But what makes her really crazy is her story. She was married to a gay skater, her mother killed herself and as a teenager she lived on the street. But the craziest thing is that she gets the babies of his younger brother Frank. She believes in many things(i.e.she thinks that her mom comes back to her in a cat...)what makes her weird. She works as a masseuse. I just think that Phoebe is the coolest because she is so crazy what makes her the funniest female character.<br/><br/>Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc):Well, you could say that Joey is the dumb one. He tries to be an actor but he doesn't really get good roles so that he has just very little money. But the women love him. Almost every week he's another woman in his bed. He lives in the apartment of Chandler, his best friend, right across the floor, in front of Monica and Rachel's apartment.<br/><br/>Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry):The sarcastic one! The funniest one! The kind of loser. He's just the coolest because he's funny. He works in a firm but none of his friends does really know what he does. He lives together with his friend Joey. But he's the total different to Joey. He hasn't many women. But his advantage is that at the end of season 7 he marries Monica who's the love of his life. To my opinion Chandler is the best one, because he's funny and just cool.<br/><br/>Ross Geller (David Schwimmer):Ross is the smartest, but he has the problem that he always has to be right. He works in a museum has two children and is a three times divorced guy. His first marriage didn't work because his wife became a lesbian. The second one didn't work because at the altar Ross said the name of the wrong woman and the third one was a Vegas marriage, so you know what happens don't you? His big love is Rachel. After a while they are together but Ross' jealousy breaks everything. Then they are back together but then they break up again. It's like driving a roller-coaster. But maybe this is the miracle that makes "Friends" one of the most successful series ever in the American TV history.<br/><br/>You see there are many different things, some very crazy but because of that very funny things. So you should definitely watch it. It's no waste of time! In no way! Just try it! You'll like it. I remember the first time I saw the show and it catch me immediately. It just had this X-factor which a lot of other comedy series don't manage as well as "Friends": The ability to make the viewer laugh every single minute. Even though it seems hard for new upcoming directors and writers to find this X-factor while writing their own comedy, then just take a look at "Friends" and learn. David Crane and Martha Kauffman makes it look so easy. The fact that you can make entering a door fun or a curtain way to talk hilarious then you have something that catches people, including myself.<br/><br/>I've missed the show terribly but after 10 seasons it was the right decision to stop while being on top. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey and Ross will always be missed but never forgotten and they are as well as the writers and directors on this fantastic sitcom - Simply the BEST!!! Imagine yourself growing up and the only thing that u wanna watch in the TV, is not cartoons, or movies, but one of the best serial show ever: Friends. And while you watching you think and say: " God i wish i had friends like that, that we can make jokes, we can trust each other, we can talk with each other and share our problems, we can laugh and cry with each other". This would be a fantastic thing or not? Today is almost impossible to find that kind of friends that they make you feel great and feel free and for me "Friends" it's not just a show only to laugh but it's a show that we can cry too and makes us thing how we can love, respect and stand by each other side (like Phoebe did with Ross in the final episode)so we can be able to create a perfect friendship. It may seem as an impossible thing to create but tell me, what's impossible today? :) I must say that this is the most absolute, great, fantastic and perfect show ever... Friends is the greatest show ever I own some of the seasons and so do all of my girls!! I've loved it ever since I was little and every time I felt or feel bad I just watch it to cheer me up!! This show is great it's real life material yet it's also really great. I think that on the local broadcast listing that the station (wgn/cw) should change it from two and a half men to friends because I truly believe that Friends should be on the air during the day for the local broadcast listings. I really believe that friends rules!!! I think it's great because it's really real yet it's also really funny. It's two in one. It's a great show that should really be on air. Everyone should watch it.If I was allowed to then I would rate it over and over again as all ten's for excellent. This is a great show and everyone should watch and then rate it a ten. Go Friends! 6 friends in USA having conversations and laughing. i think friends is a funny suitable series. it would be an absolute crime not to see it. i was very upset when it ended and i thought friends is always happy and its a comedy you can never get sick of. i've watched each series like 800 times. trust me, i know it sounds lame but when you see it you'll regret not wanting to see it, you will be laughing non-stop. believe it or not once you collect all the friends collection i believe you will have a special gift. i call it the friends gift. if you are not good at friendship friends is also good for advice. watch it, you'll love it. you are at this moment like "yeah right". but when you'll see it you won't be able to speak because your laughing so much and you want to watch it again and again. its the comedy no-one unless their mad will get sick of. i swear that you'll love it! How often does a TV series last 10 years, 10 seasons? How often does a TV series keep our imagination and attention held captive? Not many can fill the shoes that friends walked in. Friends was simply an amazing show.<br/><br/>The characters just mixed perfectly together. They all seemed to aimlessly blend into each other. Without one, the other could simply not survive.<br/><br/>I grew up watching friends, it was apart of my teenage years. I think in years to come, it will be remembered as one of the all time greats. I can still watch repeat episodes and continue to laugh at the same jokes, over and over again. It's with that, you know you have something truly special.<br/><br/>Nothing I've ever watched came close to the brilliance that is "Friends". I don't think anything ever will. I'm just happy I was alive to see it develop and grow up and mature alongside the characters of the show.<br/><br/>Thank you for producing friends. Thank you very much. Friends is quite possibly the funniest and best written sit com of the modern era.this show is fantastic.great characters,great dialogue,hysterical comedy.i actually wasn't into Friends for the longest time.then,i saw an episode on TV and was hooked.i have since bought all ten seasons on DVD.besides just being funny,the show has an edge to it.sometimes it is even racy,but subtly so,because on occasion the characters would say or do something that made me think,hmmm,the censors must have missed that one.the show revolves around the lives of six twenty somethings living in New York City Their favorite hang out is a coffee shop called Central Perk(a great play on words)each of the friends has their own different personalities and quirks,which all mesh together perfectly.the show rarely delved into any serious drama,but it didn't need to.It's strength is clearly comedy.creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane hit gold with this series.Kauffman also wrote a majority of the episodes and Crane wrote a number as well.the show remained consistently high quality throughout its 10 year run,and the last season was more serious than the previous.if you want a show which will have you p---ing your pants and bawling with laughter,this is your show. When you watch one episode you may find them weird. At the second one you'll be sure to laugh more than once. Then you start to like them. You get to like their jokes better and better. Than you watch a couple more episodes and you can't tell when you started to love them.<br/><br/>All six characters are very characteristic and just as imperfect. But guess what - they don't care about their faults, which they can't change. They stay themselves and love one another the way they are. That's the reason why they always lift up your spirit when you watch them. You can identify yourself with some of their features and learn to accept and like yourself. And above all, the humor is so brilliant, well timed, just the greatest portion of laughter you can serve yourself for 22 minutes. In fact the greatest anomaly of 'Friends' is that they repeatedly make jokes on some topic, (like Ross's hair or Monica's obsession about order) and each time you'll find these jokes more fun.<br/><br/>If you don't know 'Friends' yet, surely you don't know what you're missing, and if you do know them it's worth to remember them better by watching all seasons again! Friends became such a big part of my life, that i'm so glad i bought the entire collection on DVD, otherwise i'd be lost without it.<br/><br/>Although as a non-American i can't exactly relate to the characters, there basic misfortunes are similar to life here in Britain and that's how i can relate to them. The balance and chemistry between the 6 of them works and it just ensured the show will go down in comedy history.<br/><br/>The different characters help the show:<br/><br/>Chandler: Funniest guy ever, totally sarcastic too! Monica: Completely neurotic and cleaning-freak Ross: Responsible and at times a little mental Rachel: Not too bright, originally spoilt, but building to success Joey: Dumb as a dodo, but very funny Phoebe: Very kooky, but hilarious<br/><br/>I give this show 10 out of 10, if not for originality, but for genuine warmth and belly-aching laughter.<br/><br/>Long live Friends!!! This show is the best show ever. You could never get a better show. Every single episode you will get a very good laugh. You will never get annoyed with this show no matter how many times you watch it. It is the best show ever. Rachael (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled one who runs out on her wedding day in the first episode, Monica (Courteney Cox)is the chef who doesn't like her mum very much because she is always criticizing everything Monica does, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) is the one that has come off the streets and is a masseuse, Ross (David Schwimmer) is Monica's brother and he is the favorite that his parents like his parents say he was a "medical marvel" and he is a paleontologist, Chandler (Matthew Perry) is the sarcastic one who makes a lot of jokes, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) is the one who is an actor and who is the one who gets all of the girls. Friends is the best show ever and you could not find a better show I've seen each of the episodes of Friends roughly ten times, more or less. And, no matter how many times I see it, I laugh like the first time I saw it. The characters are likable (sometimes with the exception of Monica, but I think that was partly deliberate), their relationships are sweet and realistic (barring some unlikely pairings) and the plots are funny and adorable. If I had one complaint about Friends, it would be that the last two seasons were a little old and the plots seems slightly aged, but even then, they make you laugh out loud non-stop. Their are criticisms of the show, a common one being that it would be impossible for the friends to live in amazing penthouse apartments such as numbers 19 and 20. But, if they actually watched what they were complaining about, they will know that Mon's apartment was actually her Grandma's and that, as Chandler said "it was a frigging steal!" So I would recommend actually watching the material before they complained so much. Chandler Muriel Bing. He stole the show for me. Every line was delivered with wit and precision (the timing of the delivery of his lines was what I would call perfection). Everything that Perry said was witty, funny and charming. Every single character was portrayed as a real person (possibly with the exception of Phoebe, who was seen as a little outer-worldly!), with a big heart, and an even bigger personality. It's impossible not to love them.<br/><br/>Whoever describes Friends as base humour, or 'yuppie' comedy, they need to take it less seriously. Friends was never created to be the thinking man's comedy. It's a lighthearted, fun show for all ages. It does exactly what it says on the can. It gives you six friends, who you grow to live, laugh and love with. F.R.I.E.N.D.S totally rock. I love them; they make you laugh every time, even when you've already seen that episode. It's just awesome,how close can you become to people you don't even know because of the quality of the series and the actors performance; you feel like they are your friends for real. I love those guys....They're unbelievable. I love chandler and his jokes, and I was so happy when he and Monica fell in love, it was so cute. I also love the central perk, it's so cool and cozy, although I've never been there...I think each one of them are really wonderful people, Jennifer Aniston rocks in real life; the other ones just create the best character that t.v has ever seen. I love friends! Its pretty much the only sitcom I can watch over and over and over again without getting sick of it. The casting of the characters is perfect, even though most of them were not the director's first choice. I have easily memorised every episode, and many of my friends have to. And whether it is watched avidly, or as background noise, every episode is every bit as funny as the first time you watch it. Some people don't get Friends, and I can see why. The comedy is very American, with references a lot of Europeans miss, however after watching a few episodes, you get used to it. I am so sad that they wont be making any more episodes. (except for talks about one more, come back special) but I'm glad it went out on a high and tied up most of the loose ends that needed to be tied. There are many continuity errors in the show, but that is normal for such a long running sitcom, and plus its actually fun trying to spot them. Friends is amazing! I would say that "Friends" is really a "must see". It is really a great and hilarious show, and you never tire watching it! <br/><br/>The characters and their development, the humor, the plot - everything leaves nice impression. <br/><br/>Unpredictable changes in the plot sometimes really shock, sometimes make you smile. :) This show is kind, funny, realistic and it shows: "Life IS good, whatever happens!" :) <br/><br/>The actors' play is great. Every character in the show has his own unique and unforgettable personality. And the situations are sometimes just ridiculous, that can make you want to laugh or to cry. :)<br/><br/>So, every episode of the show is REALLY worth watching! You won't stop laughing and waiting for every new episode! ;) Over 230 episodes, of which none were a disappointment, 6 friends, intertwine into one elaborate life, consisting of humour passion and sadness. For the ten year friends aired every episode was as impressive as the next. From 1994 to 2004, the show followed the happenings and changes of contemporary society which allowed the audience to relate to the characters for the full 10 years, which helped expand the shows huge success. Friends is loved by the majority of all the media's target audiences and even now the show is over it is still as popular as ever. The rumours of reunion shows have been said to have only been rumours, but i say bring friends back!!!! hi,i watched ''FRIENDS'' when i was younger,i remember how i liked them!even then i think that show is great!And now after ~8 years I also think in that way.Everybody in this show acted just brilliant.Monika with her obsession to clean,Chandler with his jokes,Ross with his dinosaurs stuff ,Phoebe with her difference,Joey with his ''How you doing?,and finally Rachel with her fashion.''The most I liked relationships between them all.I just like many other fans of ''Friends'' watched every series and hoped that Ross gonna be with Rachel together.When I watched last series of ''Friends'' I really understood that I will miss this show!I will miss those jokes,those faces,smiles,all what they did! that was an excellent TV show! 10/10 my vote for show! Should be more episodes,not enough! I think they should go on like joey did so after a year of being at deferent places they would understand that they should be together and keep going with more adventures and wild situations. I know is hard to do this after 10 years, but if you consider that there are people like me that are watching the show for the third or fourth time you can be sure of the success. Ask for ideas from the fans of the series by mail, and make a summary in order to help you up with the creation of the story,that would help a bit although i am sure that you don't need it as you have done an excellent job,but i am sure it could be a motivation to be occupied with for the fans of FRIENDS.<br/><br/>john The best ever! Ross and Rachel forever!!!! Aniston plays very well and Schwimmer is so cool actor that i even can't describe! So fantastic to see my two favorite actors together! I'm lucky to see them! Thanks God that i see this wonderful film! Thanks! Thanks to IMDb.com for providing such a good and spotless information! I'm from Russia, and i'm rather glad to see information about our films and our actors! Thanks to all for such a brilliant site, and the best film in the world Friends!!!!I also want to say that Matt Le Blanc was opened as a great artist in this film... i don't know him well, but after "Friends" i know that he's so fantastic, charming, he can do everything, he's funny, serious, insane and handsome lover... Wonderful character! Every now and then we like to sit on our couch, have a Snack, and watch invest in the lives of everyones favorite "Friends", Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbianni, Chandler Bing, and Ross Geller. The best "Friends" anyone could ask for. Although there are over 200 episodes of our "Friends", and you may have seen each and every episode once or twice before, it doesn't matter. Every time you watch and episode of "Friends" it feels like you've never watched it before. The comedy is never clichÃ©'e, all the jokes from seasons 1 through 10, are still hilarious and funny, even the episodes that made you cry like "The one with the Proposal" still touch that special place in your heart. Thanks to "Bright, Kaufman, Crane", "Friends" is still as popular as ever. No matter what the episode is you are always guaranteed an good laugh. Like in the theme song "I'll be there for You" our friends will always be there for us, and we'll be there for them too. it's basically understandable and welcomed even in china mainland, by those who are not good in English and live in a totally different background, mainly wade through the lines and dialogues by Chinese captions (unfortunately, most likely it's translated by some idiots from hong kong, full of stupid mistakes, like translate "massage" as "message", or "straight" (sex) as "something not bent", probably make Chinese who totally depend on the caption be confused with American humor).<br/><br/>what i want to emphasize is, even if with so many obstacles, it makes Chinese laugh! my favorite is chandler, i wonder how can he figure out those witty jokes always immediately, you know, those are not meaningless trashes but always to the point and avoid awkward or stressful atmospheres. CHANDLER IS THE KEY OF THIS COMEDY. other four people except monica perform very well too.<br/><br/>my only disappointment is monica, she's old and appearencely not suitable for playing ross's once fat younger sister and chandler's wife (the two actors are respectively two and three of her junior). more importantly, i don't think her performance is funny at all, especially when she was teased in restaurant kitchen by hostile kitchen staff, and she toasted at her parents' anniversary, i felt sorry for her but not funny. her action is formulaized: yell at people while twist her body and arms, staring with blank eyes, that can fit any lines, or maybe none. like joey's Australian girlfriend in one episode said: she's loud for such a small person, and i think she's annoying too. "Friends" is definitely THE best television show to have ever aired. The twists and turns of these six friends, filled with laughter and romance is incomparable to any other sitcom of its time. Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Phoebe and Chandler - six names that no one will be able to think of the same again since this show. Ross, the dorky guy next door, who you can't just help but want to love. Rachel, the beautiful high school cheerleader with a gorgeous smile and looks to die for. Monica, the uptight beauty that many teenage girls can relate to. Joey, your typical slow, yet gorgeous male friend. Phoebe, the out there friend that you could talk to forever. And Chandler, the funny man who has the the sweetest personality and smile. If you have not seen "Friends," then turn on the television and watch the reruns. One episode will make you fall in love forever. Your life will be changed after watching this show. Your life is incomplete without it. Friends is a juggernaut of a television show. A king of the comedy world. An award winning sitcom that also won millions of hearts during its lifespan.<br/><br/>It portrays the lives and loves of six inseparable friends, three guys and three girls. Starting in 1994 and ending no less than a decade after, the show saw its core characters go from strength to strength. Personally, i think the roots of the shows massive success are the writing, and the six main actors themselves. The relationships between the characters grow and develop over long periods of time, so effective and endearing is the writing here that it's almost like: "Hey there are some actual people stuck in this television set, oh my god get them out!"<br/><br/>Don't believe me? Friends was and is so popular that in its first two seasons it boasted celebrity guests such as George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Ben Stiller etc.. as well as Brad Pitt and Danny Devito in its last season. It really does hit the spot every time. Basically if you like having friends, then you will love this show. If you don't, then you will probably still love this show.. <br/><br/>Peace and go watch Friends! :) I can successfully say that I have seen every episode of Friends. Starting with season one in Central Perk to the end of season ten in Monica's apartment.. This show is amazing!<br/><br/>When watching it, one cannot help but feel like they are one of the "Friends." I was so disappointed when Friends ended, but it's always nice to watch the re-runs. I collect the DVD's and have the game. This show is the absolute best show ever!<br/><br/>I can be in the most terrible mood, and after 30 seconds of Friends, I can set aside my problems and just hysterically laugh! It's a great relief knowing that my "Friends" are there for me. <br/><br/>I definitely am a Friends FANATIC! I think that this is a great show/movie! i think that it is one of the best ones ever! in fact i am watching it right now! I think it would be great for all of you! This show is on t.v. on my different channels! Like 10 on some Fridays and many Many More! It is really funny and it gives you memories to remember it by! So give it a try and your live will be the best!YOU GOT IT , It is my favorite show/movie! Have a great day! ... .... ......... .. ....... ..... ... ... . .... ... . .. ... . .. .. .... ...... ..... ..Have a great day and remember that this is the show for you!... ..... ....... .............. ............ .... ..... ........ ...... ...... .. .......... ... ....... ... .. . ...Sweet dude!... ... . . . ... ........ . ... ...... ........ .. . ... .. ... ... ..... ...... ..... . .... . .... ..... ..... . .... .. .... .. .. ... . ..... ...... ... . . Friends tells the story of a group of 6 people who are tied together by the force of friendship. Through their 10 year journey, they have filled our hearts with laughter, joy and sometimes even sadness. Even in some cultures where living separately from one's family is very uncommon, Friends has shown that it is not as hard as it sounds, and has even made me want to move out and live with my friends. The great storyline and the way everything just 'fits' it the best part of Friends. In some way at least one of the characters resembles you. The 6 goofy coffee house people live their life in the funniest manner, giving us faith and courage about living life single, and at the same time making us laugh. The sweetness of Rachael, motherness of Monica, crazy, hippy Phoebe, the sarcastic jokes of Chandler, the slow brain of Joey and geeky Ross, all make us understand the importance of friendship. This is truly a great show which has filled years of my life with laughter. And, if the ending episode didn't have such a heavy emotional effect on my heart, I would gladly watch it with my friends around! This show is fantastic. Every single episode is hilarious. How can it not be? The script is well done and the characters work well together. There is a certain chemistry about that group, even though all of their personalities are totally different. Chandler is sarcastic and is always making a witty comment. He is my favorite out of the group. Then you have Monica, a neat freak who has a big competitive drive. Her brother Ross, a dinosaur loving man, has many funny moments, the actor does a great job of portraying the geek and all his charms. Then there is Rachel, her personality is that of a shopping addict, her personality was once more complex but after achieving her individuality she didn't have as many layers. But she does give us some laughs as, with her wants such as the time in the seventh season when she fell for her secretary. And Phoebe, with her crazy idea's and schemes always makes a funny comment. But I think that the most liked character would be Joey, with his perverted nature, stupidity and most of all the he caring of his friends.<br/><br/>I love this show and have no complaints. I give it 10/10. Friends has been one of the truly greatest TV programs of all time, its witty characters, and unmatched storyline, which often is missed in most sitcoms, where the story lines are often discarded. and from time to time very good guests on the show such as, George clooney, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Reese Witherspoon to name a few.<br/><br/>Each Character, Joe, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Pheobe and Ross are such great characters that you can really relate to in some situations.<br/><br/>and in my personal opinion Chandler being the best character in it, with some of the best lines in TV history.<br/><br/>a definite 1000/10 The loves and lives of 6 people in NY. Throughout 10 seasons you will follow these people through fortune and losses, and soon they will become like a family away from your own! With this show, you need no real friends! Joke aside, the show is amazing! I can watch it, hours on end without getting bored! We have Joey, the actor, who is the adorable yet chauvinistic type in the show. Hardly prized for his intellect.<br/><br/>Then there is Chandler, the one with the wit. Always funny, and has one of the weirdest families around.<br/><br/>Not to be forgotten is our paleontologist (I reserve myself for any misspellings) Ross, who has his humouristic sides, as well as his overly adult ones.<br/><br/>According to me, the beauty of the bunch is Rachel. The used-to-be-a-spoiled-brat-who-lived-on-daddy's-credit card struggles to find her niche, and the sub-plot together with Ross is the most immense.<br/><br/>The neat-freak Monica doesn't tolerate any filth or disorder anywhere. She has a loving, yet fightful relationship with her brother Ross.<br/><br/>And last, but hardly least, there's Phoebe! The nut-job of the bunch. Totally relies on her highly developed intuition, and also has a very tragic/comic history.<br/><br/>Do not miss out! Friends was and still is an incredible television show. The writing done was absolutely brilliant, with every episode having something to make it memorable. The actors and actresses had wonderful delivery, and the chemistry between the six is fantastic. The main characters include Monica, an obsessive neat freak, who is sister to Ross, a paleontologist that is still a geek on the inside. Ross was college roommates with Chandler, the sarcastic one with never-ending girl problems. Rachel is the spoiled girl who you simply have to love, Joey is a struggling actor who has a weakness for meatball subs, and Phoebe is a massage therapist/guitar player who has her own special point of view on things. I own all 10 seasons on DVD and have seen every episode, and I would like to personally say that this could very well be, and in my opinion most definitely is, the greatest television show of all time; may it go on forever in syndication. I have seen F.R.I.E.N.D.S so many times , first from the beginning till the end and then every time i feel watching it , between other daily activities and i can just say : IT IS UNIQUE ! The best T.V show ever made , with all the things which made it impossible to compete . Writing & Directing are great and also all the actors really fit their place . Although it may seem strange but i know there are negative votes on Friends and with all the respect , i think humor is something which cannot be learned or thought , so there will always be such people who think that making jokes or bringing laughter to other people's life is a " cheap way of entertaining " .<br/><br/>Anyhow , i myself love the show and i think almost everything is perfect , but it seems that Guys cast & crew is much more better than Gals . ( My personal idea : David Schwimmer ROCKS ! ) Don't miss the series pals , and enjoy every second .<br/><br/>Regards - Shahab This is my favorite TV show ever! I have seasons 1-3 and want to get the rest, but being 13 makes me a little short for cash. I love all of the people.<br/><br/>Ross-strange but lovable. smart and a little off. he is the smart one who was rejected as a kid.<br/><br/>Rachel- the popular girl who was pretty oblivious to everything. She almost got married but realized it was a B A D idea. Gunther loves her.<br/><br/>Monica-Ross's sister. In high school she was H U G E. She becomes a clean freak and a cook. she has some troubles but she knows what she wants and won't give it up.<br/><br/>Chandler-The funny, girl less man. He has many troubles with things like women, thanksgiving, and girls. He has this weird thing that when he talks he says it with a big space. He also for a while had a 3rd nipple.<br/><br/>Joey-He is all about the women. He is stupid, but charming. He can't speak French for the life of himself. J'm'app-ell(sorry about spelling) Claude. Blah blah blah blah Claude.<br/><br/>Pheobe-She is most likely the weirdest. Her mother killed herself so Phoebe lived on her own(she has a twin sister that hates her) She was a punk but different. She will clean your Ora if you're down. friends is such an amazing series it started when i was only a baby but oh my god it has always been a program i have watched and will talk about and laugh till it hurts about. i will definitely recommend it to every one which i do most of the time anyway, the writers and the cast add something that no other program has they have such a unique quality and if you have not watched it i advise that you do because you missing out on something so incredible. i just cant believe it has finished i was so upset and it is so hard to watch the last episode because i no there is no more after it. i would give it 10 out of 10 every time and 6 stars its better than 5 stars. I just cannot believe that these group of six hilarious actors have left this remarkable show. I am so proud that they have lasted for 10 wonderful years on television. Friends has been my most favourite TV show and I gotta tell you that I have taped every episode, have collected articles about them and even getting the DVD's now. I know I am a FRIENDS FANATIC! I just love them all. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross are all great characters and these bright actors have made them into real people. Such hilarious episodes have always taken me back for more viewing, I have loved every one of them and I will never get tired of them. To Jennifer, Courteney, Lisa, Matt, Matthew and David, I want to say that thank you for these fabulous ten years of laughter and sadness. This show of yours has been one heck of a lifetime for you guys and it has showed me that characters like these only come once in a lifetime. <br/><br/>F.R.I.E.N.D.S. FOREVER!!! 1994 - 2004 FRIENDS...<br/><br/>Some of my friends were always telling me to watch FRIENDS... but I refused every time... till the day I sat in front of my TV and gave it a chance. I can't describe how pleased I was! I have watched from the first season to the sixth and now I'm waiting for the realese of the seasons remaining...<br/><br/>It's just too good to see these friends get together... All that jokes and funny situations get lots of laughs from me (sometimes I also drop a tear).<br/><br/>I think Chandler and Monica are the best characters. I like them so much... Maybe it is because I have some of Monica's crazies... and sometimes I make fun of my friends, just like Chandler does. I don't know...<br/><br/>What I know for sure is that FRIENDS is great TV show, not because it discusses all the big questions of Humanity, such as "Where I came from?" or "What is meaning of life?". It is great because it doesn't matter what is going on in your life: all you need to get your heart light is to watch these funny friends for a couple of minutes...<br/><br/>Yes... you will always be able to find out some of your friends characteristics among those portrayed by Chandler, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel and Ross.<br/><br/>The actors are so good that the character they play will always be remembered. It is impossible to Jennifer Aniston without thinking of Rachel... and the same to the others...<br/><br/>I can't wait the next season come to the store... And I already have that strange feeling that you have when you know something you like is about to end...<br/><br/>I know ten years is a lot of time... but... it doesn't matter how long you stay with your best friend (or FRIENDS)... if you know he is leaving it seems that your heart is being broken.<br/><br/>Yea... these six FRIENDS will always be among the best memories I'll have.<br/><br/>Hope to hear from you around the world that also like FRIENDS... Friends is an amazing show. It is the best show I have ever seen and it's definitely my favorite show ever! They picked brilliant actors to play the parts and I love all of them. What's so great about friends is you feel like you know them. You feel like they are YOUR friends and you can relate to them on so many levels. Whenever I feel sad I just put in a video of friends and laugh my way out of the blues. I have seen most episodes 4 or 5 times and the episodes on my tapes over 15 but I still laugh at the jokes. Friends make me feel so comfortable...they don't seem just like jokes they seem like inside jokes between me and my friends that I could hear 2000 times and still love it and think it is hilarious. The writing is tremendous and so is the acting. I think many people judge it after the first time of seeing it and think it's stupid. To all of you who did that, give it another chance. Watch 2 or 3 more episodes and you'll love it. From Monica's obsessions to Chandler's sarcasm. From Rachel's gossip to Joey's cluelessness. From Phoebe's ditziness, to Ross's loyalty. It's a great group of people that will make you feel so in, so accepted. They are unbelievable! It's over... The best comedy series rich its end. It is and will be the best because of their actors and actress, for their public, for the excellent writers, and all the crew. Thanks you all, there will not be anything like "friends" in the T.V. history, and I'm proud to being one of the thousands that has watch this show. And when my grandson ask me if i saw that wonderful comedy, I'll tell him, yes, from the begin till the end son... Thank you again! For all the happy moments that you gave to us!! Francisco, in the name of all the fans from Argentina. E-Mail me if you want: paco@mail.gr I think that Friends is great. The story lines are so so so funny, in every episode I laugh and laugh and laugh(especially with Ross). The actors... in my opinion Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, Mathew Perry and David Schwimmer were perfect. I think that best characters were Ross and Rachel, and maybe Joey. The love story between Ross and Rachel was the best ( "We were on a break!!!). I think that (because of the people that watched it)Friends will be like Seinfield, it would be on TV again and again and people would never get tired of it ( at least I don't get tired of watching some episodes, like the one with Brad Pitt and the one in Vegas ). To sum up, FRIENDS is one of the best shows on TV . I think 'Friends' was a great show. The jokes are funny and the actors are good. Of course, not all episodes were great. Some episodes were just too much, or too unbelievable. But mostly it was a good show. I think it's amazing it remained good for 10 years. And all the actors stayed. That shows that they must be friends in real life too, because otherwise, you can't spend 10 years of your life with people you see almost every day. I doubt it if 'Joey' will be such a big success, because it's just more of the same, with less of the actors. It was a good idea to stop 'Friends' while it was still popular, so I don't really understand why they're making a spin-off. But 'Friends' was a great show. At least, it was in my opinion. Six characters that make a delicious cocktail:<br/><br/>Gorgeous Rachel, a self-made business-woman who once was a snobbish rich girl. She always screw something up and her impulsiveness could kill her thousand of times. <br/><br/>Eccentric Phoebe, who wears exotic clothes and does rare things like carrying her brother's babies in her womb and giving them out to him. But her remarks are surprisingly smart and full of common sense.<br/><br/>Brilliant Monica, who devotes all her time to cleaning and cooking and hates people messing around. She longs for husband and kids but she is unlucky with the guys until she meets ...<br/><br/>Hilarious Chandler, who can make joke of anything or anybody. Nobody knows where exactly he works. He is desperate in relationships but one day he falls in love with ... <br/><br/>Fantastic Joey, who had so many girlfriends that cannot remember the names of 90 per cent of them. If you want to date him, you should be aware that Joey does not share food!<br/><br/>Charming Ross, who is highly educated professor and as all very intelligent people often finds himself in awkward situations. His first wife is a lesbian and he was divorced three times.<br/><br/>And they show us what a true friendship really means. They always hang around together, they support each other, share their ideas and beliefs..And a good sense of humor always helps, as Candler says. The stories of their ups and downs, romances and other staff are told with a sharp wit which makes this show one of the best comedy series ever. friends has to be the best TV show in the world, i have seen it from the very beginning to the very end and never once doubted the brilliance of the show! i want to give the writers, directors, actors and actress' a round of applause they don't know how much entertainment they have given to millions of people everywhere.<br/><br/>Friends is about six friends who live in new york! these friends include Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green, David Shwimmer as Ross Gellar, Courtney Cox Arquette as Monica Gellar, Matt le-Blanc as Joey Tribbiani, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing and last but not least Lisa Kudrow as Pheobe Buffay! they all unique in different ways and all give out a different characteristic that different people can relate to! this is why its loved so much!<br/><br/>I am aiming to get every single episode on DVD so far i have series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7! i would recommend friends to anyone who likes a good comedy.<br/><br/>i was so sad when friends ended in may this year! the last episode was fantastic! it was moving, hilarious, upsetting all in one! i cant believe that its over i haven't really got my head round it yet! i must sound really geeky but it is the best sitcom i have ever seen! in fact its the only sitcom i can watch over and over and over again without getting bored and thats unusual for me!<br/><br/>anyone who hasn't seen it must be mad! you should start watching TODAY! you will fall in love with it i swear!<br/><br/>and now i hear Matt Le-Blanc (joey tribbiani) is doing a spin off show called JOEY i will be checking that out though i doubt it will be as good as FRIENDS.

Friends is a great memorable series that came out in one of my favorite years of the 1990's, 1994. The show is about six friends in New York City who are on their own and struggling to survive in the real world, find the companionship, comfort and support they get from each other to be the perfect antidote to the pressures of life. My favorite characters were Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc). I remember on the night of the series finale when I was out having dinner at a restaurant and it was 7:00pm and every one at the restaurant was watching the 2-Hour Series Finale on NBC and I said to myself that I was sure that every one all over the world was watching this! If you like the show so much you can get it on DVD! Plus I also catch some of the repeats on Fox. This has been another great comedy series to remember along with The Simpsons, Just Shoot Me, Dhrama and Greg, Will and Grace, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Drew Carey Show and The King of Queens!<br/><br/>User Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: A GREAT TV-SERIES TO REMEMBER! 10 years has flown by for the friends. They have been fantastic for us fans to watch on tv. Thye have doing fantastic over the 10 years, now after 10 years of living together in a flat, the friends have decided to move on, move on to something else, My favourite female friends character was that woman who played Phoebe, i think she is very funny, my favourite episode with her in it is when she is making her own music video called Smelly Cat and then she finds out that someone else took her place, my favourite Male friends character has got to be Ross because it's the name i have and i'm happy to have my name named after me, Overall i would like to wish all the friends all the best after they all moved out in that big flat they lived in together for 10 years, they have been excellent to watch. I wonder if there will be a Friends Reunion, where they is a one of special, Only Fools and Horses did a couple of spin offs and they were excellent, i hope the friends will, just to catch up what they left off when they left the flat. 10 out of 10. Well goodbye forever friends. To you all still as fans of friends, they character Joey is making his own show called Joey, good eh. "Friends" has ended after ten absolutely GREAT years! I couldn't believe it when the finale aired! Okay... First, I'm really glad that Rachel and Ross got together, I loved the way they got back together. Second, Monica and Chandler finally got, not one, but TWO babies (twins)! So happy for them! And in the end, they wrapped it up in a great fashion with Chandler's sarcastic comment and them all crammed in the hallway, and finally, the look around of the kitchen. The finale almost put me in tears, I mean, one of the best shows in the world was coming off air! It was the end of the world for some of us! However, I am thankful that there will probably be reruns and that the legacy of "Friends", one of the greatest sitcoms, can live on forever! This show is worth a watch and definitely deserves a 10/10 for all those long years of making us laugh! When I was about 9 or 10 I use to love watching "Friends" because it was "Cool" and the women were "Really Fit" (Except for Lisa Kudrow).  But I went back to it ad found it hilarious, a very vivid, honest and refreshing program to watch.  I recommend it (especially for 12-20) year olds. "Friends" has been one of my all-time favorite shows. The writing has always been top notch, with equally top notch acting. The 6 actors lucky enough to be cast in this very funny show have done it well for 10 years. Kudos to Ellie Kanner for the initial casting of these fine comedic actors.<br/><br/>While I have enjoyed all of their performances, I must confess that Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc have been my absolute faves, with Courtney Cox-Arquette being my least favorite. I feel her talents lie not with comedy, per se, but rather within the dramatic realm. If Lisa Kudrow can keep her "Phoebe" character out of other roles (hasn't accomplished this yet), she will have a fine film career.<br/><br/>I must comment, though, that even though I've enjoyed the comedic talents of Aniston, et al and their talented writers and producers, I must not ignore my utter disappointment in the lack of guest-starring minorities in the 10 years it's been on the air. With the notable exceptions of the talented Gabrielle Union and the actress who played Joey-then-Ross' girlfriend in 2003, I was appalled at lack of ethnic minorities depicted on the show. One needs only to walk out onto the sidewalk in NY to witness the cultural diversity. Fans from other countries never having been in Manhattan surely might deduce that it is an all-white territory. I am continually bothered by Hollywood's erroneous depiction of how America is. Why is it that sitcoms always have either an all-white cast or an all-black cast? This is 2004 and people of all races co-mingle and co-exist everywhere. Except maybe in Montana, Utah, and places of similar demographic populations.<br/><br/>A-N-Y-W-A-Y, it's been a great 10 years. After a shaky first few episodes in '94-'95, "Friends" developed into one of the all-time greats. Great writers, producers, and actors all share credit for this enormously funny sitcom. I just hope that writers and producers in 2004 can create equally funny sitcom material that can be applied to another group of equally talented actors that displays diversity.<br/><br/>To the cast/writers/producers of "Friends", your fans bid you adieu! For me, Friends is really funny and I feel sorry for those who can't appreciate it. Although, their not too well developed sense of humour isn't their fault, they should try to educate theirselves. No offense, but maybe finishing a school would help. This is not meant as an insult, I just find Friends truly great. I for one would like to say that I will definitely miss the show.  I love this show a whole bunch.  I have a passion for it.  I have watched every episode and some more than others, and for those reruns I have seen over and over, they bust me up every time.  I wish the show would go on forever but i understand that some of the cast members would like to move on.  I can't wait for Joey's spin off though, that will be excellent.  Maybe some day after a while they will have a reunion show to bring back everyone for one last time.  For now I would like to say, to the cast of FRIENDS you will be greatly be missed by one fan and probably many others.  Good luck with the future. Friends is my favourite sitcom, and being a Brit I do actually prefer American comedy to British. I'll be sad to see it go, its been a great 10 years, maybe a once a generation adventure perhaps, but I'll always watch the DVD's, and pass them along to family and friends for them to enjoy as I am currently doing. Long live friends and good luck for the future. All you need is Friends! This show sets in New York City. And these 6 friends go through everything together, dating, marriage, parenthood. It's one of the best comedies ever! It's really worth watching, and it is way better than Seinfeld. Friends, I think, is the best sitcom on television. I was seven when the series began in 1994, and I've watched ever since, enjoying every second of it. From spoiled Rachel to anal-retentive Monica to New Age ditz Phoebe to womanizer Joey to smart aleck Chandler to geeky Ross, the Friends gang is often touching, sometimes unusual, but always hilarious. Throughout troubles love lives, career difficulties and other problems, the gand has survived it all in a comical way that never fails to brighten one's day. The show will, unfortunately, be ending its run at the end of next season and I'm sorry to see it go. I highly recommend this show to anyone of any age. 100/10 I find this to be a fantastic show that is so full of humor that you just forget all of your worries and get sucked into the lives of these six people albeit, it is farfetched and the situations they find themselves in are not really realistic but it is a comedy after all and a good one at that Lovely, humorous show about six friends living in New York City. When I watch reruns, it is nice to think about how the characters have matured and grown over the years, which is something that almost never happens in a long-running comedy. I didn't like the '02-'03 season finale though. I will be very sad to see this show end in 2004.. I think "Friends" and "The Simpsons" are the best TV shows ever. Every episode has something refreshing and interesting in it. Of all the characters, I like Chandler the most. I just love his sarcasm. The other actors are great too. I know some people think this show is getting worse. If they don't like it, why do they keep watching it? "Friends" is as funny as it has always been, and I hope that I will have the 10 seasons on DVD. A well-deserved 10/10. How to sum op a great comedyseries that's now in it's 9th season? It's nowhere near stretched out, the characters remain fresh, and one can only WISH you had friends like these? There's Chandler M. Bing, the one who makes fun of his 5 friends in this show, yet they all make fun of him, not always appreciated by Mr. Bing himself. Married to Monica Geller, these two are the only married couple inside this friends gang.. There's Rachel Karen Green, a once posh, spoiled rich girl who made it on her own, without help of her dad's creditcard, but with these friends.<br/><br/>Joey Francis Tribbiani, the ladies man, who as an actor wishes to be Al Pacino, instead of being just as good as him. He may not be the smartest of the bunch, but he's always there when you need a little Joey! Ross Geller, the nerdy geeky guy, works something with dinosaurs, had a crush on Rachel like, forever, and now has a child with her. A bit soft, but loyal to his friends, it wouldn't be the same without a little bit Ross.. Monica Geller, the one who's always the host of the gang. Used to be very big when she was young, she and Rachel are the ones who know each other the longest. Obsessive in a funny way, you can tell she's related to Ross :) Last but not least there's Phoebe Buffay, the masseuse who's a bit weird and funky! <br/><br/>These 6 friends share a life together, most of the time in Monica's appartment or at Central Perk, a coffeehouse in New York, and in a funny way we see what's going on in their lives. <br/><br/>Recommended episodes are: Pilot Episode, TOW No One's Ready, TOW The Prom Video, TOW That Could've Been, TOW The Free Porn, TOW All The Thanksgivings, TOW Everyone Finds Out, TOW The Chick And The Duck, TOW Ross Got High.<br/><br/>These are probably some of the best episode of the Friends series, in which you will find every character at his/her best. But heck, almost every episode is great. The series never get boring: from all of my DVD's, these are the ones that are played most often.<br/><br/>My rating: 9 out of 10 I really like this sitcom (if it is a sitcom...it has laughter, and odd people, so it probably is). It's in the same league as Caroline in the City and Home Improvement, with a dash of ER-style-drama to make it all the more fun.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the incidental music is predictable to 5 decimal places. As far as sitcoms go, this is the best. The characters are likeable and they've been around for about the last ten years so we really do feel like we know them by now. The beauty of them is that you can watch them over and over and over and still find them funny. Now they aren't exactly brain-food and they aren't exactly realistic but then it is a sitcom and not panorama and it's main purpose is to entertain and make people laugh and that's what 'Friends' does. I think it is just as funny now as it's ever been... I generally tend to hate shows everyone won't shut up about and the ones that get like a gazillion viewers every week because that just makes you look harder for flaws, but I can't do that with Friends. Yes, as everyone has said, there are flaws, but if you are looking for the flaws then you're missing the point anyways. Do you sit down and watch a sitcom to see what you can complain about in it or do you sit down to watch it and have fun?<br/><br/>
One thing that you do need to get through this thing is a little suspension of disbelief, however. To believe that an actual person can be as ditzy as Phoebe or as stupid as Joey requires some leeway there. Joey would be put in "special" place if he were real and Phoebe...well...let's just say she'd also be a "special" girl. The jokes are often very unrealistic in the fact that no one's life is THAT funny and no one tells jokes every 30 seconds.<br/><br/>
The whole laugh track seems timed, and that is one thing I will comment on about being flawed. I hate the whole system where they babble about something, make a joke, babble, joke, babble, joke...see where I'm going? And no one in the show seems to think anything is funny. Something insanely funny will happen to, let's say, Phoebe, so that you are cracking up and the other people (Ross, Rachel, etc.) are just standing there. Their reactions are all wrong. <br/><br/>In one episode, Rachel let a pillow fall off their apartment balcony and later a man came to their door and handed the pillow to Chandler, who was unaware it had even fallen, and he takes it with a weird look, the laugh track goes crazy, and he turns around and just sets it down, not even bothering to ask his friends in the room "What the hell was that about?" I mean, who would just put it aside and not say "Hey guys, someone just gave me a pillow...". Hello? He just forgets it? Sure. <br/><br/>But all this is not the point, however bad it may seem. It's a fun show with funny situations and the characters are great so the show has endured for years. If only people in real life knew how to kick it back like these people, there'd be no worries. I think everyone could take an example from the characters of Friends. <br/><br/>And by the way, what's with the bad reviews? I mean, the show gets number 1 or 2 every week in the Nielsen's...that MILLIONS and MILLIONS of viewers...obviously just about...gee...90 PERCENT of America thinks it's funny! Who's bad-mouthing, the other 10 percent? Enjoy it, it's a funny show. Friends is a 30 min show about 6 Friends who live in the State of New York. Some are roomates or married. It basically shows their everyday life and events. I know many people say that the plots are irealistic. To begin with they are not THAT irealistic as many people make it seem. First of all it is possible for you and your friends to live in the same city or be roommates it is also possible in real life to get married as did Monica & Chandler or Rachel & Ross. And the past of each character adds a little something but are not impossible nor improbable. Ok! so on the show there not always at work but its showing the times there at home or hanging out. I must say I like Friends. Because it's funny and it gives you a glimpse of what could maybe seem like your future. And I must add if this show sucked this much as many people say then why is it it has aired for around 10 years and won and award? Because it's good. As are the acters each of them have mastered their character which makes it even better!!!!!! i love 'friends', and at first i couldn't work out why but then i realised it's for the most simple of reasons... the show is well scripted, well cast and above all else the writers and actors have been able to create real characters, that you can't help but love. the key to the show's success, i feel comes from the great backgrounds that each character has been given, especially with each other... the underlying history explains so much to us, and gives us the feeling that these people really do know each other and have been friends for years. i just hope that there's a few seasons left for this show, because it would be a real shame to lose such a great comedy series... and even more than that it would be a shame to not be able to watch chandler, joey, pheobe, ross, monica and rachel every week, because they have such a real feel to them, because not only do we know the characters, but we know all about their somewhat comedic lives. i don't think this is like saved by the bell, its just friends which is much better than sbtb. Where has this guy been? Friends is a classic and will continue to be. I can't wait for the next series to start on thursday, i will be watching it every week. So there!!!! The actors and actresses are wonderful, the characters are wonderful, the plots are wonderful. It couldn't get any better. Whoever says that FRIENDS is a bad, horrible, useless TV show... well, let's just say they couldn't be any more wrong. I've been hooked on this show ever since it started, and it only got better from then on. Why else would it have won so many awards, so much praise, and glued so many people's eyes to the TV set on Thursday nights? And this show deserves all of it. Even years from now, FRIENDS will still be loved and well recognized. Almost everybody can relate to the six characters, and the lines are witty and extremely funny. This isn't just an opinion: it's a guarantee. Could this show BE any funnier?  Yeah, it probably could - but is it most deffinitely worth your time.<br/><br/>The one-liners and varied characters always lend a nice flavor to the humor, and while some of their material has gotten old in it's eighth and ninth season, it's grip on the coveted Thursday 8PM slot is far from slipping.<br/><br/>One thing I like is that even though there are story arcs in this series, many of the episodes stand independent of each other.  Plot lines are carried out over several episodes, but it wouldn't be hard for a casual viewer to jump in and out.<br/><br/>'Friends' always delivers great laughs, every week; tune in and you won't regret it. I love this show. I am so glad that this show is going to go towards thier 10th season. There is no words to explain this how but FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!! The characters are great. I think that Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) show win an emmy for thier character. But overrall this show rocks and its funny and hilaruos. You can even watch the re-runs and still laugh like you have never seen this. I won't ever forget this show.! i thnk that is amazing!!! how the writers could make such characters that the world can sink into.  there is so much history, and every episode the plot unravels making you want to watch it more and more!!!! chandler is my favorite character because he is soooooo funny.  i love all the characters, and i hope that there will be a 10th season.  friends is the best show that will ever be created!!!!!! For some reason this base excuse for a sitcom seems to remain on our screens year in, year out. Why is it that audiences can't see past the half-baked scripts and street theatre acting to realise that it is merely a collection of hackneyed g-rated gags performed by an overpublicised cast who are screaming towards 40.<br/><br/>The main supporters of this show are evidently those who list their main asset as an unroadworthy RV and like their Raccoons well done. Perhaps it would be appropriate if Friends was to be relocated to a trailer park somewhere in the mid-West of the US. Only then would we be able to see an episode where the cast become Tornado fodder.<br/><br/>Whenever I am forced to endure an episode, it takes at least a flagon of sour mash for me to get past the first ad break.<br/><br/>Every week it's like being ambushed in a fox-hole by Bob Saget and listening to his lame monologues while the Napalm burns around you.<br/><br/>Come on consumers - demand more from your networks and let this Dolphin get caught in the fishing nets where it belongs. could this show be any better? showing the lives of the now thirty-somethings living in new york, this programme can do no wrong. monica and chandler, now happily married, are ready for a child, as chandler is no longer afraid of comittment. rachel and ross have their own bundle of joy(emma gellar green), but will joey become stepfather? this programme is pure genius. who would have thought a group of mainly forever-singletons, thirty somethings could be so interesting? This show is one of my favorites on TV right now.  It shows the lives of 6 out of college and living on their own friends, through their dating lives and their friendship.  There are few shows that are about people in their twenties, most are of those in their teens.  As watching the show I live in a fantasy world and hope that when I get into my twenties that I'll have friends as close as the characters of this hit tv show, friends that will help me through my hard times such as those on the show.  And I know I speak for many, I will miss this show when it leaves the air, and I hope that they have reunion movies and other movies based on this show such as the shows of the 70's and 80's.  I can't think of life without Friends. ...cause you'll be there for me too.Friends is a comedy show about six singles, Monica (Courtney Cox), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Joey (Matt LeBlank), Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Ross (David Schwimmer).These friends go through some difficulties of life, in a very funny way.Friends will make you laugh.Just a great show.Watch it! This show is certainly funny but it doesn't, as the viewer above indicated, portray my "friends."  I love my friends and I love this show, but these people are TV people.  Fine for fantasy...but it is not a realistic portrayal of life.  I'm not complaining, just responding to a previous comment.<br/><br/>Here are some facts: 1) There is no way an unemployed singer (Phoebe), an unemployed fashion plate/waitress (Rachel) and a chef could live in a multi-bedroom apt. with a fabulous view in NYC.  It would cost $6,000/month! Are you telling me that one person is paying for it all?<br/><br/>2) Across the hall, the rarely employed actor and the statistician are going to foot the rent on that place?  Not.<br/><br/>3) Do you know a lot of people that carry their brother's child?  And that have the same name as their mother?<br/><br/>4) If they are all vaguely employed (some more than others), how do they have time to constantly be sitting around, drinking coffee, listening to Phoebe sing, chilling at the girls' apt., etc.?  People work.<br/><br/>I'm sure I have more, but I have to go do real things now.  Anyway, my point is only that this is NOT a realistic picture of life in a major metropolitan U.S. city.  It costs too much to have that much leisure time.<br/><br/>Realism aside, I like the show, I watch it.  It's great, etc.  I'm not busting the show, just the statement that it, in any way, reflects reality. Poeple,people .. If this became America's #1 show, I think there 's a pretty good reason. The show deserves to be awarded so many emmy's really everyone in the cast deserved to be praised. It's just damn hilarious and if people are criticizing this show they just have to shut up and get a life ! Ofcourse we may think that Ross and Rachel's relationship might me going on and off a little too often but who cares the rest is great and This show totally deserves to be loved whether in Italy or China. I went to Italy last year and saw that on the french channel , friends was on, I just can't get over it, and that even though I don't have time to watch every time it's still god damn funny !! THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!! I have never seen a better show, and have not seen an episode that has disappointed me right from the moment the show aired till the latest episode! Whoever hates this show, doesn't know what they're missing. FRIENDS RULES!!!!! i  use  to be  a huge  fan  of  this  show  but  now   its  lost all  its appeal  its  not   funny  anymore   the  cast  although  great  are  not half  as  good    the  weird  guest  apperances  by  other  movies  stars is maybe  the  worst  part I still can't understand why anyone thinks this show is any good. Granted, I don't like romantic comedies; but somehow I find it hard to believe that anyone could find these people's lives interesting. The first season was good, but it has gone downhill ever since, with more emphasis on ridiculous plotlines and big name guest stars. The show is no "Three's Company", which knew how to mix romantic comedy with pure slapstick and humour. Here, we have nothing but 6 sex-obsessed shallow 30-somethings. This show should have been put to pasture a couple of years ago, but now that Survivor and the WWF's popularity has died down considerably, what the hell, they'll probably re-up for a few more years. If you want to see a much better version of this show, watch S Club 7, it's leagues better and the cast can look good even when they're not trying. Of course, if you like 85 lb. women... I am quite insulted that some people think this is the best comedy since Seinfeld. Firstly, it is unfair to both shows because Seinfeld cannot be matched. I must admit that I watched a few of the earlier episodes because of the hype and the stars, but I found it mediocre, mildly amusing at best. It wasn't awful, just nothing particularly special. It was bearable to the extent that I would watch it if there was nothing else on.<br/><br/>But recently I saw a couple of episodes of the new series, and I was appalled by how bad it had become. The jokes are just not funny anymore, and appear to be based solely on the stupidity of the characters now (who were never really that bright to begin with). The characters have seem to have lost appeal and dimension, becoming very single faceted- especially Joey (I've noticed his IQ dwindle quite significantly from the first series). Ross has always been annoying, Monica has never really been funny and Phoebe has always been irritatingly unfunny. Chandler, who was quite funny earlier because his jokes were based on wit, has lost much his luster.<br/><br/>How it is able to sustain ratings is quite beyond me. I think if people step back and look at how much the show has deteriorated, they will realise that they have been watching the show for the sake of watching it rather than for any serious enjoyment. Either that or they still think the girls/guys are hot.<br/><br/>By the way, how could Aniston possibly be nominated for an Emmy? She's an adequate professional actor, but definitely not Emmy standard. Then again, Jerry Seinfeld was nominated year after year despite looking like he was going to crack up laughing in at least one scene every episode. I have been an avid watcher of Friends since day one and it never fails to please - there is always something that happens that makes me howl with laughter.  Matthew Perry is surely one of the world's finest comedy actors, and the chemistry the group has really makes you believe what is happening. I love the new relationship between Monica and Chandler - it has added spice where the on/off nature of Ross and<br/><br/>Rachel's relationship was starting to maybe get a little repetitive.  I can't wait for the rest of series five - bring it on!! Friends is the best shoe ever! it has everything anyone could want! it's fit for any age and has a GREAT cast (exept for David Schwimmer) The characters are fantastic!; let's take Rachel for starters, she's funny, spoiled, pretty, loves to shop, but when it gets to Ross she cannot let him be! if he's with someone else she wants him! but when he's all alone she could care less!. then there's Monica, I like Courteney Cox but Monica get's on my nerves with her neatness and obsessive behavior!. Nobody can forget Phoebe! she is one of the best! She usually doesn't make any sense she is very funny, I love it when she's mean to Ross and when she flirts with Chandler and Joey, oh and her songs are the funniest ever! now who can say they don't love Smelly Cat???. Then there's Joey, he's cute, funny because he's stupid and kinda slow, I like this character but couldn't stand it if he ends up with Phoebe. Then there's the BEST the one and only Chandler Bing!! he makes the show what is! without his wit and sarcastic remarks FRIENDS would be nothing, not to mention he is drop dead gorgeous!!!. And in the end there's Ross, I like this character because he makes me laugh, with he's depressing "HI" and his geaky ways, but there is just one thing.....I HATE DAVID SCHWIMMER!!! like really, really dislike him!!he is annoying and not that good looking! he has NO career outside FRIENDS without this show he'd be nothing!! I mean has anyone seen "The Pallbearer" ???? that's the worst movie ever!!! he's acting in other movies are just poor! but overall FRIENDS is the best show ever and I give it a 11 out of 10 all the 6 stars are fabulous .Their acting is flawless. Each episode is worth watching 5 times.<br/><br/>each moment is fun filled .<br/><br/>Definitely worth skipping all other tv programmes that may clash with it. Friends is the funniest show i have EVER seen! Its funny but can be serious at times. This is a show about 6 friends who have a unique relashionship. This show has made me laugh and made me cry. Its a show for everybody. Trust me you will LOVE Friends. Take my advice on Thursday night sit down and watch Friends trust me you won't be sorry! Friends is such a brilliant show. Since, the show started in 1994, every episode has been absolutely brilliant and always very funny. It's great how Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer really do there characters so well. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Rachel, Monica, Pheobe. Joey, Chandler and Ross besides these guys. Friends is one of the best shows ever, if not the best show. I love this show. F.R.I.E.N.D.S FOREVER! Let me tell you about my, "Friends." They are funny, boisterous in every sense and there is something fresh and new every episode.  How can you not like the show? The show is awesome!  I love each character equally, I would never say I like Rachel or Monica at any time.  They all do their fair share in my opinion.<br/><br/>I can't contemplate why the show hasn't won an Emmy or a Golden Globe for their work.  A whole bunch of nominations is what that show got. It needs to win, and I believe it will soon enough.<br/><br/>GO FRIENDS GO! The most overrated sitcom ever. Childish lame humour. A load of crap! Ross looks like he is always on the verge of crying, Monica and Chandler are way over the top and not funny. Joey, Rachel and Phoebe are good but I cannot believe this show is/was so popular First episodes were ok, after that Joe was the only entertainment, and sometimes Phoepe and the rest became very predictable. This show is so overrated I mean what was the hype. Why did Netflix pay so much I don't understand .It so basic .It was never a good show. So brilliant in the first few seasons when the characters were a bit more down to earth and well rounded. They become too extreme in their personalities after about season 6 (Rachel becomes ditzy, Monica too obsessive, Joey too dumb etc). Season 1 is flawless. The writing is witty and intelligent, the chemistry is always there no matter who is on screen, the secondary characters add great amounts of comedy and backstory. The acting in the first season is also great. Nobody goes too overthetop, the jokes aren't dulled down and they don't compromise each characters intelligence. I'd give Season 1 a 9 or 10 as far as sitcoms go. It just feels like a real group of goodlooking friends who each battle their own demons and console each other when times aren't so happy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the show continues over the years, the only thing that remains is the chemistry and the funny writing. The shows romantic tension is almost non existent after Monica and Chandler get together. Joey suffers so much as a believable character when the witty writing is dumbed down to get cheaper laughs. By Seasons 9 and 10 he's perhaps the most inconsistent and pathetic character in the show. Ross becomes an obnoxious creep instead of a charming and sensible friend. Monica shouts way too much aswell as Phoebe and so their character traits that were so enjoyable in the earlier Seasons such as their innocence and maturity no longer exist. Chandler goes from being this incredibly charming and sharp individual, who's seen as more of a guys guy with Joey in Seasons 1-3 to this introverted, traumatised, weak man with virtually zero charisma or  confidence.<br/><br/>In conclusion the show suffers as the writers push the characters from the earlier seasons aside to get more laughs and because of this, the shows quality suffers. It's still okay and the writing is still very funny, but the characters have to be stupid for the jokes to work and you often find yourself realising that Joey or Ross in the earlier seasons, would not have acted in such a way. The show is by no means bad, but it's definetly more enjoyable and witty in the earlier seasons. This show is great, but people treat it like it's jesus. What else is left to be said about this masterpiece sit-com? All sit-coms since this aired tries to use the formula that this show has! Shows like 'How I Met Your Mother' relies heavily on the perceived successful formula.<br/><br/>Friends is unique. It features six of the most lovable flawed characters that you could hope to meet. They each have endearing characteristics and hilarious quirks. From series one, the scriptwriters had molded their characters perfectly, and none of them swayed from how we knew them.<br/><br/>Each show had at least two themes running through it. Each character had their starring moments. The jokes and laughs were shared out equally among the cast. I can't recall a single episode that fell short in any way. Even the secondary characters that appeared in just a few episodes were wonderful - the Janice character popped up at least once in every series and was a great addition to the slick team. Ross & Monica's parents were funny, as was Phoebe's brother. It's kinda wrong to pick out a favorite character from the main six as they were all great in their own way.<br/><br/>Every screenwriter in this genre would love to be able to create a 'Friends' - but it requires more than one great writer - you need a great team of writers to keep the standards high. But just as importantly, you need the right actors/actresses!!! This is the benchmark for all sit-coms. Perfection! I have seen many many 20 + great comedy shows but this show is the best..no comedy show is greater than this..if u r missing it then u r missing out on a real deal<br/><br/>This show will make u laugh on every sec of it.. Chandler is just just too much for a any 1..just listen close to his comments and u will witness the greatest sarcastic comedian <br/><br/>Joe will be the second best in the show but all 6 of them will make it awesome.. I just wish this show never ended..<br/><br/>I have seen many comedy shows..two n a half men, how i met Ur mother, big bag theory, and the list goes on and on..but friends is the best every created..its a 10 out of 10<br/><br/>Really this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much.................................................... this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much....................................................this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much....................................................this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much....................................................this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much....................................................this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much....................................................this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much....................................................this is perfect.every body must see it.i remember joey said how are you doing?.i love you guys thank you so so so much.................................................... I have seen this TV series for several times. It is a really good sitcom. It brings me a lot of happiness. The series is just normal people's life, but it shows us the happy part of life. It affected me and even changed some of my view on life. Anyway, it is good and give me a lot of happiness. Thanks for the team of Friends.<br/><br/>I like Chandler for the most. He always has jokes. And the next one is Monica, she is manipulating, but it make the comedy be more like our normal life. And Rachel, she is beautiful. I like also her movies although they are not that as good as Friends. And Joey, he seems to be not smart, and that brings a lot jokes. Ross is fine, his English is good and his love for Rachel gives us the feeling life is good although the end of the series makes us sad to some extent. <br/><br/>I don't like Phoebe for I think she is not that friendly to China. China is not as what she thought. She shall come to China, know China and then give her comments. This is hands-down one of the best sitcoms I have ever seen. Despite what some people say, it is not playing it safe at all. There have been many imitations of Friends, and this where those entire crappy knock-offs came from. This is the original that cannot be beat. People also say the series can't be related to, but I beg to differ. If you asked any adult, I guarantee they would tell you that one situation one or more of the main characters got into they have been in also. The comedy is just one of the things I like about it. A lot of it is something recurring, like an inside joke. Most of it is sarcastic, witty, high comedy that takes a level of thinking, which is why I didn't like it until I was about twelve, when I could understand it, although my mom would watch it when I was really little, like not big enough to walk, and I could remember the theme song from when I was, like, 3 months old, and some snippets of some episodes. That is how memorable the show is. There is some low-typed comedy that you don't have to think too much about to make it funny, too, but it's not that immature potty-humor type, but some slapstick stuff here and there. The characters are memorable and lovable, because they all have quirky little things that make them different. My personal favorites are Chandler, Joey, and the completely overlooked Phoebe. Overall, it's a must-watch for anyone who wants a feel-good comedy that is not stuffy, but instead will pull you in and make you wish it was still on. I highly recommend this series, and you will not regret watching it. First of all,FRIENDS changed my life for real.I remember when I first watched Friends I was a little kid.And for more than half of my life , I am watching Friends.Why is Friends the best?<br/><br/>FRIENDS is the best because it is not just about 6 character's story and life.Its about life and you feel as though you have 6 close friends.When I watch FRIENDS,I feel like I have 6 best friends and I am the one sitting in Central Perk,in apartment and everywhere.I feel like I have 6 friends,it is not just a show.With the brilliant comedy,incredible storyline,awesome jokes and with the lovely characters this is a legend.From Joey's dumbness to Ross's dinosaur obsession,to Rachel's loves and adopting the new life,Monica's cleaning obsession,Phoebe's weirdness,and Chandler's stupid and timeless jokes, this is the best.With all the special characteristic that each character has,and with the great storyline and jokes,this is just untrue...<br/><br/>I used to watch Friends when I got sad,bored or anytime that I needed to be happy and smile.I will never get bored of it and the more I watch the more I love and laugh.I will never forget how happy Friends made me when I needed to be happy or how it stopped me from feeling so lonely.<br/><br/>When I finished the show,I felt so dull and alone ,like my friends left me.But and then I watch another 10 seasons from the beginning and I am still watching over and over again...<br/><br/>If you want to have the 6 greatest best friends in the world,If you want to watch the funniest and the best comedy show of all times,If you want to laugh so hard and get emotional sometimes,If you want to witness the greatest thing ever made on American TV;<br/><br/>FRIENDS IS YOUR FRIEND.<br/><br/>LEGEND AND THE BEST FOREVER! For me, no doubt that Friends is the best sitcom ever.<br/><br/>For ten years we see 6 characters, with fabulous chemistry between them, growing from young employees, a bit irresponsible and goofy, to full grown ups with filled lives. But not in a sad, soap opera way. With loads of fun, stressful, painful, happy and peaceful moments, Friends pushes any viewer to sit in the café sofa and join them into, sometimes a pointless discussion or a meaningful drama. This is life, with good times and bad times, clever sense of humor, great acting, superb writing, fantastic characters. And they could do it for ten years without loosing any bit of the show's magic. Amazing! I don't know why but i didn't wanted to watch FRIENDS. May be because i saw some bits and pieces from here and there. But sometime back i got the full 10 seasons from my friend and one bored day i started watching it and believe me i didn't stop until the last episode. You just become a part of it. I know there are lot of persons like me out there and if someone is reading this trust me and watch it. Its not just about the comedy (by the way its HILARIOUS) its about friendship,love & life. MUST WATCH WATCH WATCH....... ................... .......................................... ................. .................... ........ ............ ................ .......... .................. ....... ....... ......... ........ ............ Friends is an American sitcom, which started in 1994 and finished in 2004 completing 10 superb seasons. Its plot revolves around a group of six friends in New York City.<br/><br/>Alike me, people all over the world love watching every episode of "Friends" again and again. No matter how many times I watch it, I never get bored with its humour. It has become a huge part of my life. It is not just about the storyline, everything related to "Friends" is so wonderful. Every single episode is comically distinctive. This show is a true perfection. It also portrays the true meaning of friendship. All the six characters are very much different and utterly humorous. It became so famous that it had a huge cultural impact across the world. Better to say, it became a cult classic! <br/><br/>Joey's pick-line, "how you doing" became the most popular dialogue of the show and is still everyone's favourite. Chandler's sarcastically funny one-liners are still touted as the best till date. Ross' facial expressions and funny acts is a major attraction. Rachel, Monica and Phoebe complete the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>All the characters are so well-defined that they seem real-life. Their vivacious illustration have made them legends in their own way. For me, it is the greatest sitcom ever and will be close to me forever. It is truly a television masterpiece.<br/><br/>To elaborate in one sentence, "Friends" is the best thing that ever happened to Television! I have seen many sitcoms but none of them even compares to Friends. All of the six characters namely Chandler, Monica, Ross, Rachael, Phoebe and Joey are full of entertainment and fun. Each of these six characters compare to Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother for who 'Awesome' is the only word I have. Even though each episode has a different theme, the series has a definitive storyline which makes it even more interesting. The best part is the climax episodes at the end of almost every season which provide a magnificent end to the basic storyline of the season like the Monica and Chandler's Wedding etc which are generally emotional. Every character is so entertaining it is impossible to choose the best. Phoebe, however, is my favourite. Hats off to all the writers of Friends. i am speechless about this show its just an example of perfection by Kaufman and the splendid comic timing,flow of emotion,anger,laugh was simply outstanding .I have an ultimate collection of this grand show with all the ten seasons plus 3000wallpapers and clips.I give this show simply 10/10 cause there is no limit behind that.The comic timing of all the characters was superb Rachel,Ross, their chemistry was amazing and Monica and Chandler their comic synchronization was fluent and orgasmic and phoebe was the best in her confused and mixed expression role and last but not the least Joey the perfect manipulator of most inconvenient circumstances.Over all everything was so perfect that there is no chance of imperfection. I give it a perfect 10/10 from my side. I regret having watched all the 10 seasons of Friends in a span of 8 months when the truth is it should be in a span of 10 years. The regret is purely due to all the pleasure I immensely enjoyed during this period. I and my brothers saw nothing else but Friends. We discussed nothing else but friends. Summarizing this 8 month period of bliss we lived, laughed, lamented with Friends. If you have continuously watched 8 episodes without an eye blink you'll understand the level of obsession I went through.<br/><br/>If I pick my favorite character of the 6, it'll be criminal injustice on my part since I enjoyed and loved each character with all my heart.<br/><br/>Ross's the geeky dinosaur lover. I just loved the turmoil of heartbreaks he goes through with Rachel. As a doting brother of Monica, their affection towards each other is exemplary. Lesbian wife, English wife, Rachel as wife- All ending in divorces. Doting Father of Ben and Emma.<br/><br/>Chandler Bing, oh I just love this guy's sense of humor. To be able to find a joke in all situations does make him the Funny man of the group. As Monica's Husband, could there be a lovelier pair. They were a perfect couple in happiness and hardship. Chandler-Joey friendship and attachment is soul stirring. They are exactly how I wish to feel in midst of my friends. Oh My God!!! Joey  Howyou doin?- the line that makes girls fall for him. His characterization of a aspiring actor. He is exact opposite of Ross (know it all)  know it none. But he is the favorite of the other 5. They all care for him and his success. Loves Sandwiches and Sex. The part he falls in love with Rachel was incredible.<br/><br/>Rachel the star performer of the show rises from a rich spoilt kid to a wonderful mother. I can't imagine her in any other role other than the character she portrayed in Friends. Ross's dream girl, Monica's best friend.<br/><br/>Monica the Chef, the Obsessive cleaning disorder, the obsessively organized military regime following lady.<br/><br/>Phebe Buffe, the street raised lady. Her view of life is simply out of the world. She is completely wild. Such a misfit ting fit of the group. The awesome acting as pregnant women when she was really pregnant deserver's a standing ovation.<br/><br/>I wish I could keep seeing the episodes all my life with the characters not aging one bit. All good things have to come to an end. So did my relationship with the greatest TV show on earth Friends. This is got to the best comedy show I ever saw in my life. I laughed my ass off during each and every episode. The jokes are really awesome. Everybody did awesome. Chandler, funniest! Phoebe, coolest! Ross, geekiest! Rachel, stupidly funniest! Monica, obsessive! Everybody did there role splendidly. My laughter increased 10 times more when Janice got included.<br/><br/>This show is definitely coming into my DVD collection. I have watch all 10 seasons nearly 8 times and I'm presently watching it again.<br/><br/>Watch this show. Laugh your ass off. Enjoy the show.<br/><br/>A 10/10 show. It's one of the simplest ideas for a show- just 6 friends who share their lives together. But that is part of what makes it so wonderful. The 6 friends and actors have such a great understanding and connection with each other, it makes YOU want to be their friends. All 6 of them: Chandler, Joey, Monica, Pheobe, Rachel, and Ross, have their own personalities but yet still have that bond with each other. And also, because of the personalities being so diverse, it is quite funny.<br/><br/>Chandler: I know he is usually the favorite of everyone, and yes, he is my favorite, probably since I can relate to him the most. I certainly use sarcasm a lot and see his point of view most of the time. <br/><br/>Joey: He is the most childish out of the 6 but that's what you grow to love about him. Sure, he makes some dumb mistakes, I'm not gonna lie, but there's still a certain cuteness about him you can't deny.<br/><br/>Monica: I relate to Monica quite a bit too, from her competitiveness, to her OCD cleanliness everything has to be perfect. Sometimes that works in her favor and other times, not so much. <br/><br/>Pheobe: While she can be completely blonde at some times (No offense meant, I am blonde as well) she is most-likely the one who's the most wise out of all of them. Having grown up on the streets she isn't afraid to defend herself, yet is such a caring and gentle person. <br/><br/>Rachel: I find her to be the most annoying mainly because of how selfish she can be but there are times where I agree with her 100%. And she DID make it without her father's help.<br/><br/>Ross: He can be whinny and needy however, there's still something about him that you can't quite place but that makes you want to see what he'll do next. <br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my favorite shows to watch. In the entire 10 seasons they never run out of hilarious jokes, fabulous story lines, or those special bonds that make a friend. This is, without a doubt, the greatest show ever to have aired on TV. All you have to do is watch one episode where they are all in the same room. The chemistry that these actors share is incredible, and the writing is absolutely spectacular. Rarely have I seen a sitcom that is willing to add deep, personal story lines for their characters. Friends had that special something, that "X" factor. They were able to get away with just about anything, one second you are hearing joke after joke, and the next you are seeing the actors break out in tears over some big news. I was one of those people who were heartbroken to see the show end, I could not imagine what it must have been like for the actors. In 10 years the show developed more than any show I have seen, and captivated audiences day in and day out. And if they ever make a Friends movie, I'll be the guy sitting out in the theater 2 days in advance. Friends has dominated International TV screens and the attention of multi millions of Friends lovers for a decade. It has been one of the most watched, high rated and most loved sitcoms ever, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer all teamed as Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross, six best friend New Yorkers looking for their true partner and their lives.<br/><br/>Over the ten years we have known them back in "94 they we all not well known, but that's what made it so great. The group were all then getting together as Rachel is the last to join as we see the 'Pilot' in each and every ten series's we see the on and off relationship of Ross and Rachel the lesbian relationship of Carol and Susan Ross's family of children Ben and Emma Monica and Chandler's flirting relationship and then marriage Phoebe's search for her partner then in series Ten she finds mike her husband and then all comes to a close Monica and Chandler and have then two children find a house Ross and Rachel make another go of it and have a daughter 'Emma' Phoebe has a husband and Joey... well anyway. <br/><br/>It really has been over two years since 'Friends' closed and it still as disguised as it was when it first began in 1994. I know for a fact that Friends is just as famous in the UK as it is the USA and is still in the International world. Here in the UK Friends is on TV at least a minimum of 8 times a day.<br/><br/>Personalaly i believe Friends is the best sitcom to hit the TV screens and believe me i have seen hundreds of sitcoms American and British and although they are all brilliant they just don't stack up to Friends type of comedy. The reason Friends is so outstanding due to brilliant writing, directing and of course an amazing select of cast they are all hysterically funny in their own quirky way<br/><br/>It all began in sixth grade when a girl had a pencil case with the cast of Friends on the front and said 'Have you ever watch this' 'No' i said i had never heard of it Then i went to my mum's work a residential home and i had nothing to watch so i went to have a look at some video's to find what to watch and sitting there is two Friends video's so i though Hey! i'll watch one and i loved it i took it home to watch again afterwards a few days later i was ill and was off school, and all i watch Friends again and again then i went back to my mum's work and took home the other video from series one and the other was from series two and watch that an laugh and laugh and watched it again and again. <br/><br/>My sister who is 4 years older than me watched it to and she loved it to my cousin's have it all on DVD they also love it to, i always wished i could own them all then about a month before Christmas i seen 1-10 series DVD box set of Friends £190 although this was cheaper than most places i could of got it for Christmas i thought 'I don't know' then a friend i know who does spoil me i mentioned this to him and with a little persuasion he said okay he didn't mind because he knew how much i loved it a week before Christmas i bought it a great Christmas present this was Christmas 2004 everyone was impurest. Way over two years later my 19 year old sister her 23 year old boyfriend and me still laugh love it and watch them all the time, i remember a time i think it was 'The one with the Red Sweater' i literally was on the floor laughing so hard i could not breath i was crying with laughter <br/><br/>I'm so glad i found out about Friends, although Friends is still the most famous sitcom of my age group it would been hard not to find about Friends. I know people in their teens, 20s,30s,40s and 50s who say to me 'I LOVE FRIENDS IT'S HILAOUIRS' thank god David crane, Marta Kauffman and Kevin S. Bright decided 12 years to create this outstanding sitcom<br/><br/>There is so much to say about this sitcom and the characters. When i was typing this comment guess what i was watching you've guessed right 'FRIENDS'<br/><br/>I think Friends will always be may favourite and i don't know of anyone who says they don't like Friends <br/><br/>AMAZING, HILAOURIES, OUTSTANDING so many words to describe this conspicuous best loved sitcom around the world and no one will ever forget or stop selling nor broadcasting it <br/><br/>FRIENDS ABSOUTLY OUTSTANDING TO ALL THE CAST WRITERS AND Directors AMAZING JOB! I love Friends. It's quite possibly the best show ever. I mean, where else can you get a ton of humor, yet love the characters as much as your own friends? With romance and stories that compels anyone (even teenage boys), and classic lines such as, "And you never knew she was a lesbian?" (pilot episode).<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Friends is a story-driven sitcom. Each character brings something compelling as well as humor and reoccurring jokes (such as Monica's clean obsession). Yet, each brings something different. Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Pheobe, and Joey all combine to create a diverse group of interesting and diverse characters, yet a group dynamic. As different as they all are, you never get the sense that they make an odd group. They all have ties and ultimately, they all love each other. Actions such as women-crazy Joey not trying his usual sex and ditch methods with Monica, Rachel, or Pheobe show that the friends respect each other more than as just friends, but family. I think friends was the best TV show ever made and that it should and could have lasted longer. I can watch it a million times and my favorite episode is the one where no ones ready. I like that he was willing to drink the fat and that Monica was "crazy like a straw you know crazy straws" - Phoebe. My favorite friends are joey, Chandler and Phoebe. I think chandler is hilarious and phoebe is all over the place. I only wish that i had liked it when it was on TV but not till after it was over did i like it. I wish that they were still airing new episodes. I know the words to almost all the episodes and they still make me laugh.I hope to someday meet the cast of the show and get to know not only know the characters but the actors. I've seen this TV series and it is by far one of the best shows I've seen In my life. In my perspective Lisa Kudrow playing Pheobe Buffay did a great job I think she played her character great and funny. Then Jenifer Aniston is most known for her character Rachel Green on this series. Courteney Cox playing Monica Geller a funny, previously fat, and obsessive cleaning woman where everything has to be in place making it hilarious. Now the men, first David Shwimmer playing the brother of Monica as Ross. His character was a type of dinosaur "geek" and not to good with most of the ladies. Matt LeBlanc playing Joey Tribbiani an actor on a soap opera but not too bright. And last Matthew Perry, playing Chandler Bing he played a funny kind of man with a cross dressing father so he had quite a feminine side to his character, but was a bit too over dramatic when it came to acting. None the less this was a great romantic comedy television show. I've read a lot of comments on this page saying that friends is crap....DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!<br/><br/>There are so few television programmes that are actually great. Will and Grace, been there and done that rubbish! I didn't get it and it was different kind of funny. When I watched Friends, I started watching it all the time! It's got it's own unique humor to it and I find it hilarious. I have to say, I didn't like the last episode AT ALL because it was ending. To be honest, I started crying when it was over! It is something definitely worth watching and something I always want to see it over and over again, even if I've seen the episode a thousand times. This sitcom comedy is for people who enjoy actual good humor.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching! i love friends but i just thought that i would add another goof that i have noticed when watching friends. on the episode 'the one with the mugging' when joey has an audition with a famous actor and after realising that when joey needed the toilet helped him with impressing Leonard (famous actor/director), joey visits Monica and Chandler's apartment for more drinks. after going to the fridge joey returns with bottles of water and juices, but when the camera moves away and returns to him again joey has different drinks such as cans of coke and other fizzy drinks. i have noticed all the other goofs that there are also but i just thought that i would point out this one thanks. Gosh, if I had friends like the six friends in this series, my life would definitely amount to something! The show has changed my whole outlook on life. You need friends, they are a necessity, yet friends like Joey, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Ross and Phoebe are hard to find. They all relied on each other for love and support, yet were unique and independent. Isn't that something that we all yearn for? And how often do you find yourself falling in love with your best friend's brother like Rachel did with Ross? Strange, but it worked. Although personally, I thought Rachel and Chandler would have potentially made an intriguing couple but hey, that's just me.<br/><br/>Who can forget Joey going commando? Ross and Rachel 'taking a break'? Chandler's inability to 'grow up' or 'commit'? Monica's cleaning obsession? Ross' insistence that he gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist? The game that won the guys the girls' apartment? Phoebe's songs? Ross and Rachel marrying in Vegas / having a baby / finding other potential lovers / finally reuniting? And pretty much everything else that involved the friends 'being there for each other'? Well, the events, lives, loves and losses of all ten seasons will stay with me forever, right from the Pilot to the Last One. They WERE there for us and boy were we lucky. Pure entertainment and pure television genius that will go down in history. The show 'Friends' is one of the most successful sitcoms the world has seen. It has an all star cast, and fantastic writers, the raw talent of the writers is unbelievable. it is rare to get so many jokes in one episode from a sitcom, but 'Friends' never fails to please. When people watch the show, they compare themselves with one of the characters, whether it be neurotic Monica or geeky Ross, either way they shine a light on the stereo typical people in the world, making them feel better about themselves. you can tell by watching the sitcom that there is a friendship outside the media bubble, and that on and off set, they will always be there for each other. this may sound like i am favouring Friends over other sitcoms but it is the most successful, because of the witty jokes that are put into the love factor. People always say that the 'Ross and Rachel' situation is too much for a sitcom, and that it shouldn't have gone on for so long, but they are the most famous couple in the television world. Even people who aren't so keen on the show always have a favourite character or episode, and i think that shows that the sitcom has such a big effect on the world. It draws you in and makes you believe that you could be a "friend".<br/><br/>With so many personalities in the show, it lets everyone have someone to compare to: Chandler-Witty, Ross-geeky, Joey-sweet but dumb, Monica- cleaning freak (has to be perfect), Rachel-prom queen /bimbo, Pheobe-blonde, individual the show wouldn't be here today without the creators David Crane, Marta Kauffman, and Kevin Bright. Lisa Kudrow quotes 'There would be no six of us without the three of them' and that hits the point head on, they have made sure that the writers are the best, and that the actors are like they are. they opened doors for these six actors, and have given them their futures, without Crane, Kauffman and Bright, they would probably be sat at home watching the show just like everyone of us, and wishing that they could play the part of their favourite character. <br/><br/>The only reason they got to play the parts of these characters is because of their own personalities, as that was the deciding point in the casting. So before people comment on the structure of 'Friends' i'd like them to put pen to paper and write a show as successful as it, then and just then can they make remarks on the show. I like very much this show; i think it is done very well, with various stories really intricated and many many gags... It's plenty with guest star that play strange rules for their characters, as Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts or Bruce Willis.... Many themes that are in the show are well presented, with no hypocrisy or well-done-stuff-things, but with seriety and good-feelings (with many laugh too.......) I think that this show is more comic than most of other show now in TV and you feel like this guys are your amici!! I'm buyng all the series on DVD and i watch and watch it.... PS:Pardon me for my English....I know it's really bad....... Bye This is positively the best series in the world! i cant believe they stopped making these! they will never be able to make a show 1/2 as good, and no characters could replace them.<br/><br/>Rachel: played wonderfully by Jennifer aniston, is a cool pretty girl who loves to live life to its fullest and have fun, she could easily be in a relationship all the way through, most of the time she is either working in the cafe or in fashion. all the guys love her and she is a very friendly girl.<br/><br/>Monica: played by Courtney cox, is a control freak and has to have everything right. but she is a friendly girl and she has always wanted a family. When she was young, she was fat and never liked, and now she has lost all the weight she wants to have a boyfriend and live life the way Rachel used to.<br/><br/>Phobe: not the brightest of the gang but definitely the funniest, she used to live on the street and those years have taught her well and she will never forget them, she spends a lot of the time on stage in central perk singing with her guitar. she is loved by everyone and always happy.<br/><br/>Ross: brother of Monica and definitely the smartest, but don't let that fool you, he can be pretty stupid at times. Working in the museum but all the time wanting to tell people how he gave up a career in basketball. He has always had a crush on Rachel and is on and off with her the whole way through. but all in all a very funny guy.<br/><br/>Joey: The ladies man pf the group and loves all supermodels and pretty girls, he is never in a proper relationship, so when he sees a girl he likes, he just goes over to them to ask them out, he is a bit simple minded but thats what makes him the funniest. He has always wanted to be an actor and has an agent to help him.<br/><br/>Chandler: The joker, although his jokes aren't always funny, he definitely makes me laugh. He is always on and off with Janice and, for some reason, people think he is gay. HE IS NOT! he is funny and kind. He sometim,es does stupid things by accident but always trys to apologies in the end, he lives with joey for a lot of the series and they have a riot. But everything has to come to and end and he moves in with Monica when they star going out.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great show and it would not be what it is without any of the characters. While most series finales are less than stellar, I thought the Friends finale stank particularly bad. I was beginning to think that Seinfeld ended better - they brought back all the memorable characters, relived old memories, and generally engaged the audience much better.<br/><br/>By contrast, in Friends, there was absolutely no mention of Joey moving to L.A. and nothing about Ross' kid Ben, just to name a few large loose ends. They should've spent less time on the Rachel-Ross simpering sessions, which got really annoying towards the end, and a tad more time tying everything up. <br/><br/>The Frasier finale from last night on the other hand was very satisfying. Now that was a good show. I'm sitting here watching the very last episode and I see these practically 40something (well Kudrow IS 40!) actors saying words that would be more appropriate to someone easily ten years their junior. I stopped watching this show about 3 or 4 years ago and I'm amazed that the very last episode still has the characters talking about literally the same thing but anyway. Season Finale's are notoriously bad. Inevitably producers feel the need to come up with some crazy plot line, etc... blah blah blah. Maybe one day they'll just decide to do a series finale that feels like all the other episodes that made the series a hit in the first place..But I digress...Were we really supposed to care whether Rachel ended up with Ross? Afterall these years? Give me a break. Fun is fun but is Joey & Chandler worrying about how they're going to break apart their beloved foos-ball table really all that funny? Then the two of them reminiscing on all the good times they had with the foos-ball table? Can someone please pass the barf bag? Anyway, did Rachel & Ross get together in the end? Did they oh did they??? OF COURSE THEY DID!! HELLO!!!!!! Why must all good things end?  Friends is a great funny show.  I love it.  I always watch it on TV on Thursday nights, and I end up watching reruns over and over and still laugh as though I had just seen it.  I am now buying the seasons.  I am up to season 4 now.  I don't see why they want to stop making the show. Money isn't everything and they need to realize that.  I wish they would consider a reunion show sometime in the near future.  It wouldn't hurt them.  Like an hour thing to bring back the memories.  I love the show and certainly it won't die with me.  As long as the seasons are out on DVD I guess I'll be ok.  But why must you end? Please don't leave.  I don't know what I'll do on thursday nights anymore.  Maybe it's for the better, but think of the fans. Probably how funny the programme is! 6 different people all living in New York, I could think of that! But the characters are great and the situations they get into are pretty hilarious. Chandler is the funniest and is always sarcastic. Joey is lovable, Phoebe is a dumb blonde who believes in spiritual things and that's a pretty fun character to have. Monica is very obsessive and clean (these days, someone who is like this is called a Monica), Ross is quite funny when he has his moments on how camp and nerdy he is and Rachel........well, OK, 5 great characters. Fun show, impressive guests, great situations, so sad to see it go! I love FRIENDS. It's my favorite show ever. The main idea of show is brilliant because there is so much you can do with this sort of plot. I laugh every episode that's on TV. I have every FRIENDS season on DVD. I enjoy watching it because it also envolves every day life for some people. Overall, I think this is a great show and I recommend this show to all viewers who like comedy series and like to laugh every time you watch it. I got into this show about 3 or 4 years ago and I was quickly hooked.  It was always so refreshing and funny.  I was so upset last year when they were thinking about ending it after 8 seasons, and I was at first very happy when the cast signed on for a 9th season.  Yet I soon realized they should have ended it after season 8.  There were a few funny moments this year, but most of it was just lame.  The writers just really ran out of ideas.  For example, the whole Ross and Rachel drama was funny the first MILLION times, but now after nine seasons there's still talk about whether or not they are going to get back together.  And they have a baby together.  And to add to that, Joey gets a crush on Rachel while she's pregnant with Ross' baby, but she doesn't like him....but then she does and they hook up! What is that? I'm tired of the show having the friends hooking up with each other and all these other crazy story lines. I can't even imagine what the tenth season is going to be like.<br/><br/>I have the first 3 seasons on DVD along with the 20 fan favorites.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND watching the older episodes.  In fact, I think the show is great until Chandler and Monica get married.  The show really should have ended then, but what show ever ends at its peak?  Of course the producers are going to wait until it dries out its audience.  Compare the first 3 seasons with the last couple seasons.  The older episodes are much more enjoyable than the newer ones.  It was great to watch the Friends grow and become successful, but it was just more funny when they were still struggling in their 20s.  It's like a completely different show now that they are all in their 30s and have to settle down.<br/><br/>As much as I love to watch this show, I am definitely ready to say goodbye. It's time for everyone to move on. I know these guys been working long, but a cool mil an epi? That's just plain crazy. What are they doing that's so damn important that they need that much to work? The show's good, but it's not that good. You have Monica, the neurotic with an AR disorder beyond belief. Rachel, the perpetual highschool cheerleader rich girl type, and perhaps the most annoying who's trying to be independent of daddy. Phoebe, the flower child hippie person who was probably going through withdrawal at birth and tries to sing rancid songs about smelly cats with that damn guitar. Ross, the brother to said neurotic with issues of security and obsessiveness who's been divorced more times than Liz Taylor with 2 kids. Chandler, the only funny one who always appears gay on first sight. And Joey, the sandwich eating struggling actor who should struggle because he stinks with a penchant for sleeping with women. All these characters are just exaggerated forms of people we hate and would beat with a stick if we had the chance. They become funny when they're put in funny situation, but they do make me laugh. My laughing ain't all the way to the bank like their's though. The only reason that this show is still popular is because it was the first sitcom to use the whole storyline and plot. It was the original, out a while longer than the rest. so as soon as Ellen and Drew Carey and all came out (not long after) Friends already had an audience, everyone thought these other shows were clones and friends was the best. It survives now only because the characters are very over the top, extreme and daft, not to mention dumb. They seem to try to hard to make you laugh, I think the directors just want to see what they can get away with. It has been announced another season of friends to be made, I'm gonna watch the last two eps, praying there'll be a really, sad ending, that'll finally kill the show. The only "friends" on the show are Caucasian people. How is that possible? They are living in New York City and they don't even know one Afro-American, Asian, or Latin person.  The writers in my opinion are racist and prejudice. I have never seen any person of a different race/color on the show. Not even the people just walking around them during the show have color.<br/><br/>
This uni-racial show, which debuted in 1994, has never had any different ethnicities on the show that spoke or played an intricate part on the show. I have been watching the show for 6 seasons but now I think it is time to make some new friends. I love watching "Friends" for many reasons. The series is well written and acted. My favourite is the fantastic Lisa Kudrow. The characters are very well outlined (except for Monica: she's really insignificant) and i think that is one of the most important things for a tv series. But "Friends" is not the n. 1!!! I've seen many comedy really SMASHING. "Friends" is absolutely "politically correct". It's like a very well homework. But i think something like "Sex and the City", "Frasier", "Seinfeld" are the decisive 90's comedy series, not "Friends", even if it makes me laugh. But it doesn't make me think!!! This is my favourite American sitcom(with Frasier following behind). The first series was not so funny, but the series came into its own in series 2-4, then peaked in series 5 and 6, but getting a little desperate by the end of series 6. The first epiosde of series 7 is probably the funnies episode in the series, but after that series 7 goes downhill. You can tell they are getting desperate. For example, they are using more and more flash backs to the past.  The stort lines are getting weaker and I waish oss and Rachel would hurry up and get back together! Anyway, still worth watching, I have lost count of the umber of times Ive watched my friends videos, its not up there with the classics like ONly Fools and Horses, although any Americans may not regard that as a claasic,it is regarded as a classic in England<br/><br/>anyway Friends gets 7/10 Cretins . 20yrs on and it's still tedious. At least in the 90s I was high and found anything entertaining. But why do they moan in the theme tune and throughout. I wish I were Beautiful lived in Manhattan and was gainfully employed with a great career. I mean that apartment alone is worth a deal with the devil. At least shows such as 2broke girls was relatable, stealing toilet rolls and such like. I know lots of people won't agree or like this review however friends is really overrated and in funny. Without the fake laughs the show is dull and bland. Without them you won't know when to laugh because it isn't funny. The only thing I'll say is that it's better than the god awful show of the Big Bang theory. This is one of the best TV show ever. Although it was made around one or two decades before it still doesn't stop making you laugh.<br/><br/>Hats-off to Matt Leblanc's performance, man you are the king of humour your expressions, your timing perfect..!! I would say just one thing " How you doin'? :P All the other characters are also great.<br/><br/>Once you start watching it you cannot stop yourself from watching its really adictive. be it the first time or tenth you will feel the same humour and have the same fun every time<br/><br/>If you ever got free time and wondering what to do or wanna change your mood stop thinking and watch Friends. From the pilot to the last episode of series ten, the antics of Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe and Joey captured the world's attention on an unprecedented level for a sitcom. Whether Ross and Rachel would get together, Rachel's haircuts and fashion, Phoebe's mannerisms and Joey's one-liners and Chandler's jokes became water-cooler moments just as much as the story lines. Even the theme song became a hit. Friends fever was HUGE. Since then most sitcoms I've seen have done a Friends "bit" - the same scenario and lines.<br/><br/>The story arc was mainly centred around Ross and Rachel's relationship but the loves, work, family issues of the six pals were interesting, varied, sometimes ridiculous and often serious life issues. Always, however, there were laughs aplenty as the situations were made funny but a lot of the jokes were sometimes a little bit silly. It hasn't really aged well, and because it's on so much I think it's had some overkill but I still enjoy it despite knowing it back to front. Its a good giggle. Over the years, there has been a lot of discussion about which TV show should be ranked the greatest of all time. Though "Friends" has seldom topped any such list, there is no argument that it has taught us more about life and loss than any motivational speeches given anywhere around the world. So hilarious is "Friends", so ditsy, so enchanting, so wonderfully weird, so sophisticated yet so familiar that it's nearly impossible to resist its charms. It would be iniquitous of me to review something that's as priceless as "Friends", so I'll just write something that is more of a befitting tribute.<br/><br/>Like most others, there hasn't been an episode of "Friends" I haven't watched more than once. What is it that makes it so funny and irresistible? I don't know and I never knew. You find it funny when they fight, it's funny when they sulk, hilarious when they mock each other and wacky when they make up. Yet the characters aren't the people you won't find anywhere else. They're the sort of people who you run into everyday, maybe on a bus or on the street and the problems they go through are the ones you go through at some point in your life. One would call "Friends" clichéd. You've got accidental weddings, getting sloshed in Vegas and emotional breakups. But "Friends" makes clichés look pretty, partly because it talks to us in a way that makes everything about clichés seem so original. It's a very rare thing to make situations seem so familiar and new at the same time and the makers have parlayed it into a cackling sitcom. If any other sitcom has been this honest in their approach to make their views heard, I'm not aware of it. "Friends" is laudable for its honesty with which it narrates the conflicts of its characters, never refraining from baring the hardships the characters go through and how they come through with it, and how can we use the same theory in the matters pertaining to our lives.<br/><br/>All the actors are miraculous in their respective roles, but Jennifer Aniston, who portrays the spoiled brat Rachel, is the pick of the lot. Now, after the end of the sitcom, I often come across reading the many choices for the lead characters the producers originally pondered over, and chuckle at how absurd it now seems to imagine anyone else portraying the characters.<br/><br/>"Friends" is simply the best thing television has offered and someone needs to come up with something really substantial to compete with the bludgeoning impact it had on us. There have been some mundane attempts to recreate the magic but they haven't been remotely as witty and funny as "Friends". I'm one person from the two generations that have grown up with these characters and have wished on numerous occasions that the places and characters we meet everyday actually do exist. I expect many more generations to learn about life and loss from six ordinary people who know how to make millions feel good about being human beings in a difficult world. I thought Seinfeld was the funniest show I'd ever seen. I'd become a Friend's fan in 2011, and I didn't care if they repeated the show 90 minutes later on another channel. I'd watch it again, and crack up, at almost the level as to the first watch. They had a Friendathon on, one night, and I promised myself one more show, and I'd retire, but I'd say that after the next, then the next... The scripting is great as are the marvelous actors, some of whom' didn't really go onto do much, but a couple of movies. What, are the casting people over in L.A? Morons. I'd love for any of these actors to be in films I director. My favorite two, are of course Chandler and Joey. I can't understand how Matt Le Blanc, the best performer, hasn't done that much. I saw him in one lousy film, he was also very good in, Reform School Girls with Aimee Graham, where he played alongside her more famous sis, Heather, in Lost In Space. Kudrow is also great as the eccentric Phoebe, bringing a real human and wonderful character to the role. There's a great consistency comedy like in Two And A Half Men. You'd really wanna be around these six people, share their heartbreaks, disappointments, achievements, shocks, but sadly they're not part of our reality. Friends is a fantastic comedy in which everyone has their own story and would give anything to tell them at The Central Perk.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses who made this possible are Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimer, Matthew perry, Matt Leblanck.<br/><br/>It all began when Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey and Chandler were at their favorite coffee place and Monica's best friend from high school, Rachel, runs in. Soaking wet. In her wedding dress. Crying. The rest is history.<br/><br/>My cousin and Friends fanatic first persuaded me to wacth Friends and it was really good. now whenever I'm upset, she uses Friends lines to make me smile again. ... you don't need any ... other comedy TV Show! ;o) I really enjoyed the show as long as it lasted. Although it all began very badly ...<br/><br/>My cousins in Greece asked a few years ago if I watch this show called "Friends". I didn't know it then, so they told me to look out for it. When I got back to Germany, I watched a few episodes on TV. Now the thing in Germany is, they do dub the movies/shows that they show on TV and on most of the cinema screens. And although they do a pretty good job mostly, they totally screwed up Friends. I watched it with the German voices and was appalled. I might have chuckled a few times, but I was mostly irritated. Especially Phoebe (one of the characters in Friends) ... I hated her! Her voice was annoying as hell.<br/><br/>I later watched the show in English and was amazed by it's charm, wit and humor. All the characters are well written and they have their flaws and weaknesses. Some people might argue that you can't have this idealistic friendship in New York, some others have said, that there aren't enough black people for New York. But those are minor details that don't detract from the overall good impression the show leaves.<br/><br/>The last season isn't as good as the other ones, but then again, ten years is a long running time. If you're interested in a good comedy show, about friendship, respect, loyalty and love, then this is the one to watch! How did this mediocre sitcom to put it mildly become such a success? The six actors, the writers and the producers were always sure that it came from input from all concerned. Rewrites and retakes were the order of the day and several cast members came up with their own story lines. Yeah, right. But that is practically how every movie or TV-show is made since the star system collapsed. The answer is in my opinion that sitcoms pre-Friends were for people over 30 and below 50 or 60. The teen and the twenty-somethings had largely been ignored and not just by sitcom writers. Then the two creators came up with Friends which were aimed at the 20'somethings but had humor that was juvenile. That did it. Everybody was included. The people over 30 who wish they were in their 20's. The teens who looked up to the characters even young children. The characters acted totally like teens in the first seasons and they also used some kind of slang which wasn't really slang like "OH (pause) MY (pause) GOD". (not sure who actually said it first but it wasn't Janice.) The show didn't actually become better but the audience grew and what network couldn't be happy about that. So they stuck to their guns and the characters became even less mature than they were in the beginning. Come on, who could believe that six people in New York could survive without some kind of common sense. In the real world they would have been ridiculed and even despised. But success in showbiz equals talent i suppose. Before Friends premiered all actors were virtually unknown unless you saw Courteney Cox on Family Ties or Matt LeBlanc on Married With Children in a couple of episodes. David Schwimmer had been working in showbiz for years but mostly in independent films (20 Bucks, anyone). The thing that also helped put the show on top was guest stars. Jon Lovitz was the first really well-known to do so (Lisa Kudrow worked with him with the Groundlings). Then came such mega-stars as Julia Roberts who had something going with Matthew Perry, although I find this extremely hard to believe. To wrap it up talk and buzz was the key to this shows success, not really quality. "Friends" is undoubtedly the world most famous sitcom ever created (if not Seinfeld and Three Company). I enjoy the show and no matter how many time I watch the re-run I still enjoy it. There something about the show that actually works with its lively character, humor and some crazy situations.<br/><br/>As much I like the show I some how find the women character are not even as close to half funny as the men, Rachel is extremely selfish, Monica is a freak and Phoebe is too stupid and dumb telling that not very much relevant.<br/><br/>Anyway Joey, Chandler, and Ross are the funny one and do most of the joke and save the show. Joey - a very slow and sincere guy with a funny personality, Chandler - every word he says is sarcastic and Ross - a nice loving man actually the lead joker in here, but somehow he the least loved by the viewer.<br/><br/>Friend is the very entertaining sitcom that will actually work even just the re-run.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10 This sitcom is the greatest ever. I have the entire collection on my computer and I think is excellent. I have never been a great fan of anything before. I have always liked all kinds of art (music, movies etc.) But I am really feeling better after seeing a few episodes. I watched the "gang" whenever I was feeling upset or nervous. And every time in 10 minutes maximum I forgot my trouble. Lisa Kudrow offered the audience a wonderful gift-Phoebe. She is the sweetest. I love all the characters and the way the actors created them and made them grow funnier every season. Congratulations to all the cast and producers and let's hope to see the rest of five friends in Joey's new L.A home for a visit. When this show started it was GREAT! Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow, and Matthew Perry were hilarious! Courtney Cox, David Schwimmer, and Jennifer Aniston had wonderful chemistry, and the show was one of the best on TV! But now, Kudrow and LeBlanc have lost their edge, Cox seems lost, Aniston doesn't get enough of a chance to show her talent, and Schwimmer is just plain BORING! The only character worth watching is Perry's Chandler, and even that is starting to fade away. "Friends" is probably the most overrated thing to ever come out of the USA, along with "American Beauty". The characters in this "sitcom" are all so unrealistic and childish, the jokes are getting so stale from over-use and the likes of Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry have been wasted. Ever since Phoebe's songs  disappeared, this show has no reason to live, and I'm still trying to work out why it's so popular. OK, the cast is young and pretty, but that's about it. Every time I watch witty shows like "Frasier" and "Cybill", I think about what a shame it is that other sitcoms, especially "Cybill" didn't get as much popularity as they should have, thanks to the boring curse of "Friends". Notice:  If you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you may find a few minor spoilers here.  Okay, with that out of the way...<br/><br/>Please, please, PLEASE cancel this damn show already!  It was a good show at first, I used to watch it from time to time when I was in college, and it was funny.  Now, and with the current season especially, it reeks of desperation.  The network is clinging to the show, pulling out all of the stops just to keep the audience watching.  First off was the "Rachael's pregnant" cliffhanger to kick off the series.  Okay okay, you need a cliffhanger to kick the season off, but then every episode has to be a cliffhanger.  Who's the father?  Will they get married?  What do their parents think?  And when there are no more cliffs from which to hang, call in the cavalry (i.e. celebrities).  Which such a big budget, they can and have called in anyone short of the Lord Jesus Christ to make a cameo for the promos.  The show (as well as the cast) is getting old, it used to be a fun tale of the exploits of some kids right out of college making their way in the big city.  Now they've all grown up, some are married, some are pregnant, and their lives are becoming quite boring to watch.<br/><br/>But more importantly, It seems to me that with this season, the cast members are getting tired of their roles.  They're not nearly as lively as they used to be, they appear to be saying their lines grudgingly, as if their jobs went from a fun, exciting experience to a tedious chore.  And the "beautiful people only" attraction of the show has also faded.  In my opinion, early in the life of Friends, Courtney Cox was the hands-down most beautiful woman in the cast.  But now, she's slicked her hair back so tight that it looks painted on, and she's gotten so damn skinny that it's become just plain gross.  But whatever weight she's lost, Matthew Perry has found, as well as several pounds of his own.  He used to be very thin and handsome, but now he's just damn fat.  His neck has turned into another chin.  This again illustrates the lack of enthusiasm for the role.  With his six-figure-per-episode salary, you'd think that he could pay someone to exercise for him.<br/><br/>But the network plugs on, trying to milk every last penny out of the show, even refusing to air one of George W. Bush's speeches because it would delay Friends.  That really incensed me - WE'RE IN A WAR FOR OUR FREEDOM and even that's not as important as Chandler's post-nuptual bachelor party of Monica's shoes.  Truly disgraceful.  So, NBC should take a hint from Cheers, a great show that did know when to close the curtain, and cancel Friends already.  Quit beating the dead horse and let it rest in peace. I would have to say "Friends" has long since crested it's appex.  Last seasons shows were all devised as obvious attempts to steal "Survivor's" megalithic ratings.  When a show can't gain ratings on it's own ( a lesbian college kiss between the "Beatlegeuse" girl and Jennifer Anistan Pitt, come on now that's straying far from the shows baseline stories ) is a sign of serious writers block in the shows creative team.  Also, these "Friends" are really demanding when it comes to NBC dishing out the dough.  Why should NBC pay them phenomenal paychecks when average sparingly-paid people living in the wild are wiping the floor with them on the other station?  Rachael pregnant, Who's the father? Who cares!!! ( If NBC is really ratings hungry Brad Pitt will make a special appearance as the father ). I would rather watch Jeff Probst and dirty normal everyday people sturggling against each other in the bush. This show has always rubbed me the wrong way and I finally figured out why: These characters are just too petty and cruel. Perhaps that's why they each have only five friends to their name! (Four for Ross and Monica, hahaha!) Matthew Perry makes the show tolerable. The rest of 'em can rot. Why does everyone love this terrible US comedy series? It's complete and utter tripe! The cast are so smug and irritating that I nearly put my foot through the tv screen while watching this rubbish! God knows why people laugh at this drivvel. All I can say is check out the far better, more down-to-earth British comedies such as THE THIN BLUE LINE and THE BEST COMEDY EVER 'ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES'! The yanks are rubbish at comedy! Just look at Fraiser and this rubbish 'Friends' and I don't think you'll disagree with me! TERRIBLE! MISS IT! Well, after Seinfeld was over everybody turned to Friends on Thursday night. All I have to say is good choice everyone. You can always count on the show to be funny especially with Phoebe, Joey (the cutest one of them all), Ross, Chandler, Monica and Rachel. They deserved to be paid 1 million per episode. To the cast of Friends, please continue your good work on the show, everyone loves you, and hope that it last on about a few more seasons<br/><br/>You're our best tv friends "Friends" I won't lie, the show did have its moments and made me laugh. There were also some heartwarming moments and memorable scenes. However, "Friends" are highly abusive. The abuse is knit under all those seemingly incessant jokes. Rachel and Ross relationship is highly toxic. There is no respect for characters outside of "circle", they are only there so the main characters could make fun of them. It's promoting herd mentality, but the main characters are not saved either. Everyone is being devalued and shamed consistently. Outside of "humor", there is really no story going on or anything of value. On the other side, it is also promoting unrealistic life expectations for young adults.<br/><br/>"The Office", for example, makes fun of its characters all the time, but never in devaluing or hurtful way. Instead, you come to love all these personalities and their quirks. It is completely opposite with "Friends". Yuck! Friends is a good sitcom, but not the best show ever in my opinion. There are some rather brilliant comedic moments and a great assortment of characters. Friends uses certain qualities that remind me of Seinfeld. I poke fun at that with my dad, who really enjoys this series a lot more than me. Granted, the show usually repeats itself and that gets annoying. Like the whole Ross and Rachel relationship. Enough said on that. I also thought the series was a bit of a work in progress and stale during the first season. Still, the cast is pretty solid and the series started to take off by the second season. Overall, I'd say it is a good show. Yeah... Friends was an good comedy plus a little romantic TV series. Specially Joey, Phoebe, Ross and Chandler were the best characters in the show but Monica, Rachel wasn't that good as rest of them in character wise, They over act, make stupid faces, every time screwed something, I don't know but I just don't like them (Monica, Rachel) no offense though, I guess that's what their character was. I feel a big disappointment and sad and a bit anger whenever I looked at them in the show. But on the other hand I loved Joey, the way he talks were have the most funniest thing ever on this show, and the Ross's expressions. They're the true artist and have done something so great that no one couldn't ever think of forget them. And yeah.. the weirdness overload of Phoebe. Love it.. It could become a Great show without those Monica, Rachel's expressions. It became a bad soap opera during the lead-up to Chandler and Monica's wedding- and then it just got worse. The last two seasons are completely unwatchable.<br/><br/>Monica became annoying. Rachel an big executive who could afford a nanny? Please. That was a stretch. And Phoebe suddenly became a bore. Chandler became annoying because as Monica became more insane he just enabled her and humored her because he was so afraid of getting mad at her.<br/><br/>The writing became bland, the situations became unbelievable and the guy who played Phoebe's future husband is a mannequin. He has no personality or talent, he was not funny and he sucked the life out of every scene.<br/><br/>The finale was predictable and boring. They should have ended the series after season 5 or 6. I love Friends!When I was younger,I would have never watched it.I saw Courteney Cox on Scream and wanted to see her in something else,so my friend Courtney said she was in Friends,and so my obssesion with Friends begins.I think Friends was well written and brilliantly casted.Could you see anyone else playing our beloved Friends?Well,I love it and if you need a good laugh,try you'll love it.You should also watch it if you want to see you favorite actor or actress.They have everyone from Julia Roberts to George Clooney to David Arquette.Well,I hope you take my advice and try the show.If you don't like nonstop laughter it's not for you.Well,that's all I can say.BYE!! I have a problem! I am a Friends Addict! I watch it nearly every day and every day i watch it, I end up watching several episodes, and in one case, one series in a 'fun-fest of a day'! My favourite character for a female is definitely Phoebe for her wit and overall happiness. For a male, my favourite character is Chandler because of his superb sarcasm! I sometimes see similarities between myself and Chandler. Just to get one thing straight, I know that this is just a show and these are not their real characters in real life! I couldn't possibly tell you the events of the story because that would ruin the events and sheer shock surprises. Pure genius scriptwriting. There would not be one thing i would change about it! If you haven't watched it, you've missed out! Seriously, BIG TIME! Haha. And HUGE shame on you morons who say that it's pathetic. We all have lifes but we all love to have a laugh and not be miserable. So start to look on the bright side of life and notice how entertaining and genius Friends is! The storyline may be unrealistic at times but who cares, not all of us want to go home and watch a documentary on the HISTORY OF SCISSORS! OK, after friends finished like two years ago, i began watching the show. But hey! If it's a good show, it's never lame to watch it again! I've already bot 5 seasons and i no it'll be worth it! Friends is such a good sitcom because it reflects on a lives and how friends really r very important! Rachel the lovable waitress, Monica the "mother", Pheobe the free spirit, Joey the cute yet dumb Italian, Chandler the sarcastic one, and Ross the nerd. I believe that when am sad, after i watch friends, I sorta forget about the past for awhile! I love all the the 6 friends, it's just that i like some of them a little more...<br/><br/>My favorite friend would have to be Rachel, then Pheobe, chandler, Joey,and ross and monica sumtimes just annoy me! ...But I love them all! Now am gonna watch Friend!!<br/><br/>HAHA! The headline says it all.<br/><br/>Firstly let me start by saying that no, I don't hate FRIENDS but you just cannot deny the fact that the show is really overrated. I do like the show, but at the same time I have 0 respect for the script. Honestly feels like a 4 year old wrote the script. While you may argue that it is a sitcom, and doesnt really need a great script/story, it just does no justice to the other sitcoms that actually try.<br/><br/>There are so many episodes where they just drag the show for the sake of it. These are the very episodes where they just spend the entire 20 minutes either in the Central Perk or at Monica's. They just have Chandler make a few gritty comments to save the episode.<br/><br/>Oh and the show is extremely predictable, I mean if you didnt know Ross and Rachel were to end up together from the very first episode, you're just lying to yourself.<br/><br/>Anyway in summary, I feel I may have thrashed the show a bit too much. It is a good show, but not really upto the mark. It is a classic and you if you are a fan of sitcoms, you have to watch this show at some time or the other. The premise of the show is rather mundane when you consider that the idea is simply about six Generation X'ers lives after college but before marriage. Yes, we all experience an interesting time when in some sense our "family" consists of the people we interact with from about age 25 to 35 before we create a family: the people down the hall of our apartment, the people at our work, or regulars at bars. It's both an exciting and also an exasperating time because we still don't know the direction of our lives. A lot of it is about sewing wild oats and that's basically what the characters of "Friends" do, and they seem to have the most idyllic time doing it.<br/><br/>I concede the writing and casting of "Friends" was certainly on the higher end of the television sitcom spectrum. Most of the cast became stars in their own right. However, my issue with the show is that it's about six young people having a thoroughly fantastic time. The question is more about the sensibility of the American television viewing public, particularly among Generation X'ers, than the creators of "Friends". Some of the hardcore fans may dispute my assertions because as we know when loyal fans espouse an entertainment institution, it's taken as an affront. (I once criticized "The Brady Bunch" in another review for somewhat similar reasons and hardcore fans lambasted me for my troubles.)<br/><br/>I watched a few episodes of "Friends" early in its first season before I began a Masters degree program and didn't have time to watch television. Then I watched a few episodes towards its end. I felt the same about the first episodes as I did the last. Why am I watching other people in my age group having an extraordinarily good time, in fact a better time than me just watching this show? Sure, okay the characters have up's and down's, but ultimately that's also part of the human condition. I think it's a mark of Generation X culture that fans would be so enamored with a group of television "Friends" that they would deny themselves actually doing the things portrayed on the show. I had friends who wouldn't go anywhere on Thursday nights because they might miss an episode of "Friends". Television viewers would rather watch other people having fun than having fun themselves.<br/><br/>When I watch a film or television show, I want to see something which is removed from myself. I was more of a "Magnum P.I." type of viewer than a "Friends" viewer. I have heard people, even in the television and entertainment industries say things like, "I want to see myself up there" meaning they want to see representations of themselves and their lives. Why in the world would you want to see what you're already experiencing unless your own life is so banal that you need to see others living the life you desperately desire?<br/><br/>So my assessment of the series is more about Gen X'ers who aren't having the time of their lives but instead watch a series which shows how idyllic life can be. The late Leo Buscaglia used to mention this phenomenon of watching other people having a good time. My fellow Gen X'ers: turn off "Friends" and have a good time yourselves! You deserve it! And keep in mind that Rachel, Monica, Pheobe, Chandler, Joey and Ross are all fictional characters. In fact the cast members of Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt Le Blanc, and David Schwimmer were not the friends you saw on screen. Yes I believe they respected each other as professional actors but didn't "hang out" after hours. Very few of the cast members actually attended the weddings of the other cast members. You may be wondering what happened to their characters, and the answer is nothing. They never existed except as flickering images on a screen. After 'Married...with children', an episode of Friends is like going back to the Mary Tyler Moore Show. MTM had Ted and Lou, Friends has Chandler and Phoebe; the rest of the characters I can take or leave (although I have to admit Jennifer Aniston is quite nice on the eyes).<br/><br/>The situations are invariably contrived, the dialogue made for laugh-every-30-seconds audiences, and the whole thing has a warm cozy feel to it; but that's about it. I'm no great fan of Seinfeld either, but I can see how someone could rate it ahead of this: Friends is just too "nice". And how it gets a better rating than 'Casablanca' I have no idea - they're not even in the same league. My rating: 6/10 - could do better.<br/><br/>I'll watch it if I've got a cold or there's nothing else on, and I generally prefer the ones that David Schwimmer isn't in too much - that whiny voice gets on my nerves after a while. Way too overrated, has aged poorly.<br/><br/>All characters are awful.<br/><br/>Storylines aren't interesting, compare the storylines to The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, and there isn't any competition. It still is a symbol of the Nineties and it will always be, but it really was that good just before they started to lose they creativity - which happened around the end of the 5th season. I mean, all what happened in Las Vegas looked so fake, quite the worst season ending of all.<br/><br/>Then we had to swallow Joey falling in love with Rachel... aaahhhgh God. They just had no better ideas than this crap? Last 5 seasons were just like prolonging the agony by making Monica look even more psycho, making Phoebe look even more crazy and bipolar, keeping Joey in his childish mode forever while the other 3 poor victims seemed to be there just to look after them.<br/><br/>10 long seasons. 5 was more than enough. I cant describe the pain that i endured watching 10 seasons of this overrated show.I still dont know why people are obsessed with this disgusting show. How dare they call this show a comedy, a comedy is something like Will & Grace, Everybody Loves Raymond the new show Back To You Friends is nothing but drama drama drama drama tear jerker TV series like the movie ET with funny moments.<br/><br/>Yes there are funny moments, like eps The One With The Football season 3 but i wouldn't class it as a classic just funny moments, i have tryd to watch friends from the beginning but i seem to just get bored i don't hate show, i like the show however i don't think its the best or greatest sitcom out there however it is very entertaining if you want to cheer up on a raining Sunday or if your getting bullied at school and just want to watch a friends episode it will make you smile but not laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The only character thats worth watching is Phoebe Buffay Lisa Kudrow she is just hilarious when she comes out with those words and the songs is just hilarious Phoebe is the only character worth watching second is Monica, third is Chandler Joey is the worst character out of them all and the most annoying.<br/><br/>But still worth a watch but nothing to get addicted or excited too. I really do not get the hype.
Sick of seeing her face, Brad Pitt's, face and Angelina Jolie. One of the worst actresses ever. Can your colon leak into your bladder? Well if it can can it harm you? I was watching teenage mutant ninja turtles 3 the other day and I felt like I had to urinate and defocate at the same time but when I went to the bathroom both came out in my urine. It doesn't hurt but just curious I'm sure that everything that needs to be said about this show has been said by now but I just want to say a few things:<br/><br/>As watchable as the show was when you we worn out, the characters could easily be as obnoxious as they were charming.<br/><br/>Monika, I'd like to go easy on. She had a hard time with body image and weight issues even if she could be kind of mean, she is a little bit more broken than most of us.<br/><br/>Phoebe used to be my favorite character. But in time she became the one that annoys me the most. She was the original Luna Lovegood but Luna did it so much better. Your new age, healing crystal nonsense can be funny but that doesn't change that you are a poser and a hypocrite on so many things, delusional about your own level of talent that seems to want to be some warrior for social justice (an admiral thing) but you are just as problematic. To illustrate my point: remember that super sweet and poignant moment where Joey says he wants Chandler to be his plus-one to the premier? Then Phoebe has to say to Monica "I think these guys want you dress!". Not only is that a repulsive stab at men showing tenderness to each other, she ruins a great moment.<br/><br/>I like chandler. People say he's annoying but I reckon he was always the outcast kids and just wants attention anyway he can get it. He's the character I root for the most.<br/><br/>Joey is an idiot. I appreciate it's not his fault i know but let's not downplay that he doesn't know anything about anything except seducing women. I'll be the first to admit I'm jealous that's not a secret but how does this guy manage it when people who are just as attractive and know something about something fail? He's the go to comic relief to be sure but I won't hide I laugh at him more than I laugh with him.<br/><br/>And finally: Rachel. That Rachel...Yeah I get the whole spoilt girl on her own angle and that was cool for a while. But she never stopped being a spoilt, narcissistic shrew that just caused way more problems that she was worth and had some personal grown but nowhere near enough for me to want to go easy on her. David Shwimmer's character deserves so much better (not Emily she was awful and had an English accent more jarring than mine but still). He should have just gave up on her very early on. He is so much more sympathetic. They were never a will-they-won't-they, they were an always-totally-were which was the wrong movie.<br/><br/>This show is perhaps the first '90s show to feel retro with its electric guitar transitions and how it seems to think it's so edgy an hip for talking about lesbianism and pre-marital polygamy and stuff. In that regard it can be fascinating or annoying depending on your mood.<br/><br/>These writers knew what they were doing. They were clever with how the mix of clever and dumb humor made this show feel safe and friendly (no pun intended) when you were in a bad mood. It keeps finding new audiences with the new generations and even my dad just keeps watching it though I know he's seen it all.<br/><br/>My favourite gag of all time of the show is...the one that ends "baby kangaroo Tribaini".<br/><br/>For me the worst thing was that saga with Emily.<br/><br/>The ending was basically impeccable even if i am not team Rachel.<br/><br/>And one more thing: They were on a break! But even if they weren't Rachel deserved it. Wish he'd stayed with Bruce Willis' daughter...<br/><br/>The most mainstream played out sitcom ever. But still can't not sort of look forward to forceably re-rewatching it with my offspring in the far future. It'll probably still be just as popular. I would LOVE to be proven wrong though. If you wanna enjoy hood laughs, watch it from the later seasons because it's not funny in the 1,2,3 seasons as they didn't develop there yet.<br/><br/>
good series, very good and laughable Friends has some undoubtedly funny moments and was well cast. The guest appearances were fun and the storylines mostly worked. I found Ross to be an unbearably annoying character, not very funny and whiny. Monica and Phoebe were hilarious and loved their characters. This sitcom is one of my top 10 for sure,
it is amazing I watched it 2 to 3 times but still skipped a lot of scenes that I hated which are a lot BTW. I'm pretty sure that after I finished this show for the first time and decided to watch it again I skipped everything that had ross and phoebe.<br/><br/>Before i list those things. I also have to say that there are stupid but yet confusing scenes. like they could do it way better and we would have things much smoother. see a vid on YouTube by watch mojo titled confusing Friends moments.<br/><br/>Things I dislike in the show
<ul><li>Ross is the definition of cringe, awkward and stupid</li><li>The majority of the scenes that had Phoebe in them were irritating because Phoebe acts tough and arrogant and stupid.</li><li>i can't believe I'm saying this but also Joey sometimes I hate the scenes that had Joey because he's stupid too stupid.</li></ul> Was funny, but it twinged my morality a bit too much. Sorry i'm sorry, i don't know how changed my review :( Season 1: 7/10 (about 4 viewings, 3/20/2020)
season 2: 7/10 (about 4 viewings, 3/28/2020)
season 3: 7/10 (about 4 viewings, 4/4/2020)
season 4: 8/10 (about 4 viewings, 4/2020)
season 5: 8/10 (about 4 viewings, 4/17/2020)
season 6: 8/10 (about 4 viewings, 4/25/2020)
season 7: 8/10 (about 4 viewings, 5/3/2020)
season 8: 7/10 (about 4 viewings, 5/7/2020)
you start to see a decrease in quality. not sure how much money had to do with it, but i noticed that half the scenes only had two of the characters in it, like it was too expensive to have everyone on screen for the whole episode. also, they introduced the worst and most forced storyline of the entire series... a new love story between 2 characters that never showed it before. the previous seasons went away from the drama and were jam-packed with jokes, but seems like they decided they needed to go back to drama. i almost gave this season a 6/10 cause some episodes were hard to watch, but it finished strong, and also has my favorite episode of the series, the one with brad pitt<br/><br/>season 9: 7/10 (about 4 viewings, 5/14/2020)
a step up from last season but laughs are less plentiful than the early seasons and they continue with some forced drama. still enjoyable<br/><br/>season 10: 7/10 (about 4 viewings, 5/19/2020)
a lot of the jokes feel forced, and don't really make sense if you think about them. definitely one of the weaker seasons but still enjoyable. Aside from Ross and Rachel and their on again off again relationship and the total B&^%$ that Rachel is to him and the total dweeb that he is it is a great show. I mean Bonnie S3 E24 and S4 E1 is a much cooler woman the Rachel EVER is in all 10 seasons. So basically if you can shut out these two characters and their horribleness you will give this show a 10 across the board. I mostly manage so it is an 8 from me. I've watched the series so many times!
It's my favorite show in the world. "The gentle comedy", flawless performance, amazing friendship story, the set, the evolution of the characters... I love so many things about this show! I loved first time almost everything about it and It will always be 10/10 for me but sometime after re watching it I feel they showed LGBTQ community in not very serious manner what they deserved in the show. Poor written dialogues making fun of the ross' ex wife carol who played a lesbian character didn't look good sometime. Also they could have written David's story in a better way. He was a good guy but relationship with Phoebe ends with him in a bizarre way. The actor who played Ross was the best among all six friends. Some episode were like fun ride. I have watched some of them for like 10 times. if you will watch it for entertainment purpose then it is best Source of entertainment. All 10 season. What an amazing show it has great characters amazing stories and everything about this show will make you feel like no other show has made you feel before. After it ends you will feel sadness and a sense of emptiness. But i can guarantee you will go back and rewatch all of it over and over again. I love this show to death and adore all of the characters. In my opinion this is the best show ever made. I grew up watching friends. I learned so much watching it and laughed so much as well. It is timeless!! The show was first launched in 1994 i guess in the very same year when i was born , nearly 26 years old and the show still gain a massive audience and popularity! People still watching it over and over and laugh like it is the first time , it is not just comic but drama too , we had feelings for the characters, we felt like we are their friends too , we lived with them like it was real I haven't watch the whole series yet I am in a little in season 3 which is really great. I can really recommend this Series to everyone who loves sitcoms. It is so funny that you can rematch it after few years again. So I recently finished watching Friends and i gotta say, I really liked it, especially for a sitcom. I liked all the dynamics between characters and how subversive the plot could be at times, I think the characterization was phenomenal for the most part, mostly because of the cast being really talented and I think the overall writing was pretty good.
The show starts off with a very familiar feel to it, this is mostly due to the fact that this show inspired every sitcom to come out since and if you've watched any of those before this. You'll probably feel the same. The first season is pretty good, although I think it's one of the weaker seasons. I like everything to do with Rachel and Ross especially, more so than most seasons and I think Matthew Perry is at his best comedic wise here. Where this season falls short for me is in all the other characters, I never found Monica, Joey or Phoebe to be particularly interesting and they felt more like characters that where created just to fill an empty gap. This season had more of a slow sort of feel to it than later seasons which I can really appreciate and overall I'd say it was a pretty good start.
Now from this point on the show has a lot of ups and downs for me, I found some seasons to be good and some to be pretty bad actually. Season 2 picks up the pace from season 1 nicely and is a great improvement over the already solid ground work left by season 1, I found most character problems I had go away fairly quickly here and it, surprisingly got me invested in characters like Joey, Monica and Phoebe very quickly on. I think the comedy is at it's best in this season and I can safely say that everything done with the Rachel and Ross relationship was handled pretty perfectly with one surprisingly touching scene that you don't see done this well in other sitcoms.
Now season 3 as it stands, is my favourite season. By this point the writers seemed to fully understand what was working and what wasn't working and they manage to perfectly balance the drama and comedic aspects of the show. With one episode especially showing just how well adjusted the writers have become to these characters.
So up to this point, the show has managed to improve upon each season and it's pretty great to watch. When the writers sat down to write the next season it seemed as though they had studied what the fans liked and didn't like about their last season and it was pretty great. But then for whatever reason all of that seems to be lost after that, with the show having some seriously high notes and some seriously low notes, with a pretty inconsistent feel to it all. I think the pacing for the show took a huge drop after season 3 and characters like Ross and Rachel were written pretty poorly. What was once the heart of the show and it's main contrast now started to feel like an anchor weighing down the show bit by bit.
From season 5 on wards it seems the show has found its new heart, Monica and Chandler and for the most part it's extremely good. Courtney and Matthew have seriously great charm and charisma together on screen and their relationship felt earned and right for the show. But then for whatever reason, the show still chooses to have Ross and Rachel be a big player in everything. I found everything the show did with their relationship after season 3 too just be annoying or unfunny. Even in well written heartwarming moments between the two it just became impossible for me to become engaged because of how much the show chooses to drag the story out for so long.
The show is consistent in other aspects though, Matt Le Blanc is never not funny and Matthew Perry is the same, both actors are given some of the greatest writing comedic wise and drama wise. I think some of the moments with Matthew are especially great.
I think Phoebe, who is actually really funny throughout the show wasn't given the best story lines to work with as a single character but I think they later improved massively on this during later seasons and I think Monica is an exceptionally funny character throughout most of the show.
Overall I love it, It's very far from perfect but it does more than enough right to be a great sitcom. It does defiantly feel like a product of it's time and that's fine honestly.<br/><br/>
Also I love how it becomes a psychological Horror/Drama movie from the 90's when you remove Ross' thoughts from his close up shots lmao. I have to laugh because the couch is always conveniently empty for them and Ive never seen them sit anywhere else. I'm surprised central Perk doesn't insist they make a purchase. sometimes it's very crowded and only two of them are on the couch. You can watch any episode anytime of the day
It is funny , emotional , touching and fabulous I love i ove i loveeeeee my best comedy shiw i have ever seen Friends - A sitcom series revolving around 6 friends and their daily routine with some epic actors and punchline that will make you addicted to this series for your rest of lives. As a saying goes laughter is a best medicine and if you need to write a name for that tablet it would be friends Tv series. From direction to acting everything is flawless.
One of the best in history of sitcoms. Great show ever and its the best there id nothing to say about it I did watch number of sitcoms but this is the one which is top of them. Truley each character is amazingly established and emphasized. First starting with ross he is innocent. And joey is funny chandler is the sarcasm king. Monica is funny with her ocd and bossy nature. Phoobes is always a mysterious lady , rachel is very cute. Finally every episode is an perfect blend of emotions. The ending was simple and neat. Kudos to the creators. It really was so good. I still remember my heart sinking when the last episode aired. I grew up with this show. Yes, watching it back there are some very... un PC moments but it was reflective of the culture of the time and I will always love it. I'm a huge fan of comedy in general and this show never failed to make me laugh. It was little slow to me at first, but it got more interesting as the first season progressed. Chandler and Phoebe are my favorite. I love this show so much! It's like my 7th time watching it. In my opinion I hate Ross when Rachel has his baby. He only thinks about himself. But this show is still a really good show. Most of the people hate himym because they think that it is acopy from friend but in many ways i think that himym was better With the original dallas...this show stands as the best show of tv history..according to me..with one difference dallas lost its fire after season 9(dream season) but friends is always funny till to the end.
I have watched it 2x so far and will start watching again with dallas the original.....so just watch the 1st episode..then the force will be with you :))) There are very few shows in history that have the magic and charm of F. R. I. E. N. D. S
And there will be very few in future which will. If F. R. I. E. N. D. S is all that I get to watch till I die, I will gladly watch it over and over and over again. Nothing like putting Friends in and laughter begins. I can watch them over and over again without being disappointed. I LOVE FRIENDS. PLEASE WATCH IT. That's it, that's the review I loved it! I spent all summer binge watching this and just couldn't get enough of it! It's light , its bright it's easy to digest , has no big dramas involved , problems are solved its not like in real life and this is why its so good to watch and escape the sad drama of human reality . here you have 6 friends so different from each other accepting one another - and spending time together , of course its unreal ,but who cares !- i dont want real serious stuff - or laughing from misery of our existence - i want to put a film on and feel i will not get hurt and i will laugh and when it finish i will feel good - and that's what are "friends" for , yeah they are insulting ppl from time to time .. there is a lot insulting to gays and transsexuals etc but don't forget it was 90's we were just getting there to accept all of that . friends helped me a lot to overcome very bad time in my life - where i didn't want to see people suffering or being mean to each other . and they gave me a lot of laughs . thank you friends ! Perfect. .... these are the only words which can define this show This is the best TV series which i have ever watched!
Although this movie was shot long time ago,it is relevant nowdays, because all heroes very real. Their life it is the life of each of us. There are we can see a lot off different situations, which happen every day. And this series teaches us to look at everything with humor.
The humor is great! Almost every joke can be aphorism.
The cast is very nice. Every hero is perfect for his role. All seasons pleases audience good plot, great acting, funny jokes, and of course the best soundtrack.
I recommend this movie to anyone and ereyone. I adore Friends, but I've watched it all the way through several times and I keep finding more and more plot holes. Like, why do they all seem to have multiple birthdays, and why was rachel 28 in season 3, but not 30 until season 7. It makes no sense. Still an enjoyable show if you don't focus on that stuff too hard. Some episodes are better than great. I absolutely hated that they retconned things so that chandler and Monica were meant to be together, that was awful.<br/><br/>Now, onto the characters:
Ross - I didn't mind Ross as much as some people did, except the whole Unagi rubbish, that was bad.
Rachel - Was annoying. Selfish, conceited, vapid, not funny
Chandler - Everything positive people say about Chandler is true.
Monica - again, very annoying. Bearable at times but ultimately ruined episodes.
Joey - Joey was funny, and him and Chandler had great chemistry. However, there were times when it just didn't work(cow's opinion for example).
Phoebe - Anyone who says Phoebe was likeable is wrong. She is one of the worst ever TV characters. She wasn't "quirky", she was weird. And don't get me started on the whole lobster rubbish.<br/><br/>The only positive of Phoebe is Lisa Kudrow's performance is great Ive watched over five seasons of friends on Netflix....some really funny lines that made me laugh for sure...but eventually I got really tired of Rachel....and her everythings about rachel persona. so I'm going to switch to another netflix show...its really NOT all about Rachel....She treated Ross so badly for at least a season and he tried to get back but it didn't work...so now mid season 5 hes trying fix it with emily and miss Rachel has decided she still loves Ross...Im pretty tired of her antics...so even though I like the show overall, I"m going to say goodbuy to Friends and move on...maybe Rachel and ross should have done the same... F.R.I.E.N.D.S What can I say.. The best comedy and overall sitcom ever! It is about a group of 6 friends based in New York and their everyday experiences and mash ups. It is not only very humorous but makes you understand the importance of friends in life!<br/><br/>Each and every episode makes you stick to your couch and watch the bonding that they share.You never get tired of friends! It is so much close to real life. The fun ,the love ,the romance ,the "chandler sarcasm", the "joey stupidness" is just immortal. Even after 20 years of friends it is just as good and has only become better!<br/><br/>I strongly recommend you to watch FRIENDS as you will fall in love with it! Honestly the best show ever created. It's so universally liked by everyone I know. If you have never watched friends before in your life. I don't know what kind of life you've been living. It helped me through so much and just by watching an episode can change my mood for the whole day. Not only is the plot amazing but the characters as well. I feel like I can relate to every single character on the show each character is a part of me. When I started watching this show I was going through similar things that' the friends were. I love this show more than life itself. It is undoubtedly a classic, and nothing will EVER replace friends even if they tried. They just don't make them like this anymore. It is old but classic. You can't help laughing when you watch it, and you will not feel boring even you watch it again and again. It is really a release after a day's hard work. What's more, many Chinese believe that it's a perfect way to learn English by watching friends. Unfortunately, I only remember happiness instead of words.<br/><br/>I like Rachel most and I don't like Ross very much, because it seems that he is a little mean and old-fashioned. One of his lines impresses me a lot: We are on a break! Joey is definitely a good boyfriend, but maybe many girls will not marry a man like him. As is known to all, Phoebe is weird and kind. Chandler and Monica make a lovely couple. When Friends left the 2004 NBC line up it showed that the NBC network really went down hard. Along with Fraiser that left the same year as well.<br/><br/>It is about six well friends, as they are living in an apartment complex in NYC. Trying to talk about life, love, and just everyday mundane but it was the chemistry of the six actors that made it all together a huge hit.<br/><br/>We would love to have friends like these. And would love to see them on a daily basis. They were single to begin with but then Chandler and Monica got married and had kids in the finale. While Ross and Rachel had their on again, off again growing pains.<br/><br/>And the comedic touches of both Joey and Phoebe as wished that they would had gotten together.<br/><br/>Show was a golden and staple run for the Peacock Network! My name is Helen Sofocleous I'm from Cyprus, a Greek island. I actually grew up with 'Friends'. It's my favorite TV show ever. I'm writing this review because I want to let you know that I thought it would be an amazing idea if a movie was made 10 years later to see how 'friends' ended. Every summer I'm watching all 10 seasons and I just can't get enough. I really think this is a great opportunity for everyone, especially for the people that have been watching this TV show for 10 years. I don't really know if this is possible but is worth taking a shot. Please let me know what you think. I will be honored to hear back from you.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely. Without a doubt Friends is funniest TV show ever. Almost everything is excellent in Friends, the one thing I didn't like was the time when Joy and Rachel were dating. I've watched those ten seasons more than 15 times, and every time I do it I find new things, it's simply amazing. In my opinion the best episodes are: - The one with the poker - The one with two parties (the part when Ross uses Dr Green's glasses is hilarious) - The one with Joey's dirty day - The one with Unagi - The one where Rachel tells (Ross's face when Rachel tells him she is pregnant is spectacular) - The one with the video tape - The one with the last one I must say, every time I watch the final scene I feel that a very good friend is going away Are you a fan of Friends like us?

Check out more here: http://bit.ly/TVOTB_imdb I did not just watch a TV series for fun although it was really fun, I also lived with "friends" and I did learn so much. I'm not the same person before "friends". You can barely find something that makes you laugh in the meantime teaches you. Watching friend you get everything you want, laughing, crying, learning, annoying, sadness, happiness<br/><br/>I'm young and I still haven't had sex, but I think now after finishing friends I know a lot about it and I think it will help me handle my sexual life. It helped me overcome my little sexual obsessions.<br/><br/>I'm not going to adore "friends" unwisely with all infatuations; it has its own flaws, but it does have some hidden layers while you watch it. The things between friends and how they deal with their issues, that's really instructive and sometimes inspirational. I learned how to get along with people I love and how unselfish we should be at some critical points. I learned how sometimes we should be submissive and ignore ourselves; how to be compassionate about our important individuals. How to speak without talking (actually I don't know how I learned that from the series, but I did.)<br/><br/>Chandler always gets right to the point without wasting your time, directly to the ultimate point. He is the very moment joker, who never gets clichéd and is always fresh. Phoebe is extremely creative and comes up with ideas that amaze the audience with its novelty, not clichéd at all. Rachel has the greatest heart which you can hear her heartbeats. After all if I am to choose one of friends to be with, that's for sure Ross.<br/><br/>I used to be a little Monica, but I'm definitely Chandler+Ross. I'm not saying these because I adore these two characters, so I'm trying to say I'm like them; besides maybe no one really cares who I'm alike the most but with this arrangement of characters I think every specific audience can find his/her look-alike to some accuracies. That's the strength of "friends". <br/><br/>Of course there are clichéd sequences at the series that sometimes are hard to avoid because, patterns can be not enough. Like when they're apparently unwilling to do something and they come to an agreement not to do that thing, but suddenly someone breaks the ice and others follow. Actually I don't consider these repetitive sequences as a serious shortcoming for two reasons; first, the series is really long and after some time one way or another repetition comes to the way and second, we cannot say we don't have those repetitions in our routine lives, so it's going to be OK because the series is a model of real life. At some moments they really annoy you; like there have been some times that I was just like "God, I hate phoebe stop that" but compared to the scenes you are thankful of the series cast, those annoying moments are unbelievably nothing. Chandler running into Janice is really really really annoying. Theseries is not ideal, but compared to other motion pictures it sure is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I won't regret watching this show! FRIENDS, without doubt is the best sit-com ever. I watch numerous TV shows but i have never been captivated more by any show than this one. All the six main characters have done a marvelous job in depicting the day to day life in the big apple.<br/><br/>The casting couldn't have been any better. David Schwimmer as Ross, no one could have pulled it off better. An insecure, reluctant guy who always manages to complicate things.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry as Chandellar, o boy what a performance. The witty jokes and the sarcastic humor to go with the facial expressions and the body language, the best man for this particular character without doubt.<br/><br/>Matt Le Blanc as Joey, the extreme dumbness yet pulled off in such a lovable manner makes joey everyone's fav character on the show. I was shocked to see Matt Le Blanc performing so brilliantly.<br/><br/>Jennifer Anniston as Rachel, a runaway bride who is somewhat obsessed with her looks. Starts as an outlaw in the gang but smoothly becomes the integral part of the group. To this date Jennifer Anniston's best work in front of a camera.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe, no one else on the planet could have played this role as well as Lisa. A taboo figure in the gang, very weird, mysterious and in the moment. She provides the X-Factor to the gang with her bold antics.<br/><br/>Courteney Cox as Monica, an obsessive compulsive perfectionist. She provides the balance to the gang with her logical, reality based solutions. Courteney is another one who has performed out of her skin in this show.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this show, trust me you have deprived yourself of something truly magnificent. For once "great show" isn't an overstatement.<br/><br/>I have seen all 10 seasons about 10 times, even remember the dialogs in each episode :p. It is addictive, it is brilliant it simply is the best sit-com ever. There will be only a few TV shows that would match what friends could achieve. The show is truly one of a kind. 10 years of unmatched humor, unmatched satire. Some of the things that really stand out are:-<br/><br/>-Scripts....10 seasons and 238 episodes yet each episode was at par. It also showed that it isn't just about the comedy.Many believe it was just a plain sitcom, but the truth is that it was a perfect blend of comedy with drama and romance.The writings, from storyline to one liners were very original. Many of the episodes are so damn good, you'll watch them again and again.<br/><br/>-Characters....One of the rare shows where each character and contributed equally, yet each character was so unique. Rachel(Jennifer), Monica(Courtney), Phoebe(Lisa), Joey(Matt), Chandler(Matthew), Ross(David)..6 ordinary actors who together created a spectacle.<br/><br/>-Consistency....Friends, like every other show had its ups and downs. But the show had some unmatched consistency. The characters as well as the writings grew season by season. Ratings never really went down. From '94 to 2004, it engrossed more and more viewership.<br/><br/>-Connection with the audience....The jokes, The situations, The problems were ones that an average American in his 20s, 30s could easily identify himself/herself with. It covered almost all aspects of a young adult...from dating to umm, toothbrushes! <br/><br/>I would also like to debate a common argument against it....Critics do say that the show was only limited to the apartment and the coffee house. But, according to me that's what made it so consistent. The writers did the right thing to remain original and well, it worked.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it yet, believe me, you are missing something out of this world. From "The Pilot" to "The Last One (2)".....you'll be in for a wonderful ride.<br/><br/>Kudos to Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions....and to NBC. This show is truly amazing!!! I love the story, I love the characters, and I love the show all together. One of my favorite things about this show is the cliffhangers at the end of each season. The main thing about the show is the Ross and Rachael relationship. How it turned out well but then crashed and burned until the end of the show. My favorite characters have to be Chandler and Joey. They work great together. Joey makes me laugh and Chandler makes me laugh even harder. My favorite Chandler and Joey scene is in the last episode and the chick and the duck get stuck in the pool table and they had to think about how they were gonna rip it apart. But when Monica steps in she breaks it apart with a sledgehammer. Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This truly is the best show of all time. Check it out and you'll laugh and cry until the very end. "Friends" is honestly my favorite show of all time. I feel this way for many reasons. First of all, the cast is outstanding! They have a chemistry that seems effortless. Each actor sincerely IS that character. Secondly, it's funny! I challenge anyone to sit through any episode of "Friends", and not laugh at least once. It would be very difficult. The wittiness of the show makes each joke or punchline new and entertaining. Lastly, the show obviously had amazing people working behind the scenes: the directors, the writers, the producers, etc. Many other shows can't hold an audience's attention for even one season, let alone making it through ten! <br/><br/>Throughout each season "Friends" just got better and better. The only thing WRONG with this show is that they stopped filming. This show is amazing, not much else to say about it, it is a great depiction of friendship and it also provides laughter, tears and unforgettable moments throughout the series'. <br/><br/>Series 1 was a good series to get the ball rolling, it introduced the characters very well and although it was early days, you could see the chemistry between the cast members.<br/><br/>Series 2-8 were all fantastic, with 100's of laughs per episode and many great plots and sub-plots that were just as entertaining as each other. My favourite series' were both series 7 and 8, they were painfully funny and the way they incorporated Jennifer Aniston's pregnancy into the show was terrific, it felt like it should have happened and Jennifer's pregnancy was just well timed. <br/><br/>The show started to decline after series 8 with series 9 and 10 not being the best of the bunch but even at it's worse, it was better than most, so for anyone who has been living under a rock for the last 15 years and has never watched this, then I seriously suggest doing so. I'm Sorry But Everyone Who Says Friends Is 'Just Another Sitcom' Are Totally Wrong. Friends Is Possibly The Greatest Sitcom To Ever Hit The TV Screen! The Charocters Are Brilliantly Acted And The Story lines Are Very VERY cleverly Written.<br/><br/>Each Character Has Their Own Way Of Being Funny, And Successfully Achieve It.<br/><br/>Joey Tribbiani (Matt Le Blanc) Relies On His Mistakes And Cuteness To Be Funny. This Works Because He Is Acted Out Superbly By Matt. He Is The 'Babe Magnet' Of The Group But Has Never Had A Real Lasting Relationship Before.<br/><br/>Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) relies on Other People Mistakes And His Clever, Ever So Slightly Sarcastic Remarks To Achieve His Goal. Again The Same As Joey He Is Superbly Portrayed By Matthew.<br/><br/>Dr. Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) Relies On His Intelligence To outwit His Other Friends. His In And Out Relationship With Rachel Is The Main Part Of His Character. The Main Joke Which Never Fails To Get A Laugh Is His 3 YES 3 failed Marriages.<br/><br/>Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) Relies On People Making Fun Of Her Cleaning Arrangements. Her Character Is Portrayed With A Slight Romance Aspect. She Is Constantly Mocked By Her Parents (Elliot Gould & Christina Pickles) About Her Failure At Getting Married But Ross' Success, If You Call It Success.<br/><br/>Rachel Greene (Jennifer Aniston) Relies On Ross Mainly To Put Her Jokes In Place. She Frequently Places The 'We Were On A Break!' Line Into Many Different Situations.<br/><br/>Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) Relies On Different Situations For Humour. To Me She Is Probably The Best Acted In the Show.<br/><br/>Personally, I Rate Friends 10/10 For Superb Acting And Inch Perfect Scripting. Friends is a great show that deals with many different issues. I particularly took interest in the episode involving Phoebe when she decided to donate the use of her uterus to house embryos for a couple that could not have children without the help of Phoebe. This episode really stood out because it showed that there are couples who have realistic dreams that they are not able to fulfill on their own. This deals with science and the ability to create embryos without sexual activity. This episode shows why such practices should continue to be legal and the positive effects that it has on many couples in the world today. The positives of such practices seem to far outweigh the negatives such as a story that has been in the news recently. Apparently there is a woman who has been fertilized twice through in vitro fertilization and now has 14 children and no father for any of them. This is a rare case and should not be the basis of an argument against this technology. Friends did pretty much rule American comedy culture and one of the most popular programmes in the world. The premise of the sitcom is about six friends from New York starting, in their mid 20s and goes into their 30s. They are Rachel Green, a woman working in the fashion industry; Ross Gellar, a paleontologist who is in love with Rachel; Monica Gellar, Ross' sister, Rachel's best friend and a successful chef; Chandler Bing, an office manager, Ross university roommate and later marries Monica; Joey Tribbiani, an actor who loves women and food; and finally Phoebe Buffay, a masseuse and the most Bohemian of the group.<br/><br/>Friends had some top writers working on the show and kept it consituenly funny, also had drama and strong character development and you see how they all change. Everyone has a favourite character, my was Chancellor. This is comfort viewing, it doesn't matter how many times you have seen it you can just easily watch it over and over again. I grew up with Friends, and like the Simpsons at its peak a highlight of how good American television can be.<br/><br/>Friends was also able to employ top guest stars such as Bruce Willis, Tom Selleck and Hank Azaria. The key actors all had a excellent comedic timing and Friends always did well at the Emmys.<br/><br/>There are some problems in later series. Joey slowly becomes more dumber; when Friends started, Joey was not as well read as the other character but he wasn't stupid. However his intelligence level fell as the show progressed. Also Ross become more nonionic and Phoebe is made more wacky and less realist as a character.<br/><br/>Friends is comfort viewing. 10/10 - perfect rating.<br/><br/>Friends is not only my favorite Sitcom, but my favorite television show ever. Not only is it funny, it is very interesting to watch. From season one to season ten the jokes and funny moments just keep coming. Other great sitcoms like Two and a Half Men and Will and Grace still aren't as good as Friends.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts is where Rachel brings Gladys (a scary painting) into Joey's room and scares the hell out of him. Then after calling him a baby she walks out of the room and sees Glennis (another scary painting) held up by Monica and screams.<br/><br/>Another great part is where Ross and Ben prank Rachel by throwing a dummy that looks just like Ross down the stairs and gives Rachel a heart attack (not literally).<br/><br/>The funny moments like these just keep coming throughout the series and keeps you laughing like hell.<br/><br/>I recommend this show to anyone who loves a great laugh. I love this show. Its so amazing. I watch it everyday. It makes me happy. Chandler is my favorite. My favorite show. I've seen every episode. I know every line. Wish they had a reunion. So ya basically I absolutely love the show. I cannot wait to meet one of them. Well, I might one day. I hope I get to meet one of them. Ross is very funny. I love Rachel. Monica makes me laugh. Joey, oh Joey. And, Phoebe she's the funniest girl in the show! But, Chandler is my absolute favorite character. I have never missed an episode. I have probably over thirty episodes taped on my recording place. One of my favorite episodes is the one with Monica's Boots! I laughed so incredibly hard. Anyway, this is my favorite show and that will never change! Hey Fans, you can go to this site to vote for a Friends movie.<br/><br/>www.gopetition.com/petitions/we-want-a-friends-movie.html There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too. The humor is universal. I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny! Friends is hailed as one of the best sitcoms the '90s ever produced, and that high regard holds true years after it ended its phenomenal run. It is often considered a more universal show than others in its league. On the surface, it seems typical: a few locations the characters frequent, laugh track, situational irony. What differentiates the show, however, is very much its core idea - friendship against all odds. It may seem difficult to make such a concept as funny as it became in the hands of the creators, but the show manages with ease, even in the beginning when the group still seemed rough around the edges.<br/><br/>Almost right away, Friends adapted a strongly serialized format - creating story arcs that lasted for whole seasons, at times; references to past occurrences; continuing plot lines from one episode to the next, and from season to season. Though some might find this concept too soap opera-like, the main intention is clear: it mirrors real life. The show never tried to shove morals down viewers' throats, condescend to lowbrow humour, or be drastically different (and yet just by doing this, it was different).<br/><br/>Throughout the show's run, even though there were points where the quality dipped just a little, the writing and setup remained razor-sharp, something unexpected due to its nature. For many of the 'milestone' episodes, the show's original creators, David Crane and Marta Kauffman, would take over writing and remind us what made the characters so endearing, real, and hilarious. And that's where the real strength lies: The ensemble cast worked seamlessly together, never missing a beat from episode to episode. On their own, they could shine; but together, they took on a new concept. Some story lines broke them off into groups of two or three, and each character had a different dynamic with every other character, creating a complexity that, again, was unexpected.<br/><br/>But behind all this, the show had a wonderful simplicity. The characterizations could not be broken down easily, although each one had neuroses and real-life qualities, and they were all simply trying to get through life with each other's help. Along the way, four of the six eventually paired off within the group (Monica and Chandler about halfway through; Ross and Rachel, off-and-on throughout), and it only strengthened the bonds and the humour, rather than failing miserably, as it may have done in the hands of some. To quote a recent editorial on the best TV shows ever: It claimed to be about friends, but it was really about family. Friends are definitely the best show ever! I love the characters, I love the jokes, I love that they all look like us which makes the sitcom more realistic. Monica,Rachel,Phoebe,Chandler,Ross and Joey every day face with the same problems that we do. Recently I bought DVD with all seasons of the show and every evening after a hard day on work I sit in front of the TV and just enjoying it! Friends help me to relax and forget about bad stuff. I'd like to thank all the creators of the show who had so many ideas and a really good sense of humor! And thank you for casting all these amazing actors who were all great playing the funniest characters on TV!!!!! Let me tell you my experience about the show. I come from a small town in India.I never knew about "F.R.I.E.N.D.S.".I joined my college in 2005 and my friends recommended me to watch "F.R.I.E.N.D.S." in DEC 2006, from that time I am just watching it, watching it and just watching it.... From December 2006, I have watched all the entire 10 episodes 5 times and my 6th run is on 2nd season.I got everything about friends.Their 10 seasons, all their interviews,fonts,pics,gag reels,phoebe's songs,title videos etc.. I watched That 70s show, sex and city, how i met your mother, coupling, Seinfeld etc.. all sitcoms, but nothing was so compared to F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Each episode of friends makes you feel like a heaven.And want you to feel .."ohh!! thats true.. , we should enjoy our life in that way, dealing with all our complications in life."Thats how friends live, thats how friends are.. As the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. season goes on .. its get better and better.The chemistry between those six people is so perfect that the same "Joey's funny stupidity ,Monica's self obsessiveness,Ross facial expressions,Chandler's sarcasm,Phoebe's craziness,Rachels's sweetness " makes you laugh in each and every episode.<br/><br/>Surely its the best ever made TV series. This is one of my favourite TV comedy because it went on for around 10 years and there is not one episode i didn't like. It never took it to far it was always within the boundaries of a good comedy. I also like the fact that they sometimes put a really famous and good actor in like Brad Pitt and Danny DeVito. It is the perfect TV show to watch because there is no complications you always understand. It is so easy because there is so few places like: central perk and the apartments. But most episodes they do go to different places but those two are probably always in them apart from when they go to London but phoebe is still in the apartment but when they go to las Vegas its all there. Definitely a must watch. Wowwwwwwww.......what an amazing sitcom...I haven't got a chance to watch this one when it was on TV...then one of my friend suggested to watch it on a DVD...and it all started...Starting from the first episode, I was completely attracted into this one...watching every season wanted me to watch more...I enjoyed each and every episodes and every season..it was really hard for me to end while watching the final season...<br/><br/>Really amazing set of actors...those characters have lived with me for those days...I liked each and every character...joey,chandler,ross,monica,rachel and phoebe...i can tell these name if u ask me in sleep...;-) I have bought a complete full set of DVD's...so the I can watch it again and again....:-) Almost everyone knows a personality like someone in the group, because they're all so purposely different. They may hug a lot more than mates on the other side of the Atlantic do, but they're there for all the major events in each others lives, and they're just as capable of helping you through tough times as they are of joking about trivial things. In the later seasons they also became more relaxed about allowing guest stars to shine too, and along with a variety of superstar names we got a couple of new characters added to the mix, such as Paul Rudd's "Mike Hannigan".<br/><br/>Every season has its classic episodes which don't seem to date, even after multiple repeats. If I had to say which character I related to most it would be Ross, with his buried and much-discussed feelings for Rachel. The writers made him more uptight in later seasons and strayed too far away from his endearing 'underdog' quality that resonated so well, but that isn't to say that all changes to the group dynamic through the years were mistakes. I thought the Monica-Chandler pairing were a believable and sweet couple, and including various kids in the setup was realistic as time moved on and each member of the clique got older. In ten years there were no miscalculations that caused the show to leap badly off track, and that's a testament to the always high-quality writing. Sure there were a few ill-advised stunts towards the end of its run (Rachel and Joey almost but never quite happening, Rachel's lesbian kiss with a hot woman conveniently played by Winona Ryder... ) but the jokes were still consistently funny even if you didn't always buy the angles.<br/><br/>Yet another in the proud tradition of quality long-running American sitcoms. I don't think Friends will ever fizz out. It is great!!! Each episode guarantees you laughs and enjoyment and each episode is also very well written out and acted. Even the arguments can be hilarious!! Each character has their own individual history, and gradually, the viewer finds out about these, which I think is great.<br/><br/>The see-saw with Ross and Rachel was great, especially when they got back together in the end.<br/><br/>If it did go on for another series or two, I would have liked to see Joey and Phoebe together! They suit each other, after all, he did propose to her!<br/><br/>The last series was cleverly ended too. It is a show that I think will stay in everyones DVD collection for years to come. This is show is about the lives of six people who are very good friends. They get into very funny situations and its also very touching at times. It is very good that the show went on for as long as I did. My favorites are Joey, Chandler, Lisa Kudbrow and Jennifer Aniston, she's super hot!! Although I don't really like the Mathew Perry character cause he's kinda gay. Anyway this is such a great TV show and it never gets old. I have never laughed harder than at some of the episodes like the one where the stripper cries or The one where Rachel has a baby, I laughed my ass off every time I see it. Its shows like this one. That really make me appreciate American television.<br/><br/>Overall this is an hilarious TV show and if you don't like it than your probably just some friendless loser with no life who sits around on he's fat ass and eats tacos all day.<br/><br/>Bob The very first time I started watching Friends, way back in about series 5 I was reluctant. I thought the humour would be too American for me (I'm English) I would find it irritating, inane, and really not to my taste.<br/><br/>One of my female friends (who I had a crush on at the time) lent my a video of the start of the first series. That summer I ended up watching 2 series every 3 days, laughing my way through the lot, and within a week I was finally up to the current episodes. Since then I've been addicted. Buying the DVDs at a premium the day they came out, putting them on every birthday and Christmas list, and then putting them on as my night time watching, something regular, something to fall asleep to.<br/><br/>Then I realised about a year or two ago, I hadn't really laughed at a Friends episode for a long long time. But I kept watching. Why, because Friends is more than just the laughs, more than just the misadventures of each episode. The whole of the series and complete friends is so much more than just the sum of its parts. Together you believe you live with these characters for ten years, you aspire in many ways to their lifestyle and (possibly quite sadly) they become friends to you. Some consider that Seinfeld or Married with Children are the best sitcoms ever, but I think Friends is much better. It has something the other two don't have: romance. The jokes Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler and Joey make are very funny and just can't have enough of them. I started watching Friends since the middle of the 6th season, but I was too young and I couldn't understand every aspect of the show, also having missed the first half. But then I got the first seasons and I watched all the episodes and then it all started to make sense to me. Ross and Rachel's relationship is the main idea of the show, but along the way they started to pair them up: Monica and Chandler, Rachel and Joey for a short period of time and of course Phoebe and Mike. The show presents the life of six young friends that live in New York, their relationships with each-other and with others, their jobs, etc. Ross is a paleontologist, divorced from a lesbian that carried his child, the romantic of the group. He had a crush on Rachel since high-school and they started going out in the second season. Rachel is a spoiled, cute girl that moved to NY to start a new life and meet her soul-mate, which turns out to be Ross. Monica is a chef at a local restaurant, Ross' sister and Chandler's wife in the last seasons. She is obsessed by having things clean and she likes to boss people around. Phoebe is a weird, but cool girl that used to be Monica's room-mate before Rachel moved to NY. Chandler uses humor as a way to push people away, like a defense mechanism. He and Ross used to be room-mates in college. Joey, Chandler's room-mate, is a funny Italian actor that came from a big family. He is the macho of the group with a lot of success at women, but also a very caring person. When I think of Friends I think of: "Heey, how you doin'?", "WE WERE ON A BREAK!", Ross always getting divorced, Phoebe's triplets, Chandler's jokes and Joey who is a littler slower than the rest of them. I remember a joke with Ross and Joey that I really like. Joey goes like this: "Hey Ross, I've got a science question! If the homo-sapience were in fact HOMO-sapience... is that why they're extinct?" Ross says: "Joey, homo-sapience are people." and then Joey says this killer line: "Hey, I'm not judging!". Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Courtney Cox are perfect for their parts, it's like the director chose the actors first and then made-up the characters that suited them better. I've seen all the episodes and I just can't have enough of them; Friends is a great show and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh! I didn't get in touch with the excellent show until it had ended, but I could on the other hand buy the whole box at once! I have watched it over and over again and I miss them soooooo much every time I've seen the last episode! They are the only friends that never disappoint me!!! Most of all I like Rachel. Please please please dear authors and actors do a few more episodes or, what the heck, continue until you're all too old to work anymooore!!! :-D <br/><br/>I have never understand why Seinfeld got so liked. I think it is nice to see but I don't have to see it. Friends makes me lose track of life totally! When I'm in my watching-marathons I don't do anything else. Who needs food when there are FRIENDS???????? Wow!!! This has got to be the best show ever. I began watching it when I was nine, in the eighth season. The only reason I didn't watch it earlier was because I thought that since adults watched it, it had to be boring. But was I wrong. Now, I am the biggest Friends Fan. When it canceled, I started dreaming about the show. Do you know a bigger fan? But in Friends, you go through so many problems, and so many laughs. It truly makes your life better, if your sad, lonely, bored, or even happy. THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN IS FRIENDS!!!!!! I had "The Rachel" cut. I have Smelly Cat as my ring-tone. I want my life to be like the one Monica and Chandler have together. But doesn't everybody? I understand some people don't like Friends. But I feel that it is a show that is meant for life. If you watch (multiple episodes) you will understand. this is the best show ever!!! i can't stop laughing while watching it it's hilarious. you might even say it's spermtastic! watch it i guarantee that you'll love this show soo much that you will want to watch it everyday!!! Enjoy!!~~~ there is also one more thing ross chandler monica pheobe are really funny watch out for them cuz they will keep you entertained but mostly watch out for chandler he is the jokester!!!yyyyyyaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy chandler!!!! friends also has a really good plot watch it and you'll agree with me that it is the best show you have ever watched in your entire life!! make sure you watch it is the bom!! don't forget to watch it and by the way the show is called FRIENDS!! Friends is by far the best show ever. Sure you have Seinfeld and others but Friends is the greatest. In every episode you are guaranteed a laugh. All six friends become part of your life and you feel for them. Great actors put this show together and it is truly amazing. The chemistry is great on stage. Each character has a different personality. I love all of these friends and the creators did a remarkable script. Love or hate it but at least give it a try once or twice. You can see the same episode five times and still laugh. When you not feeling well and you could use a laugh, watch Friends. I promise you will love it. Has change mine and a lot of my friends lives. Not original but brilliant! Sad that it ended though. The characters are interesting, well written, lovable and everyone can relate to one of them. Who hasn't said a Chandler quote??! It's good to see an American sitcom that isn't stereotypical with the American Dream so prevalent. There's no big houses, quiet suburbs, stereotypical teenagers and doesn't bother with "hard pressing " issues such as drugs. This show reminds us why we have so much American TV because all the other channels want there own Friends. When it ended it was an end of an fantastic era and this sitcom will go down as the most influential ever. F.r.i.e.n.d.s is my favourite programme ever i especially like this particular episode. Joey's fridge brakes and he eats all of the food out of it. Chandler comes along and joey asks him how chandler wants to pay him. Chandler refuses as he no longer lives there. Ross comes along later and he pushes Ross in to the fridge and blames chandler. It continues and its well funny i love joey and my favourite girl has to be Rachel because shes funny pretty and i just generally like Jenifer Anson in her movies. Shes much better than Angalina Jolie i cant bare her shes plastic. Brad was well to ugly for you and so is Vince but its your choice lol. Zara 14/f/uk After having the TV show Friends on our screens for ten years i found it very hard not to become attached to these characters.But i did become very close to these characters:Ross Geller(David Schwimmer),Monica Geller-Bing(Courtney cox),Joey Tribbiani(Matt Leblanc),Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston),Chandler Bing(Mathew perry) and Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan(Lisa Kudrow).The last episode aired in 2004 was a great ending when Ross and Phoebe raced to the airport to stop Rachel getting on the plan to go to Paris.As he wanted her to know that he was in love with her still as he had been in love with her since high school.Over the years they had had an on again off again relationship and one of Ross' funniest lines is "we were on a brake" to explain him having a one night stand.Rachel and Ross had a baby together Emma which also was conceived through a one night stand *Friends Of SPOILERS* <br/><br/>This show is the story of six friends, the sarcastic Chandler (Matthew Perry), the neurotic Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette), her nerdy brother Ross (David Schwimmer), Chandler's womanizing and not-so-bright roommate Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the spacey Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and the spoiled girl Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), and of their growing up into adult life.<br/><br/>It has managed to stay funny for 10 straight seasons, while at the same time has kept its characters mostly rooted in reality and likable.<br/><br/>That's quite a feat for a sit-com! And for us who watched the show in its original run, there is also the 'Nostalgia Factor' involved.<br/><br/>Watch it and have fun! Friends: 9/10. Friends is the greatest thing to come out of America it never gets boring and is a laugh a minute programme with a great mix of both verbal and visual humour from all six friends.Ross,Rachel,Joey,Monica and Chandler are all great characters.Phoebe is not though, she is not related to any of the other 5 characters and does not live near them unlike Monica and Rachel who live opposite Joey and Chandler and Chandlers best friend Ross is Monica's brother and Rachel's on off boyfriend and ends up living 2 minutes away so i feel it should just of been those 5 characters.Even with the irritating Phoebe it is still a great programme and by far the greatest thing to come from America excluding super Eddie Lewis!!! This show is the one of the best one's in all of TV history.I feel like these our actually my friends j/k. But seriously Friends shows great honor of friendship. Rachel and Ross end up back together at the end and Monica and Chandler are married with their two adopted twins. How come Pheobe and Joey were never together? Just wondering. A lot of other people love this show too, which makes me wonder why it didn't get the maximum stars. This is one of the few, if not only, shows that cheers me up whenever I'm down and I actually try to plan daily schedule around even though I've seen most of all the episodes. So yeah it's great. I only put that it contains a spoiler as a precaution, just in case. This has got to be at least ten lines by now. My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one.<br/><br/>My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one.<br/><br/>My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one.<br/><br/>My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one.<br/><br/>My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one. OH... MY...GOD !!!<br/><br/>"Friends" is the best TV show ever ! It's the most enjoyable sitcom ! It's absolutely PERFECT !!!<br/><br/>After the fifth time that I watch the same episode, I keep laughing at Rachel (the ex-high society kid), Monica (the fussy mother of everybody), Phoebe (the foolish girl who used to live in the street), Joey (The missed-actor very successful with girls: "How're you doin' ?"), Chandler (the sarcastic one with his engagement fear till he goes out with Monica) and Ross (The marriage & divorce specialist paleontologist) 's jokes ! <br/><br/>I like especially Chandler for his sarcastic humor but I'm fond of every character of this wonderful show ! <br/><br/>What is special in "Friends" is that everybody can find in each character an aspect of his own personality because, after all, the pals of the Central Perk are normal people. "Friends" is also able to speak about all themes without taboo and with subtlety: homosexuality, sex in general, marriage and divorce(s) (isn't it, Ross ?), love between friends and all that. I think it's a great idea and it's well done ! <br/><br/>There's something else that is special in "Friends": the capacity to have moments of emotions and moments of humor without being soppy nor unsubtle. A great performance ! Thank you Marta Kauffman, David Crane and all the writers !<br/><br/>There's also a good amount of guest stars who are absolutely excellent ! Some of my favorites are Maggie Wheeler as the terrible Janice, James Michael Tyler as the unbeatable Gunther, Tom Selleck as Richard, Helen Baxendale as Emily, Paul Rudd as Mike, Elliot Gould as Jack, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Gary Oldman, Sasha Alexander, Elle McPherson, Bonnie Sommerville, Susan Sarandon, Reese Witherspoon, Christina Applegate, Eddie Cahill, Sean Penn,... All fantastic !<br/><br/>One last thing which is great: the Ross and Rachel's love story from Season 1 to 10. <br/><br/>My Favorite Episode: "The One Where Ross Can't Flirt"<br/><br/>My Favorite Season: Season 8 (Emmy Award 2002) Wow! I really do not know how I will sum up Friends. I only started watching at some point in Season 4, but I was instantly hooked. Today I am the proud owner of the DVD box set which includes all 10 seasons. There are only a few shows which can successfully compete against Friends or reach its level of comedic brilliance. And the amazing thing is, it lasted 10 whole seasons with such an amazing consistency; without saying that the show did not grow or evolve. It has been an amazing ride throughout.<br/><br/>These characters are so approachable and real. You can so easily feel for these characters that seem so genuine. The marvel of the idea; six friends, a gang in their early 20s supporting each other at the beginning of their lives; so simple, so truthful but yet so refreshing at the time. An idea that gave us 236 episodes! It's as the creators rightly put it, the period of your life when you leave your family, your friends become your family, before you return to family again, when you start your own family. And that is how the show ends.<br/><br/>The actors were amazing from the onset of the show and I really do not see how any one of them could be replaced with someone else. These six people were just right for each other! They mix so well and play off each other even better.. one feeds off the other! They all are great comedians but pull off the drama amazingly as well.<br/><br/>Of course a lot of the credit goes to the creators as well and the writers throughout the years. The comedy has been I-can't-stop-laughing-somebody-please-help-me terrific at points.<br/><br/>There is one storyline though that I did not appreciate. I did not go along with the whole Joey-Rachel relationship. Given the history between Ross and Rachel, and indeed the Ross-Joey relationship and the characters at hand, this story is just for me something that would never happen. OK, I can follow up to the point that somehow Joey has a thing for Rachel. But Rachel (which has become a little more dumb unfortunately in the late seasons of the show) could not have felt anything for Joey! I mean, after all it is Joey! And even if she did, she gave birth to Ross's baby!! That is why I gave the show a 9 and not a 10.<br/><br/>Season 1: Where everything began! Who can forget Rachel running into Central Perk during the Pilot? Great story lines throughout the season, with the Ross-Rachel story being put into motion, endless laughs derived from Ross's divorce from his lesbian wife, Ross's pet monkey. The foundations are laid for the characters we come to love. Favorite episode is the 'TOW All The Poker'.<br/><br/>Season 2: The show continues its ride to the top. We finally get to see Ross and Rachel together, the funniest story being when Eddie moves in with Chandler. We even get guest star appearances from the likes of Julia Roberts and George Clooney. We also see the first of numerous outrageously funny flashbacks. <br/><br/>Favourite episode: 'TOW The Prom Video'.<br/><br/>Season 3: So many great episodes!! Where do I start and where do I finish? Truly amazing (how many times have I said that??). And not only the comedy. The show reaches a new high with the drama of the heartbreaking break up of Ross and Rachel which was so cleverly mixed with great comedy.Should I force my self to pick a favorite episode? For comedy: 'The One With the Football'. For the drama: 'TOW the Morning After'.<br/><br/>Season 4: My favorite! So many laugh-out-loud episodes! The show reaches its all-time peak for me. Magnificent is to say the least! So much to say.. but not enough space! All time favorite episode of all seasons: 'TOW Phoebe's Uterus'.<br/><br/>Season 5: We see the characters growing up; that is not to say that the comedy is any way diminished! With Phoebe giving birth to her triplets and the beginning of the Monica-Chandler relationship and its secrecy and the gang ending up in Vegas for the season finale, what more could you ask? Favourite episode: 'TOW Everybody Finds Out'.<br/><br/>Season 6: The two-part episodes are the ones which stand out. Great story lines still at work with the fun still coming, in a rather renewed, fresh way in combination with the successful formula. Favourite episode: 'TOW the Proposal'.<br/><br/>Season 7: The run-up to Monicas and Chandler's wedding brings out an even more control-freak Monica while other successful stories still run alongside it from episode to episode to supplement it. Favourite episode: 'TOW the Cheap Wedding Dress'.<br/><br/>Season 8: This is where it goes a bit downhill.. it gets a bit more serious and the story lines followed move slightly towards those of a soap. Yet this season still has its moments, with Rachel being pregnant and the beginning of Monica's and Chandler's life as a married couple bring new adventures on the way. Favourite episode: 'TOW Rachel Tells Ross'.<br/><br/>Season 9: The Slightly Disappointing One.. ending as it does with Rachel and Joey but other than that it still has its moments. After all it is still a season of Friends! Favourite episode: 'TOW Ross's Inapropriate Song'.<br/><br/>Season 10: The end of an era! But it was time. I'm grateful that Season 9 was not the end and we are left with some truly fantastic episodes that take us back to those first season crazy episodes. Some of Season 9 is carried along but just at the beginning to end the craziness which was left mid-drift at the end of the season. Favourite episode: 'TOW The Stripper Cries'.<br/><br/>This isn't a show to be missed! I have yet to find a show to fill the shoes of Friends I remember when the pilot episode first aired here in Britain, it was a Sunday night and i stumbled upon it by luck. Who was to know that six months later when it was released with all the proper advertising that it deserved that it would have been the most popular program to hit both side s of the globe. To run for ten years and still continue making you laugh as much from the pilot to the finale, i believe anyone connected to this master piece from the writers to the set hands should be proud that for just 30 minutes a week, they filled the viewers life with laughter and that is the greatest gift that anyone could give, so thanks Warner Brothers. What can I say about a great show, that lasted 10 years, won tons of awards, over 55 of them, had a great cast, great plot, great lines? Well, I'd say that sums up "Friends" perfectly. "Friends" was a great show, so great that a lot of people were devastated when we heard the news, that it had come to an end, including me. I loved "Friends" and still do, like I said before the cast is brilliant, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, Courtney Cox-Arquette and of course one of my favourites Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>I remember watching the pilot, and I thought it was so funny, don't ask me what my favourite line or favourite moment was, because there are too many of them. Even now that it's over, lot's of people ask me what was my favourite moment, I just smile and say, I don't have near enough fingers to count them.<br/><br/>The concept was there's 6 people who are friends, hence the name of the show, and they all live in New York. They all get together every day at the local coffee shop, Central Perk, and talk about there day, and there relationships, basically there life. The neat part is with some shows you watch it, and you feel like your watching a show, but with me and lot's of other people, when you watch the show you actually feel like your watching your friends on TV, kind of like a home movie.<br/><br/>Who's my favourite "Friend"? Well, that would have to Phoebe (played by the hilarious Lisa Kudrow), she was my favourite "Friend" and still is. I love Phoebe and lot's of people say I'm kind of like her. I guess it's in the ways we think, and were very open-minded, although I'm not a vegetarian. Jennifer Aniston though would have to be the best actor on the show, she plays Rachel Green, who has had lot's of relationships, she's been married I think 2 or 3 times to Ross Gellar (David Schwimmer). She played Rachel to a T, she was very funny and very enthusiastic. Than there's Monica Gellar (Ross' sister) who's played by the hilarious Courtney Cox-Arquette, Monica is a woman who is very, very clean and organized, kind of the opposite of me, however, all 3 are willing to lend a hand and keep an eye on the guys.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Joey, Chandler and Ross (LeBlanc, Perry and Schwimmer), all 3 of the guys are hilarious, they too have had there share of relationships, and get a lot of funny lines and sometimes don't always get each other's jokes. Joey would have to be my favourite guy, you've probably seen him in the show, "Joey", which is a spin-off of "Friends".<br/><br/>Anyways, the reason why I wish my friends were more like the cast is because the "Friends" on TV are more funnier, always willing to lend a hand, and they all work together kind of like a family. Whether it's through deaths, births of marriages the "Friends" are always there. I remember sharing countless laughs and quoting lines, and trust me, there's no show that's going to top this one.<br/><br/>So, to conclude, it was a great show, I still love watching re-runs and laughing at things that I've laughed at before. I'm gonna miss this show, it was really, really great, if I had the choice, I would give it 100 out of 10, but I can't so I'm gonna have to give it a 10, which sucks, because it should deserve a heck of a lot more. Friends. What can I say? Possibly the best US Sitcom ever created. A classic that every person must watch and will have you crying with laughter.<br/><br/>In every episode, we get to see Chandler's sarcastic wit; Phoeboe's eccentric, weird and just plain wacky attitude and blunt comments; Joey's not-as-brainy yet lovable personality; Monica's obsessive cleaning; Ross's boring nature and his so-lame-it-is-funny comments and of course, Rachel's charming wit and charisma.<br/><br/>And that's just the main cast! There's always the annoying laugh that warns us of Janice at the most unexpected times or the quiet jealousy of Gunther's.<br/><br/>Every episode is fun and refreshing with just the right balance of drama and comedy to make a very successful show. I was only 14 years old when this show came out. it took some time for me to really get into it. I didn't care much for the first season but as the show went on from Season 2 to season 10 I really got into it. If I had to pick one character I liked the most was Chander Bing. His sarcastic/witty attitude just makes me laugh. Of course there was some really touching and sad moments on the show. Like the one where Ross and Rachel go on a break or when Joey tells Rachel that he likes her or when Monica and Chander find out they might not be able to have a baby. Another thing besides the stories that make this show worth watching is the amazing chemistry between the cast members. Jenifer Aniston,Courtney Cox,Lisa Kudrow,Matt Leblanc,Mathew Perry and David Swhimmer all had chemistry despite on the set problems between David and Jen from season 9 and 10. But over all if your ever having a bad day and you want to come home and watch TV this is the show to watch. 10/10 I love this show! I even have no words to describe what I feel every time I watch it. You know, when you've got problems, you should watch it, because it makes you forget all the bad things in the world. For example, I watch it when I feel bad, when I'm very nervous, it always helps me. I feel like I'm in their company, too. I wish everyone could have as good friends, as Phoebe, Monica, Rachel, Chandler, Joey and Ross are.<br/><br/>It's so bad that the show's over. I just love these characters so much! I think, everyone can find some piece of his own character in each person of six friends. All the situations we face in our lives are in this serial. And all the familiar problems are shown there in such an easy way that you begun to think that life is not so difficult if you've got FRIENDS. Friends, in my opinion is the best television show ever and i was devastated when it ended after the tenth series. All of the actors portray unique and incredibly funny characters, and manage to keep the atmosphere and character relation throughout the whole ten years.<br/><br/>A review that i just read on the main page of Friends claims that their favorite are in this order: Chandler(Perry), Ross(schwimmer), Phoebe(Kudrow), Monica(Cox-Arquette), Rachel(Aniston) and lastly Joey(LeBlanc). This could not be more off. My favorite characters in order from worst to best: Ross: The only character that i HATE. He has very little funny lines and does not bring the atmosphere to the show that the other characters/actors do. He is geeky and annoying and takes ten minutes to get out one sentence. Also, the fact that the character(nothing to do with the actor at all) always tries to get Rachel, and cheats on her, and wants her again, and then marries another woman, and then wants her again etc. I find Ross to be a pointless and pathetic character, probably only added into the show to have an even mix of Male/Female characters.<br/><br/>Phoebe: Even though Phoebe is my fifth favorite, she is a very good character. Phoebe is the ditzy one that believes in Fate and spirits. Phoebe is very strange, and while seemingly innocent, can be very dirty at times. She delivers many funny moments and adds to the show.<br/><br/>Joey: Joey is an Italian from Queens who is an actor, though usually out of work or in dead end plays. Joey's incredible stupidity also adds to the show. He is also the ladies man and tough guy of the show, his lack of intimate feelings being the focus of many of the plot points about Joey.<br/><br/>Chandler: Chandler is also a great character. All of his one liners make up the best part of the show, but he just gets a tiny bit annoying. Chandler's parents divorced before he was 12, which gave him some psychological problems. Luckily for viewers, these problems bring humour. Chandler is a great character who is acted well by MAtthew Perry.<br/><br/>Monica: Monica is the skinny, competitive, prissy and perfect one. Monica is a chef and she strives for excellence in everything and will never give up a fight. Even though she wins at virtually everything, her parents have always favoured Ross over her, which also adds humour.<br/><br/>Rachel: Rachel is my favorite character in the show, simply because she is the uptown spoiled one. When Rachel first moves to Manhattan after running out on her wedding, she still uses her parents credit cards and has never had a job. She is witty and funny and brings A lot to the show. The only drawback of RAchel is that she falls in love with disgusting Ross, which is a real shame.<br/><br/>With the exception of Ross, Friends is easily the BEST, FUNNIEST television show ever, and i give it 10/10. i think that friends is great. Matthew perry is divine in all 10 seasons and he is just so god damn funny. i think series 5 is the best cos Monica and chandler get together... eventually. i am hoping someone will get me the full box set for my birthday or 4 Xmas cos i love friends. Jennifer Aniston is my favourite actress. The quote i like most from Chandler is " could i be any funnier" which seems to crop up in most episodes. The "hey, how u doing?" from Joey is also really sharp and witty! I always seem to find myself going "I KNOW!" because of Monica! Every episode i see, i also think of myself in later life been like Rachel, working in Ralph Lauren and blooming dales, going out with Ross, having a baby etc. i also think about how far she has come since series 1 EPA. 1 where she walked into central perk in that wedding dress. Matthew Perry is so sexy! I did not start watching Friends Until 1998 And really liked it and I dug all the re-runs. I enjoyed their friendships and their love and loyalty to each other. It was nice, witty, clever and FUNNY. I haven't a clue as to what happened around 2000 going in to 2001. The chemistry was not longer their, the actors were going through the motions and their performances were forced.<br/><br/>Also,WHAT is up with the writers and directors at this point? I mean what the hell? Toward the end the thing with Joey and Rachael? Again I say What the @#$**!!@@?Rachael had ALWAYS been so turned off and disgusted by Joey (the man not the friend) how and why on earth could she would she ever be attracted to him? BIG MISTAKE there. Of course I am forgetting to add THEY ARE FRIENDS!! What did the shows producers want all these friends screwing each other? <br/><br/>Not only that what the hell happened to the WORLD outside from the six of them. Towards the end you never really heard or saw anyone except them. How ridiculous and unreal!!! Parents, children other friends or acquaintances WHERE ARE YOU? Also What about Ross and Rachael's daughter Emma???????????????? She was like a year old where the hell was she all the time?????????? Why the hell bring that subject matter in to the sitcom and not follow through?<br/><br/>I really did enjoy this show from it's early years, at the end It Was Such A Disappointment. It honestly should have left the air in 2000. Know when to leave and not painfully drag on with petty drama. It was a COMEDY, not a damn SOAP.<br/><br/>So Long Friends, Wish we could have said good bye in 2000, when you were still somewhat funny. I recently started watching Friends. Its a bit weird that the first episode I saw was the finale, but once I saw it for the first time I knew it had a great history behind it. So I started watching season one and worked my way through the entire 10 years. I must say it is very easy to get addicted to it. What I enjoy watching most, is the trials and tribulations that go on between Ross and Rachel. I'm always eager to learn what happens to them in each season. Some people say that Friends was on television for too long. I strongly disagree, because It is a great show that people can relate to. Others say that they do not like how many of the friends get married, or how in the later seasons they get into more fights, etc. While some people think they should just go back to being friends, I say the writers of the show did the right thing. If they were just friends throughout the entire 10 years, it would get rather boring. Not to mention it is an example of real life; no group of friends stays perfectly fine forever. They are bound to have their fights, relationship crisis', etc. This just shows how life really is. What is so great about Friends is that it keeps you laughing constantly, and makes you cry when things don't work out between the characters. It has variety and thats what is so great about it. I am heartbroken it went off the air, but I sadly agree it was time for it to end. Friends will always bring laughter to those who watch it, and bring memories of a time when 6 characters were sometimes more than friends. Friends has been in my life for 10 years and I'm 12 years old. What makes me so drawn towards this show is the fact that these people are real, and that everyone has a part of Monica,Chandler,Ross,Rachel,and Joey in them. These characters aren't out of the ordinary, they feel like real people. This show is really different, I mean there is no supernatural or unnatural details in the show. Basic one word is hilarious. That's all there is to describe the show. It also seems like the names are so perfect for the characters, because I really can't imagine any other names for any of the friends. Friends is just as close to reality as a TV show could be. I am sad yet happy to see the friends go away, but i can't wait for Joey to come out this fall. With an excellent cast of new actors at the beginning as Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, Friends became in a great show from the WB which all revolves around the big troubles of these friends who live in New York. Ross and Monica are brothers, she's a chef and he's a teacher, Joey is an actor or at least he's pretending to be, Phoebe is a masseuse and vegetarian, Rachel worked as a waitress, but now she works at store fashion and Chandler is a manager. This super show was the most important ever, just because it's about the fatherhood, lesbianism, the death, homosexuality such a funny thing. Unfortunately our best show was ended, but now Joey will work in a spin off, good luck! SPOILER!! Friends is without a doubt one of the greatest shows of all time. (Of course my personal favorite) I was shocked to learn that in fact its only the 42nd best TV show of all time. <br/><br/>Of course I cried when it ended, it was bitter sweet for me. While I'm glad they left before the show started to get old and I was happy to see Rachel and Ross FINALLY get together for good I hated to see it come to a close. Friends was a world we let enter our home every Thursday night and for that 30 minutes we felt like Joey, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel were our friends as well. The finale' episode was well done there were cliff hangers, teary eyes, and some of the sweetest moments I can recall on TV. ( Joey buying Chandler Chick Jr. and Duck Jr. and Monica getting the babies she's pined for ever since season 1.)<br/><br/>Friends was just meant to be. I think if they had cast anyone differently, even one character, it would not have been successful. They were also blessed with amazing writers, Directors, Producers, the entire crew in front of the camera and behind it was amazing. Looking back at even the first season the characters already had such amazing chemistry . Everything just fell into place. Even on The Pilot the actors looked like they had been acting together for years. <br/><br/>The Spin-off Joey will be extremely lucky to be half as successful. While I wish the best to Matt LeBlanc on his solo career, I think everyone's just going to be wondering "Where the hell is everybody?" The reason other spin-off's such as Frasier work well is because there is not as much closeness. While in Cheers they are all good friends, you still don't feel that family bond such as Friends. And while Matt LeBlanc is an extremely talented actor I just think it will be too sad to see him without all his "friends". I hate to say it but they should have just let the finale' episode be the closing statement of friends. If Joey's show turns out to be great I will take back what I've said, but I've got a feeling we're looking at a flop. SPOILER I have watched Friends since 94' from the first series to the end i have to say the older series episodes were a lot funnier than the later series, but the last series was the funniest for a while. The best character in the whole of Friends in my opinion was definitely Ross, a likable funny character played by the best actor on the programme <br/><br/>Best episode has got to be when they played American football what an episode, it had it all, Ross and Monica 'the gellar cup' Joey and Chandler 'That was my fav jersey' and battling over that women. The 6 of them just seemed to have a great connection throughout the programme<br/><br/>Now onto the last episode, to be honest i was disappointed so predictable oh Rachels going to Paris yeh but u just knew that she would get off the plane and go back to Ross it got boring and predictable, the only highlight of that episode was Pheobe excellent comedy from Lisa Kudrow. Also why was the episode totally dominated by Rachel just little parts showing Joey another great actor and the destruction of the football table, and Monica and Chandler moving to a house Overall the whole of Friends has been a success and should win some sort of an award<br/><br/>9/10 When Rachel decided to get on the plane, I thought that the writers chose to have a sad ending, like with Quantum Leap, to maximise dramatic effect. I am glad that she got off the plane. The writers got to have their cake and eat it (for want of a better expression) because they maximised dramatic effect and gave us a happy ending.<br/><br/>Mike seemed to be present in the last episode as a token gesture. They couldn't exactly leave him out as he was married to Phoebe. It would have been too unrealistic if not only Chandler and Monica and Ross and Rachel got together, but also Joey and Phoebe, even though Phoebe always had a soft spot for Joey.<br/><br/>I noticed that for most of the episode, Rachel was in a miniskirt (more mini than ever before) and knee-length boots. This was a cool way to remember her, especially in the "I got off the plane" scene. While Ross' inappropriate joke about being "on a break" was a final reminder of their turbulent relationship, it would have been nice if Rachel finally agreed that all those years ago, they were indeed, on a break. (Incidentally, I think the best response to Ross' "we were on a break" came from Chandler in The One With The Jellyfish with "Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'M gonna break up with you!") When Ross and Rachel hugged at the end of the scene with the studio audience cheering and clapping, I thought it was the last scene. When I saw that I was wrong, I realised that Friends was of course not just about Ross and Rachel, so accordingly, the final scene would have all of the Friends.<br/><br/>I think the music they chose for the last scene (showing the Friends leaving the apartment and then panning across the apartment) was spot on. But I would have preferred it if the last shot peered through the window of Central Perk, showing for the last time the Friends sitting there together and chatting. In the last shot when they showed the stove, it reminded me of Monica's chef antics. And finally when we saw the framed peephole, it reminded me of the fact that whoever was living there, the door was always open to the other Friends... Literally, because they had keys!<br/><br/>Joey will have his own show now. It will have big shoes to fill. (Other TV spin-offs were Porkpie from Desmond's and of course Frasier from Cheers.) Although continuing to see Rachel would have been great for male viewers, it is most appropriate for Joey to have his own show as opposed to any of the other Friends. He is the only one who has not moved on from the first series back in 94. Chandler and Monica got married, have babies and are moving to the suburbs. Ross and Rachel have a baby and are finally together, for good. And Phoebe got married. No wonder Joey complained the most when Chandler and Monica were moving to the suburbs, and when Rachel was moving to Paris: "too much is changing"<br/><br/>One final thing before I end... The next time you are checking in for a flight, ask if the philange is okay! I only really started watching friends a couple of years ago but since then I've been a massive fan, it never fails to make me laugh.<br/><br/>
I don't have favorite episode just lots of favorite moments, like when Joey gets locked in the cabinet by the burglar and when he gets the turkey stuck on his head, then when Rachel and Ross get locked out of the apartment and Rachel starts worrying about Emma. I haven't got a favorite character, I just love the way the cast react to one another and work together to make the show funny.<br/><br/>The last episode made me cry when they all left their keys on the side. Now it's time to collect the DVD's and relive all the classic moments from a great show.<br/><br/>Even though there will never be another new episode the show will never get old, people wont get tired of watching repeats. Friends will remain as funny as ever. I guess 10 years have finally come and gone.  I have been a fan of this show over the years.  I have gone my times where I hadn't followed the series as close as other times, but it always made me laugh.  The show is just funny. As I said in my "Seinfeld" post, I am not here to debate which show was better.  They both did a fine job.  <br/><br/>Friends also contributed its fair share of catch phrases and added the greatness of six really funny characters.  Each character had their own thing, which made them stand-alone.  I just loved the situations these characters found themselves in.  Ross, Chandler, and Rachel were my favorites on the show.  Ross and Chandler were really funny.  Chandler was funny because of his wise remarks and Ross for being neurotic.  Rachel was just super hot. :) The rest of the cast was funny too.  I wasn't as into the stupid and hippie characters, but they also worked well.  There were allot of memorable episodes and I will continue to enjoy them in syndication.<br/><br/>The show ended as well as it could of.  Really now, its hard to end a show after this long on the best note.  There will always be what if we did this or that.  Just look at it as a whole and you know it ended right, it couldn't of ended any other way.<br/><br/>You had a great 10 years.  It was your time to go.  Good run. I've been a fan of this show since its 1st season...it's among some of my most favorite shows that grow up with me. when i was 14, a high school friend of mine told me there's a show on TV called "Friends" which has a great theme song "I'll be there for you~~" and said i should catch this show...so...following her recommendation, i began watching "Friends".....until now....now, i'm 24 and i still watch it!<br/><br/>
i do agree with some ppl that it seems there're no more plots in this show and should have ended long ago. Ross and Rachel, on and off and on and off for 10 yrs?!?!?! come on!!! BUT i still love this show! they give me a good laugh every week! i love Chandler's jokes, Joey's cuteness and his undenials of being a "pig" and a man who doesn't wanna grow up, Phoebe's strange temper and "Smelly cat" and many of her other weird but funny songs, Ross's constant labelling-of-himself "Doctor Ross Geller" and the like, Monica's obsession of cleanliness and order as well as Rachel's habit of gossiping!<br/><br/>
although "Friends" is losing new plots as the years go by, i think it's good to end it after 10 years, "a decade" sounds good for a show's life expectancy, right? Friends is finally almost at an end after ten years, and for a lot of people, this ending is going to be too difficult for words.  I think I am one of those people.  It's hard to describe why I love Friends so much, and why its ending is going to be so upsetting-it's only a TV show!  But ever since I was twelve years old and I made the effort to watch the premiere of Series 2 to see what all the fuss was about, I have been hooked beyond words.  Rachel was going to the airport to tell Ross she wanted to be with him, but he was getting off the plane with Julie.  I hadn't seen one episode of the first series, I didn't have any idea of the build up to this moment-Ross' infatuation with Rachel for an entire series was nothing to me. I didn't have a clue.  But I knew that I cared.  And for me to be so involved within two minutes of watching tells me Friends must be something special.  And it is.<br/><br/>At the time, I loved Frasier too.  Everyone was talking about Niles and his love for Daphne, but I never cared about that half as much as I did Ross and Rachel, even in those two minutes.  I think one of the reasons for this is just the realism of the characters. To me, as great as it was, Frasier was a show of caricatures.  Friends was about real people, with the possible exception of Phoebe.  Phoebe is probably the character with the least depth, despite the fact that she has the most interesting background (her mother killed herself, she lived on the streets).  But it's easy to get the feeling that the whole character, background and all, was originally designed for cheap laughs.  It's only in the last two seasons that Phoebe has been given a real relationship, and her forays into meaningful storylines have been erratic, which is a shame, because the emotional Phoebe moments have always been my favourites.  Whilst her lines are funny, she is deeply unconvincing as a character at times.  However, all of the other characters are identifiable, with many of the same problems that we face.<br/><br/>
Even as the episodic storylines have become rather more unbelievable in the last couple of years, the characters have stayed constant and for a sitcom, it has had it's true dramatic and emotional moments.  In Season Nine, Monica and Chandler discovered they were unable to conceive.  That's pretty heavy stuff for a sitcom, but Friends was never afraid to head into these topics. Emotion and comedy has rarely gone so well together.<br/><br/>Friends has made me laugh out loud and cry into my pillow.  It has never failed to lift me up after a bad day.  I have every single episode on DVD, and I must have seen them all at least ten times but I don't stop enjoying them and I don't believe I ever will.  Friends has something magic about it and I don't know if I will ever put my finger on what that is exactly, but I know I will always appreciate it for being there and making me smile. I admit that I did not start watching friends when it first started. I actually did not start watching friends until the 6th season, when nothing else was on. Since then I saw just how talented the actors are, and how well written the show is. One of my favorite things about friends is that all the actors have they're own different way of being funny. This way you do have to see the same thing over and over again from the different actors. Another great thing about this show is that everyone relates to at least one character from the show. Its about everyday type of stuff, and that is one of the things that makes this show so great. When I heard that the show was going off the air after this its tenth season I was very upset, but only because I think they could still do a lot more with the show. I also can't wait to see exactly how this show is going to end, and who is going to end up where. When I first heard that "Friends" was goin' off the air, I cried. "Friends" first started out as a comedy, but over the 10 years that it's been on the air, it has turned into not only a comedy, but a drama as well.  It has been a show that has touched people in a way, that no other show has. Everytime I watch the show, I don't feel like i'm watching a sitcom, I feel like i'm watchin' my friends in a home movie.  The cast is phenomenal, they couldn't have picked a better group of actors to play the characters.  Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay on the show, Phoebe is a great character, she's kind of flighty, but she is very very funny.  She's the kind of girl where if your having a bad day, you can just look or talk to her, and she'll make your day happy again.  Courtney Cox Arquette plays Monica Gellar, Monica is a neat freak.  She's VERY organized, she's the kind of girl that will make you a chocolate pie just because your feeling down. Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Greene, Rachel is your average girl, she's funny, loves to talk, and wants to be a good friend.  The girls are one of the best parts on the show, because there typical girls, who are great, the all love to talk, and make eachothers days feel a lot better.<br/><br/>
Than there's the guy who like to have fun too.  Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing, a guy who thinks he's the funniest guy in the world, but some people think otherwise.  Chandler got married to Monica on the end of the 8th season.  David Schwimmer plays Ross Gellar, (Monica's brother, and the father of Rachel's daughter Emma).  Ross is a nice guy, who likes to party, he thinks he's the coolest guy in the world, and well, I don't think he's that cool, but he's still funny.  My favourite character i've chosen to save for last, because I think he's the best, Matt LeBlanc plays Joey Tribiani. Joey is the kind of guy that will do anything to get a laugh, and he's very very very funny.  He's like Phoebe only male.  He's a great friend, and his lines are HILARIOUS.  I remember in one of the episodes he's doing an interview for "Soap Opera digest", and he's telling the interviewer, all about how he has great friends, and the interview is going very well, than the interviewer asks him a question: "What is your favourite soap opera?", and Joey says, "O, I don't watch Soap Operas, I have a life" or something like that, and it is sooo funny.  You had to have been there.  Meanwhile Joey's played Drake Ramoray on "Days of Our Lives", a popular soap opera.<br/><br/>
The show is great.  The characters phenomenal. The times that we, the audience, have shared with them are memories that will last a life time. The show draws you in, it makes you feel as if your one of the character's friends, and not just one of the show's viewers.  All in all, I give the show infinity out of 10, because it is the best television show EVER.  The show proves that, no matter who you are, how old you are, where you are, everybody needs a friend! I love this show! It never misses a beat, with its hilarious humor! Most episodes are hilarious, with only a few here and there that aren't quite up to par. The characters are so great, each one is developed enough so we can really relate to some of them. In my opinion, the best season is #2, with Ross getting Marcel the monkey, and other things. Even though the show is ending soon, reruns will be on forever. People will remember this show till the end. This is a funny show, everytime i watch friends it makes me laugh from start to finish. I love all the characters on the show, but i love Phoebe the most played by (Lisa Kudrow) she always makes me laugh. I just wish they could make another full season together, it is a bit too early to end friends now. They should film Season 11, and we can see Monica & Chandler in their new home & see how Phoebe and Mike are doing. They could go on forever with tons of jokes, and special guests. There is no need to end the show. I think friends should return and keep on going until they run out of ideas. Friends has been my favorite television show ever since I started watching it. I didn't start until like the 3rd season but I'm so glad I started watching it.I know every episode by heart.I have bought all the dvd's out and even pre-ordered season 6.I am so sad that it is going to end this year.No show will ever be able to replace it.I love all the characters.I can't sit through an episode without laughing.I am going to miss this show and miss waiting and trying to guess what will happen on the next new episode. This show is amazing, I can't believe it's ending, although it's for a good reason.<br/><br/>I'm gonna miss this Friends so much, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to turn on the TV and to know there's not gonna be any Friend waiting for me.<br/><br/>The best writing, the best actors, THE best show. And I don't care how will it finish, and I don't care IT finish, 'cause I'll just know, I can tell, they'll be there for me. I am always surprised at the amount of people who still love the TV-series Friends as it comes into its tenth year. The first few years brought a new approach to an old formula and although it borrowed heavily from previous shows like Cheers and Taxi, it still seemed to have a unique quality. But now, as the television is littered with sitcoms, Friends has become very formulaic and predictable with no real development in the characters. The earlier years when the series was developing to extice larger audiences and when it was trying to impress were the years it did impress. Now, it seems as if the cast of friends turn up to make the fans happy which generally means that there are no surpises and the programme simply becomes repettitive. Once, where friends reined as its markets niche, it seems to inspire more poor quality, unimaginative sitcoms. Now is definetly a good time to move on provided the cast don't just get handed similer characters in film scripts which would be a shame because some of the cast have some acting talent which is wasted in a Tv series with nowhere to go but down. I have been in love with Friends since it began almost 10 yrs ago.The lines were always delivered with excellent comic timing and class.The whole Rachel/Ross thing that has been dragged out for 10 yrs but still has me on the edge of my seat. Although i was deeply saddened when i found out they were really finishing off the series this time,a part of me is glad because i think any more eppsodes/series would have killed it off . Its still gonna be a dark may this year!<br/><br/>Here's to "JOEY" this fall(hopefully it wont suck).<br/><br/>
Ross and Rachel forever! Friends-****/**** Starring Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matt Perry, and David Schwimmer.<br/><br/>In this great comedy, 6 people are struggling on their own,and find a friendship with eachother.<br/><br/>What can I say, this is just great. I love it. I always laugh, and the writing is fabulous. The charecters and perfect, and the acting is superb. I Love this!<br/><br/>Friends- ****/**** Could it BE anymore funny and perfect:<br/><br/>Friends have the chance of having an amazingly talented cast.Plus as a group;it's the most connected(inside and outside the set) On Tv.<br/><br/>The writing is brilliant and the story lines are clever.<br/><br/>Unlike many other shows, you can watch Friends more than one time(I watch 4 reruns a day). My advice to all:whenever you feel depressed or sad,tune to Friends;It will cheer you up, and whenever you feel happy,tune to Friends;It will make you happier.<br/><br/>Friends,you changed my life 5 years ago,    SIMPLY THE BEST. Everyone loves Friends. And for great reason. This show has been on the air for 10 years. That is no small feat, and the reruns will show for years to come. This show is being translated and shown in other countries. You know and love your "Friends" and get all the jokes from feeling like you are right there, and you have been, for 10 years. I hear some people saying that they think 'Friends' has gone downhill, or they can't find new things to say. I personally am amazed that every series has kept up the standard, and I am NEVER disappointed. When you watch other sitcoms, they start off quite funny, and there are lots of different things going on with each of the cast. But very quickly, instead of having a FEW storylines going at the same time, they eventually run out of ideas and have just one, mildly amusing storyline. But in "Friends', the writers have really kept up the standard. I wait for the next series to come out on video, then I run out and buy it, phone in sick from work, unplug the phone, stock up on junk food and it's ALWAYS worth it. The first time I watch them is just a preliminary viewing, cos I'm so excited that I can't concentrate properly. But by the TENTH time I've watched them I'm STILL peeing myself laughing. FRIENDS ROCK..!!! friends is by far the best comedy-show ever! the characters are adorable, the actors fabulos and the dialogue sharp and great timed! BUT, the storylines are getting more repetitive and less original. till the sixth season, it was perfect. the seventh season was not so good but the eight one was great again. the ninth is just ok (but still much better than other comedy shows). and its good that the charakters are moving forward with marriages and children and moving together etc, thats ok and just natural (I mean they are all in their 30ies...) BUT, all this parenthood stuff and family-plots could be very annoying and wouldnt fit very well with our friends. so its good (and sad) that this sitcom will end. its a good sitcom, maybe the best and its the right time to stop it. (I will miss it so much, but with my complete friends-dvd collection I will get over that lost!) hope for a rocking last season! Friend forever! The current promo for the upcoming season almost brought me to tears. Already publicizing this as the last season (as if we all hadn't already heard), the net is creating nostalgia that will guarantee strong viewership throughout the 2003-2004 season. It will be a sadder day than the time we lost Seinfeld, or Mad About You (for the earlier seasons, not the last one). It's rare that a sitcom can have this kind of longevity without ever losing it's audience.  Especially when everyone assumed that the "baby curse" would be the signal of the show's demise.  Friends has reinvented and reinvigorated itself numerous times, and Thursdays will never be the same. I have been watching Friends for as long as I can remember. I think the first episode I ever saw was 'The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy', and I thought it was hilarious. But I wont go into that right now.<br/><br/>After years and years of watching a sitcom, you really feel like you know the characters, and you even pick up on little habits and things that they do. I agree that maybe it *is* starting to wear a bit thin - the actors are almost into their fortys now, aren't they? But still, it had a good run, and I have the entire Friends collection on video, so marathons are a sure thing!<br/><br/>I guess the only things that could possibly annoy me about Friends is the fact that no matter what, no matter how long it takes for them, each one of them ALWAYS ends up with the girl/ guy they have been after. Always. Even if it only lasts a week or an hour, they get them eventually. I don't know if that *does* happen for everyone, but it doesn't seem realistic. Also, is anyone else getting a bit tired of the whole 'Ross and Rachel' thing? I don't know about you, but sometimes I wonder what the hell they see in each other, when they start to annoy me. But that has gone on for far too long, and they should get over each other and find other people. Anyway, I am really not criticising (much) - it's just something I noticed.<br/><br/>
Anyway, bottom line is, Friends is THE best comedy sitcom on TV (along with The Simpsons), but I don't think I will be surprised or even sad if 10 is their last season, as it has to end eventually, and I think the timing is perfect. It's the best thing for F.R.I.E.N.D.S to end, it was beginning to fade in quality. But ten years for a sitcom is some achievement in any right.<br/><br/>The show in my opinion started pretty mediocre but then became easily the best comedy America has produced in many a year.<br/><br/>The characters were great and the original casting director deserves a medal for bringing these six actors together because like it or not EVERY ONE has laughed at least once!<br/><br/>I don't think there is a character I hate because I even find time for David Schwimmer's 'Ross'... Plus let's not forget the three girls are hot!<br/><br/>I will always enjoy the re-runs! Many a day I have been sad and lonely and the only thing to look forward to was "Friends" at 5:30 (in syndication).  Cute and likeable and never pretentious, the characters are fun to watch.  At times they may seem a little animated but what the heck, who wouldn't laugh at Phoebe's quick witted and sometimes innocent comments.  Friend's is a real "spirit booster" and the actors are pleasant to watch. I have watched nearly every series of friends, and particularly liked the first 5, when 6 - 9 came out i was a bit disappointed that the comedy hung on sex jokes to much, but after watching them more often i have come to like them more than the original series. The key i think is not to take it to seriously, so its completely false, and they have never done one thing that is remotely normal and they never go to work etc, it makes me laugh all the time, and in the end, as a comedy that is its purpose. I'd give it 8/10.<br/><br/>Ross & Joey are by far the best characters. Friends is the best show ever! I luv it so much I never miss an episode!Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry are my favourite actors! The writers are so good they just keep coming up with the best stuff every its always funny and original!:) I dont want friends to end! I wish it could go on forever!:) When I was about to see the show Friends for the first time two years ago, I was skeptical because my expectations were so high. All of my friends were encouraging me to see it, saying "Ohmigod, you haven't seen Friends?!", so I gave in and watched an episode.<br/><br/>I had to admit that it was definitely well written, well acted, and always had an episode of interest that a teen/adult could relate to, and unlike most sitcoms, each episode has something different and new to offer (like a guest star, etc.).<br/><br/>After one episode I was hooked, the show just draws you in, mostly because the characters are so darn cute and likable. Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Ross (David Schwimmer), Chandler (Matthew Perry), and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) are hilarious, fun, and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Each character has a certain characteristic about them such as: Monica-neurotic neat-freak, Rachel-sweetie, Chandler-smart funny, Ross-cute brainer, and Joey and Phoebe are the ditzy big kids.<br/><br/>The group of six live in New York and spend their 30-something lifestyles filled with ups and downs involving love, loss, and friendship. I think it was a smart decision to give Friends a tenth season, why end the show at the peak of its popularity? I advise anyone who hasn't seen an episode of Friends to do so, you won't be disappointed, and with ten seasons of success under the Friends' belt, you'll see why its so popular. to ThirteenthFriday. No inconveinent prenancies? What about Emma? You seem to know so much about the show but don't know about Rachel having a baby? It's not a "reality" show it's a COMEDY! People don't laugh at serious things. If you don't like the show don't watch it!! HAHA. Sorry I am upset that you think that everything has to always be realistic.<br/><br/>~Me Friends is whitout a doubt the best comedy show on TV,  nothing even cames close to being as good as "Friend".  I think they shold carry it on for many more years to came,  Why end it?  its been going for like 9 years so why not keep it going for more, people will always watch it. I Think Matthew Perry as Chandler is just classic he is my favorit on the show,  I love his sarcasum,  He is the funniest guy in the world.  But I have to say that Phabee really irritates me,  she has this really bad attitude towards chandler, like she's always downing him, I hate people like that.  Anyway I love Friends and I have every single episode on video and DVD,  I hope they never stop making them.<br/><br/>10/10 (or even more) friends started as a really good comedy show, it had funny characters that you can love easily.<br/><br/>But as they started to run out of ideas all the new incidents have nothing to do with the characters, like for e.g Joey falling in love with Rachel, or even Chandler marrying Monica.They killed all the funny parts of chandlers character when they got him married.<br/><br/>Maybe it's time to stop it , or find new good ideas.If the ideas don't run with the characters they should make a new show with new characters about them,they expect us to believe that the characters we've watched and knew for years would do what ever comes to writers minds , it should be a little consistent. Friends has been the best cable t.v. show on since it started. Like every other show they sometimes tread over the same story lines, but it is always funny and always fresh. I recently read this is the last season, and even though I am sad about that, it is good to see it lasted this long. Friends will never be replaced and I don't think NBC realizes that yet. This show has been amazing and funny and fresh since 1994.I love it! This is the first movie or TV-show i comment on IMDB.This will hopefully not be the best review.It`s not even a review,because i don`t know what to say, but i know the feelings i`m trying to express now is love.My endless love for this show and all it`s characters. Never has a TV-show made me feel so much (in this case,happiness). Movies,yes,because they go a lot deeper into human emotions,but never a TV-show.Until this one came along and i was in love.Our relationship has been going on for almost seven years now(it came to Norway a couple of years after it started in U.S.A.)and it will go on as long as the show is running,which i hope will be for a couple more seasons,and forever after that in my mind,and in my heart. This show was my life for long while but now i can live without the show. If you look back on the show the first season was average and then season 2-6 was superb but after watching season 7 i didn't even buy that season on video because of the poor quality but last year was much better and i am becoming an addict again and want the series to go into a 10th season or i will probably freak out and please let ross and rachel get together. A<br/><br/>Starring: David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, and Courtney Cox.<br/><br/>Six people (three men and three women) living in New York have funny plots unfold in their lives.  This show *was* my favorite show of all time. *But*, it fell down.  There are some unforgivable flaws that I can't seem to forget.  The characters, for example, are all slightly flawed. <br/><br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rachel, what a b*tch.  She always has to get what she wants.  I have three perfect examples.  1) Julie was Ross's love.  Ross loved her a lot, and in my opinion, they could've ended up together. But no, Rachel has to barge in the relationship and steal Ross from Julie.  2) I forgot the characters name, but Christine Taylor.  Ross was dating her and really liked her.  Then Rachel tells her to shave her head bald and steal Ross from her. 3) Emily was going to marry Ross.  Ross loved her very much.  Then Rachel goes over there to stop the wedding and makes Ross say the wrong name (and ruin the marriage).  I can't help but disliking her.<br/><br/>Monica was great.  Then she started talking and it was over.<br/><br/>Pheobe was hilarious.  Then she got ditzier and ditzier.  She's also a b*tch.  She's so mean to everyone at times.<br/><br/>Chandler was my favorite character.  His witty and sarcastic remarks made him hysterical.  Then he fell in love with Monica.<br/><br/>Ross is a geeky guy, but still funny.  Then he fell in love with Rachel.<br/><br/>Joey has very little flaws about him.  He is my favorite character. <br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>"Friends" is an excellent show, but the many flaws made it bad for me.<br/><br/>Rank: Tied in 3rd (with "Andy Richter") I am a huge fan of this TV show and it shall go down as one of the BEST TV shows on television, along with The Simpsons. The actors of Friends compliment each other so well and make the show what it is, which is entertaining and hilarious! If anyone thinks this show is stupid or pointless, then they haven't given enough time to watch the episodes from the beginning. The show can be confusing at times if you don't know what it going on. I think of this show being a modern day saved by the bell. With Rachel and Ross being Zach and Kelly. You just know they will end up together. This show was Red-Hot to me its first five or so seasons. Ever Since Monica aAnd Chandler got together the show kind of fell apart and I have lost interest in it. But it is still the best show on TV today. And I will be collecting the DVD set. i've watched each episode more than 4 times, i know every line, and it stills cracks me up. i love all the characters. i even love janice for crying out loud!! but i felt really disappointed when i watched this last season. i can honestly say that it kinda sucked. i mean... joey falling in love with rachel? whats that all about? i think thats just trying too hard. it should end already, and if it ended, i think i wouldn't be the only one to keep watching the reruns over and over.<br/><br/> but there is one thing that really bugs me. all these great seasons and not one single emmy for best comedy. and now for the worst friends season ever they get one. thats really pathetic... :( This is one of my top 5 t.v. shows in the world.  I will cry for days when it gets cancelled in 2003.  These "Friends" will always be in my heart. Joey, the womanizer and idiot; Chandler, the accountant? and funnyman; Ross, the boring and divorcee (3 times!); Pheebs, the confusing and hippie; Monica, the perfectionist and bossy; and Rachel, the love-crazy and fashion expert.  These characters will never change and will never be forgotten in my eyes and in eyes of many other people.  Bravo, Jennifer, Courtney, Lisa, Matt, Matthew, David, and the rest of the cast and crew of this great show; bravo. Friends is a wonderful show with a wonderful cast! I can't see how anybody could say anything bad about it. It is very funny and entertaining.. one of the best shows in history!! No other show can compare to Friends .. to put it simply .. it is the best. While other hit shows drive themselves into the ground after a few years, Friends gets even better as time goes by. Another great thing about this show is that the cast is WONDERFUL. The cast couldn't have been chosen better. To put it into three words .. Everybody needs "Friends"!! Friends is one of those shows that will always be around.  Years from now, we'll be watching it on Nick at Nite, then TV Land...yes, it's one of those lifelong Friends that you never have to worry about losing.<br/><br/>What makes this show work is the chemistry between the characters and the actors who play them.  Sure,  the one liners, plots, and jokes are great, but it wouldn't be the same if there wasn't chemistry. Courteney Cox-Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc work together so well, so fluently, and so convincingly, that you start to really care about the characters.  Their quirky habits walk the line between charming and annoying, but come out so much more charming because they're so relatable.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Green.  Out of all the characters, I'd say she's changed the most.  We saw her go from a prissy rich girl who just left a man at the altar and painfully cutting up her credit cards to a successful, confident, independent woman.  Plus, she's got some great hair! ;) Courteney Cox-Arquette plays a formerly fat Monica Gellar, Ross' (Schwimmer) sister and now, Chandler's wife.  She's a neat freak if there ever was one, and that's where many of her laughs come from.  Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay (my personal fave), a ditzy but lovable folk singer and massuse.  Her songs are hilarious (who can forget Smelly Cat?).  David Schwimmer plays Ross- Monica's brother and the father of Rachel's baby (Emma).  I feel he's been overlooked in the cast.  He's a little geeky, a little dorky, but you've gotta love him.  He's had three [failed] marriages (first wife- a lesbian, second- accidently said Rachel's name at the alter, thrid- he and Rachel got drunk in Vegas and eloped).  He and Rachel have been the on again-off again- on a break couple of the show, and fans are rooting for them to be the next couple.  Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing. His one liners are classic, and his sarcasm is hilarious.  (Could he BE any funnier?)  Matt LeBlanc is the aspiring (emphasize that word!) actor, who, like Phoebe, is a little ditzy and quite the womanizer. ;)<br/><br/>
Friends has been able to take the usual sitcom plot and liven it up to make it something new and exciting, as well as come up with many plot twists and storylines of their own.  I'll let you know if I EVER see a bad episode of Friends.  Until then, sit down, turn on your TV, eat some popcorn and enjoy Friends. This show may have some weak points (Ross' whining, season eight), but it is still my favorite show. I really didn't like season eight too much because it was so much of a soap opera. And since when did Monica get to be such a clean freak type person? I think it may have happened as soon as everyone found out she was dating Chandler. BTW, does anyone else think they aren't a very good couple? It may just be me, but they seem a little mismatched.<br/><br/>Still, I like this show. It has just the right amount of strange humor to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>Thanks What would we do next year without our weekly dose of Friends? For the past 9 years Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Phoebe have become our life and a huge part of us all will be missing when the show comes to an end next year.<br/><br/>Everyone is brilliant in their roles but the standouts are definitely Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer, the others are great but Jennifer and David really shine every year in their roles as Rachel and Ross.<br/><br/>I know i'm going to be upset come May next year when the series ends but at least I have my collection so I can watch my Friends whenever I want. This is a really excellent television show.  It's only behind Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  It is still awesome.  Almost all episodes are excellent and all the characters personalities (Monica's cleanliness, Chandler's sarcasm, Phoebe's stupidity) are all really played out well.  the characters are really cool and the cliffhangers at the end of each season is really awesome.<br/><br/>Overall the whole series is excellent and it is ending in one year, sadly. Rating **** out of ****. (2nd Best TV Show) Ok, all the people who said the show is stupid are stupid. I HAVE FRIENDS LIKE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU SAY STUFF ABOUT THEM YOU AREN'T JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE ON THE SHOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ALOT OF THIS COUNTRY! Besides if you hate it sooo much why do you watch it??? What ya'll need to do is get a life. In case you didn't know this is like America's number #1 show and instead of commenting on how stupid it is comment on the shows you do like! What would the world be like if every show was completely realist??? That would be way too scary! So if ya don't like a show don't watch it! By the way Friends rocks and I'm sorry to see it's ending!<br/><br/>Your 13 Year Old Friend, Hermione ...go to the library and check out a book of Restoration Comedy--late 1600s-ish.  You can be sure that Crane and Kaufman ate this stuff up while in college and probably look it over even now to keep fresh.<br/><br/>The situations?  People going thru all sorts of tricks and scams in the name of love; parents making fun of their kids, kids making fun of the parents; guys trying to figure out how to break up with girls, true lovers stumbling along to marriage...sound familiar?  Already covered by Etheredge, Wycherly, and Congreve. And very wittily, too.<br/><br/>I love "Friends".  I watch the episodes over and over and still get a kick out of it.  I love Restoration Comedy, too, and I think it is because it and "Friends" are so similar. Like I said, I enjoy watching Friends.  It's one of the few sitcoms that I can watch these days.  But now, from a recent episode, it appears as though NBC may trying to turn back the clock.<br/><br/>From a recent episode, Rachel turned thirty years old, yet it was my impression that these people had turned thirty a few years ago.  It almost appears as though NBC may be trying to turn back the clock to keep the show's younger audience interested, when in fact the majority of the actors are in their mid- to later-thirties.<br/><br/>I will continue watching the show because I still find it to be quite funny, but I do not like it when these "higher powers" begin to re-write the show and change the "facts" just to keep their ratings up. This show never succeed in Portugal because it was the first attempt to dub a series to Portuguese (I guess we're fortunately the only country in the world that does not spoil the fine work of an actor by badly dubbing him/her and thus taking out one of the most significant characteristic of them: the VOICE!!!!) Imagine that! France, Spain, Germany, Brazil, etc. never heard the voices of Woody Allen, Humphrey Bogart or Marilyn Monroe. Can you believe it? So, I hated Friends as well as every viewer in this country. But fortunately, a friend of mine bought it recently on DVD. And I saw, for now, the first FOUR seasons of the show in its original voices. And I ADORE THE SHOW!!! What people viewed in four years, I did in three months. So, I started looking for some comments here on IMDB about his success. For my amazement, I felt revolted when I found that some commentators didn't write the word SPOILERS in their comments. PLEASE, I didn't need to know, now, that *SPOILERS DON'T READ* Ross got married thrice! OH...MY...GOD... I didn't like this show when it first came out. I think it has gotten a lot funnier though. I started liking it around 1996 or 1997 and haven't missed an episode since. I don't care what anyone says, Courtney Cox is the best one. Her character is just so funny and the one I relate to the most. I'm tired of Jennifer Aniston getting all the nominations and if it isn't her it's Lida Kudrow, when does Courtney get her turn?? She is most deserving. This show is just the funniest show ever! All the actors are amazing and they make their characters so real that you just can't help falling in love with them and take them for what they are- for better and for worst. Start watching and it is certain you won't be able to stop! If there were a sitcom hall of fame then "F.R.I.E.N.D.S." would defintly have a spot beside the other greats like:Happy days,Married with children and The Simpsons.What is so brilliant about this show is that it has no limit it has stuff like homosexuality discussed in it and it was one of the first series' to feature the word "Vagina". It follows the life of six young people RACHEL GREEN is a woman who ran out on her husband at the altar ROSS GELLER is a man who has divorced three woman on the first marriage that lasted seven years his wife turned out to be gay on the second one he said the wrong name at the altar and in the third one he was drunk in vegas and married rachel they were also a couple in season two and three but broke up ross has a son named ben and is the brother of monica geller MONICA GELLER is a cook who was really really fat when she was a teenager but lost weight so she could get a man's attention and the man accidently lost his toe because of all that monica is now engaged to that man and that man is- CHANDLER BING the sarcastic member of the show his parent's broke up when he was only nine which caused chandler to start smoking but he stopped PHOEBE BOUFFAY is the magical member of the group she was also married(To a gay ice skater) JOEY TRIBBIONI is the rather dim member of the group he is an actor and it takes him just a shower to get over a relationship And this series wich is on it's seventh season is about these people and their attempt to survive in the real world... When I was young (and still living in LA) I liked shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie (which I still love). I also liked all those animated cartoons (Which I now don't, with the exception of those made for more mature audiences such as Daria and Dilbert). But the first ever show in my mature life that I LOVED was Friends. I first got into it when all the 'grown-ups' of my family one night watched Friends and Seinfeld. I wasn't too impressed with Seinfeld (which I now love as mush as Friends) but I did love Friends. Seinfeld is hilariously funny but the jokes are more sophisticated and can be understood much more by adults or teenagers than young kids. Friends (whilst having it's share of sex and political jokes) can be liked by kids of younger ages as a lot of jokes are simpler or more visual. I still get a kick of watching all the old episodes I watched when I was young, I didn't understand so many jokes then or mistook them for other meanings and I now go "Of course! How could I have missed that?".<br/><br/>
The cast is great. I don't know why so many people keep attacking Monica, I actually like her a lot. My favorite character no doubt has to be Phoebe (played by the hilarious Lisa Kudrow, who could have potential movie talent which she wasted on movies with no potential but she is climbing up since Analyze This). Phoebe is the very zany, spiritual, not very knowledgeable woman who can also remember stuff from her past lives. Chandler (played by Matthew Perry, who like Lisa did stupid movies until The Whole Nine Yards proved to be funny and successful) is the cynical, sarcastic guy who makes most inside jokes and whose job is a mystery to all. Monica (played by Courteney Cox, now with the addition of Arquette to the name. Courteney probably proved to be most successful on the big screen with the Scream trilogy) is the cleaning-freak, tidy, neurotic of the gang. Chandler and Monica make a great couple. Joey (played by Matt LeBlanc whose only movie worth mentioning is Lost in Space) is the dumbest guy in the group (every group has one). Rachel (played by Jennifer Aniston, who's movies are all rather stupid and is now married to Brad Pitt) is the spoiled one from the rich background who loves shopping. Ross (played by David Schwimmer, who has made some pretty stupid movies, including one he made with his Israeli actress wife, Mili Avital) is the geeky scientist guy who has been married three times- four years to the mother of his child who turned out to be a lesbian, for a split second with Emily, who oops instead of saying her name at the ceremony said Rachel's'- who he married out of drunkenness in Vegas.<br/><br/>
Friends is not as funny as it was in the first four seasons but it is still very enjoyable and worth watching. Ross and Rachel are kinda getting on my nerves always leading us to believe they're on again, then off. And Ross is just getting way too whiny. But I love Friends, and I don't see how anybody can hate it- these are just anti people. Friends is un-hatable, you may not like it, but I don't see how you can hate it. This is my all-time favorite t.v. show ever.  My second favorite is "Newsradio", which is also great, but it doesn't come close to matching this.  If they would release them on video here in the U.S.A., I would buy every episode.  I envy the British who have every episode on tape (including even the most recent) and all but the latest season on DVD.  It's a great show, and I think it's better than Seinfeld, which is pretty much responsible for it's popularity.  Speaking of Seinfeld, I wish they'd release all those episodes on DVD, too, ala X-Files. I love Friends. It is such a good show. My favorite character is Rachel. I think that Rachel and Ross should get back together because they were so cute together. When Bruce Willis guest starred it was funny. Monica and Chandler also make a really good couple. I've been watching this show since it's debut in 1994 and it is surely one of the best shows I hav ever seen. congratulations on it's nomination for best comedy series and to Jennifer Aniston (Rachel) and Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe) who got nominated for best supporting actress in a comedy. Keep up the good work! Friends is really the best comedy on the net, next to the british Men Behaving badly. OK I admit they have their weak episodes and there also was a season I didn't like that much, but that can happen. Overall very good, I especially like Ross (the museum nerd), Chandler (the gay-like weirdo) and Rachel (kind of a stuck up spoilt person). The other three are not bad either, but they are more standard in their jokes and don't surprise me as much as the others and they don't make me laugh as much.<br/><br/>
If I'd have to rate it i'd give it an 8 out of 10 I loved Friends during its initial four seasons. The actors were brilliant. The writing was perfect and true to the show's premise. It was the best comedy of the 90's.<br/><br/>Unfortunately these last two seasons were completely messed up. With Seinfeld's departure, Friends became more of a Seinfeld than a standout comedy about young people attempting to live their lives independently.<br/><br/>I no longer like Phoebe. She was fantastic from the Pilot to her giving birth to her brother's triplets. But afterwards, she became a stupid character, unfriendly, selfish. It's not the free-spirited Phoebe I once knew and loved.<br/><br/>These six young people no longer act like Friends. The writing changed completely. What happened to Ross & Rachel? When did Rachel stop loving Ross? We never see Ross's son anymore. Monica & Chandler are the most boring couple I've ever seen. We hardly see them together. They don't have any chemistry like Ross & Rachel had.<br/><br/>The stories used to be dramatic and character-based. They grew and learned from their actions. Recently, there's been no dramatic development on Friends. Instead, awful episodes like the Unagi episode (which doesn't make any sense in the overall storyline) went on air.<br/><br/>I hope Friends gets back on track next season developing its characters in realistic ways as it used to. I want this show back to the glory it was held for four seasons, instead of becoming another dumb sitcom of the 90's like Seinfeld. I have to admit that I was not a fan of Friends at all until very recently. The show first debuted in 1994, and at that time, I was still bemoaning the loss of Saved by the Bell, the show that I had watched all throughout my formative years.  Quite frankly, Friends didn't strike my fancy at all.  I began watching Friends periodically in the Spring 1998, but a busy schedule forced me to put the show on hiatus until late last year.  Now, after having caught up on virtually every single episode, I am hopelessly HOOKED. Friends has become a part of my daily schedule (hey, re-runs are not all bad, LOL), just as Jeopardy was, and is.  The storylines are clever and witty, and the manner in which the producers have chosen to title each episode suggests a certain creativity and boldness that, to my knowledge, has never been tested before.<br/><br/>As far as the six characters go, they are, in my opinion, mutually complementary; that is, that it is the group dynamics that give the characters their charm and appeal because admittedly, it would be very unlikely that I would be able to last 10 minutes alone with any one of the characters.  (I suppose, however, that that is the way it is with most television shows.)  While some of the characters appear to be notoriously indolent, the lives that they live are gloriously appealing.  Fun, fluffy bunny games is what their lives are all about, and I would be incredibly thrilled if I didn't have to continuously fret over the pettiness that encompasses my existence! Why is it that people continue to watch "Friends" with a never--dying adoration? That is a simple question to answer. It only gets funnier, sexier, and more entertaining with age (unlike most shows on the television). The six main actors and actresses are all talented and interesting; they have managed to create their characters in a way that makes them feel real to the viewer. All of us can relate to one (or all) of the characters on some level. Rachel, Monica, Joey, Chandler, Ross, and Phoebe will live on even after the show inevitably goes off the air. :-) Friends is one of the best written, funniest sitcoms today and possibly of all time. It is definitely a show that will be remember 20 years from now like "Bewitched" and "Three's Company".<br/><br/>Each star, Jennifer Aniston (Rachel), Courteney Cox (Monica), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe), Matt LeBlanc (Joey), Matthew Perry (Chandler) and David Schwimmer (Ross) adds their own good acting skills and bring their characters greatly to life. You can relate to their neurotic behavior and situations and you feel like you can really be friends with these people.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Chandler, his dry and sarcastic and neurotic personality and great stage presence from Matthew Perry makes this character one of the most unforgettable, and I have to say that Phoebe is well after him. The new and hottest storyline, Chandler and Monica keeps the show fresh and adds great new comic situations. If you haven't seen Friends, I'm pretty sure that you will love it! 'Friends' has always been, and most likely always will be, my favorite show of all time.  It's one of the very few shows that has been consistently funny all over the years.<br/><br/>What I also love about this show is its ability to portray hilarity one minute, and then the next, complicated emotional issues right to-the-point. With excellent scripts, and fine, precise acting, 'Friends' is about as good as it gets.<br/><br/>I, personally, hope the show will last for years from now...but all good things do eventually come to an end.  But, I know I'll never forget the laughter, tears, and fun I shared with Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Joey, Rachel, and Ross. This is the funniest tv-comedy ever made. I can`t come up with anything worth to criticize. If I have a bad day, i just throw in a tape with Friends in my VCR and just relax and laugh as hell.<br/><br/>The best thing must be when Chandler and Monica got together, i almost swallowed my tongue when Monica showed her face in Chandler's bed the night in London, excellent!! The only thing that`s missing is of course Phoebe and Joey to get together, don`t you think? I do!!<br/><br/>And a big star to the writers to come up with all these jokes, not a single boring one. And one to Matthew Perry, his way to say "S" is so great. Or what about the way he say all his meanings with one marked word. And his humour in private, almost the same have i heard. A person with bigger humour is hard to get! And of course, one big star to David Schwimmer who has being married to Natalie Imbruglia.<br/><br/>"Friends is not a tv-comedy that you like or dislike, it`s something you hate or love." I can't go a week without watching "Friends". After 5 seasons, it's in the number 1 spot! What gets you hooked at first is the humor, but after a while we become attached to the characters and their lives. I'd recommend it to anyone- I love it, my gramma loves it, my boyfriend loves it, and practically all of my friends love it! Anyone who seriously dislikes "Friends" either hasn't seen enough of it or is simply determined not to like it. It may be hard to understand exactly why we love it so much, but it's not hard to see why it's number 1! This show is my favorite of all time! I think that friends is a great show with a very smart humor and the cast is great. I think that Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow are the best. Running in its 8th season Friends is now better than ever. An average of almost 30 million viewers (in America only) tune in to Friends every Thursday evening. Why you ask?<br/><br/>Because Friends has a quality that only a few sit-coms in history has possessed; Universal humor mixed with a gang of sweet, relatable characters portrayed by 6 great actors. Everybody in their right mind would want Friends like these! And why, you ask again?<br/><br/>Because these Friends are extremely entertaining, funny, good-lookin' (without being glamorous) but most of all because these Friends are there for you when it really counts.<br/><br/>What makes this sit-com stand out from all the rest (besides all of the above-mentioned!) is a strong crew of writers, producers and directors. Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin S. Bright - the original creators/executive producers of Friends - have done a great job putting everything together.<br/><br/>The writing stays fresh, the jokes stays funny, the acting stays outstanding, and the result stays undeniably great! Every time I watch F*R*I*E*N*D*S I get this good feeling inside. Like this show makes me feel good. It's hilarious. A knockout. David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox Arquette, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston & Lisa Kudrow make a GRRRRRRRRRREAT team! Also one thing I'd like to add Monday - Friday 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm on FOX. Saturday 3:30 pm on TBSSuperstation. Sunday 6:00 on FOX. Oh, yeah the new ones come on Thursdays at 8:00 on NBC3. Those were the F*R*I*E*N*D*S showtimes. If you like soap operas & comedies watch the new episodes (Thursday at 8:00 pm on NBC3) This show is so great.<br/><br/>My favorite episodes would have to be "The One Where Ross (David Schwimmer) gets with Janice, The One Where Janice cheats on Chandler, (Matthew Perry)The One Where Joey (Matt LeBlanc) gets nominated for a Soapie for his part on "DAYS OF OUR LIVES." I actually can't say all mine because if I did I would have to mention every episode.<br/><br/>P.S. F*R*I*E*N*D*S is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this show sooooooo much. all of the characters are likable Chandler is funny Joey is sweet Pheobe is mentel Rachel is funny Monica is Funny Ross is Childish Every minite of this show has something funny in it. Something amazing about Friends -- you can only watch each episode once (if that) because they immediately cease to be funny whenever you see a rerun.<br/><br/>
Once you get past that they have no minority friends or even OTHER friends (though when it's time to throw a party they can find enough people to fill their apartment), the 6 dorks are still annoying. They are immature, selfish and dumb. Sure, that was also true on Seinfeld, but that show REVELED in all that, you loved watching them but you weren't supposed to love THEM. Friends is like product hyper-placement, you are supposed to want to be like them and buy all the stuff they have. Ricky Ricardo on "I Love Lucy" owned his own NYC nightclub and couldn't afford all the stuff these 6 idiots have.<br/><br/>
Essentially, this show is about the actors' hair and that's it. I am glad they're canceling it, it's just old. In 20 years we'll look at it the way we regard "Bosom Buddies" today. Ok, this is the best show ever, really it is. Every time I watch "Friends" I just think to myself: "Gosh, can it possibly get any better, funnier...more perfect? It's just so perfect, almost too perfect!" Most importantly, it also made me realize that you can't live without your "Friends" :-) If I had to decide the salary for the friends cast based on their worth it would go like this: Chandler  - a million dollars, Rachel - $500,000, Phoebe-$250,000,Joey- $200,000. Monica-$200,000, Ross - 5c.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the show is chandler played by the brilliant brilliant Matthew Perry. All the other characters are just plain annoying. I have got to the stage where I watch Chandler's parts and go and make a cup of coffee while everyone else is on. However in season 8, my cup of coffee visits are getting more and more. Where is Chandler???!!! The poor man is barely on! A plea to the writers: Do not under-use the best thing you have and overuse the worst thing in Ross. and another thing - when you have one cast member dressed as a potato and another dressed as a pink bunny rabbit hitting each other with a carrot, then this kind of smacks of desperation in my mind.<br/><br/>In order to make the show great again then we need chandler and joey scenes back, Monica to stop being such a complete b**** to her husband  - have C&M act like a married couple as opposed to two people who seemingly met for the first time last week, just more Chandler scenes, and Ross to emigrate. Apart from that its a great show!! 'Friends' is prehaps the greatest TV show of the late 1990s.  No Show has kept me so involved with the characters and had so many correlations with my own life and so many other of my own friends.  While some of the stories might be a little unrealistic at times, the bond between the characters never deviates from how real life friends interact with each other.  They are critical of their friends behavior and actions,  & they might not always agree with each other, but they still stick together for better or worse. You might say that its only a TV show, but the few genuine true firends that I have follow the same patterns. Friends is such a cool show!  I mean, I don't think the plots are realistic though.  And the characters aren't realistic either.  But watching Friends kinda makes you escape from reality and into their world.  It's just hilarious.  All the actors uses great and realistic ezpressions.  And it's fun watching them act like idiots.  I mean, Rachel is all miss prissy, so it's just fun watching her acting like a spoil brat.  Watching Pheobe act like a retarded freak kinda cracks me up.  Monica reminds me of my mom. Joey talks a lil too much bout sex though.  Chandler's the best cuz of, well, he KNOWS how to act.  I just think Friends is the koolest show out there and ne body can watch it and have fun (well, some contents might be unappropriate for ppl under 13..) I love this show. At first I didn`t know why but now I do. This is such a rip-off of "Saved by the Bell." It`s the same show but different. For example Ross and Rachel.<br/><br/>*Ross and Rachel on and off.<br/><br/>-Zack and Kelly on and off.<br/><br/>*Ross and Rachel get married in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>-Zack and Kelly get married in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Obviously the inspiration for this show came from "Saved by the Bell." It`s even on NBC. "Saved by the Bell" was on NBC. As a matter of fact this show premiered a year after SBTB ended. This show is like SBTB after High School. That`s why many-including myself-like this program. The only difference between this show and SBTB is that "Friends" has no black people. It`s just like "Star Trek". Friends is the best show ever! I wish it never had to end!! Ok and what is with these people saying that's its bad and unrealistic?! I hate people like that,if you can't just sit and enjoy a comedy then why watch it at all? This show is and always will be the best sitcom there ever was. And the cast could not be better! They all play the characters very well. They are all funny and good-looking. Why does everyone hate david swchimmer? I think he's a good actor anyway. All you people who don't like this show obviously have no sense of humor! I haven't watched this show for as long as it's been on.  I much prefer the older episodes, where Joey is a hot stud (THAT hasn't changed!) but he seems to have a brain on him.  I think they've taken a turn for the worst by making him seem all out stupid.  All the characters seem to have more flaws coming out with time.  I've started watching it again and putting aside my distaste for the dorkiness of the characters. Although I admit I enjoy seeing Friends, I've got a problem with post-production and the backing laughs, which many times come on when nothing funny has actually been said. Can't the staff do better and keep them in a low profile or just drop them? Anyway, this is a problem common to all sitcoms.<br/><br/>As other people have commented here, it's time to put an end to Friends. Why? Simple. The cast is not in their late-twenties anymore and is getting OUTRAGEOUS amounts of money for what they do. Add to this the fact that the writers seem to have squeezed their brains dry looking for decent plots and these are getting dull and weak. For instance, why did they need to bring Winona Ryder to kiss Jennifer Aniston? Was that intended to gain some audience who prefers "Survivor"? If a sitcom gets to the point of including a lesbian kiss to attract potential viewers it only proves the show is running out of ideas.<br/><br/>Eight years is too much time for any TV show, so the smartest decision (In artistic terms, of course) would be to call it quits now, before Friends dies from lack of inspiration and greed from the actors. Many sitcoms have made the same mistake before: going on and on until becoming rubbish, and sadly that's how they're remembered (Seinfeld comes to mind).<br/><br/>It's actually curious how little success most of the Friends cast has achieved elsewhere. Maybe Courtney Cox has been the luckiest one, in lousy horror movies like Scream, but most of the rest haven't been very wise choosing acting roles in movies (At least regarding quality).<br/><br/>Friends first season was weak and little funny. The second season was better, so they were the third and the fourth, and the fifth was the best season ever, probably due to the Chandler/Monica secret affair. Even after being discovered by their pals (Hysterical that episode, as a matter of fact) kept being amusing. Early series 6 lived up to expectations, but was slowly losing interest. I can't say a lot about the seventh season, since I live in a country where it hasn't been aired yet but (According to people who have seen it), the downhill slide has continued. And now they're about to start series 8. I wonder what the writers will come up with, after the wedding. Are they planning to make the still single foursome tie the knot as well? Who knows?<br/><br/>One may complain that Friends is a show full of cute faces and that is not realistic (Even I say that myself), but the problem is that's what the bulk of the audience wants to see, whether we like it or not.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10. I've pretty much seen every epposode!  My friends and I all have the "Best of Friends" DVD's and VHS!  The cast is perfect for the roles!  It show's what life really is w/o putting fake things that never happen!  Things like sleeping with your best friend then falling inlove with him and marrying him.  Also things like have three devorces and only being 30!!  Watch this show!  It's great! This is not just a situation comedy this is how life should be...there is a perfect mix of little dramas and of the wittiest scripts I've ever came across. Furthermore the cast is so cool you can't but love them THE BEST PIECE OF TV COMEDY EVER Well no doubt that this show is hilarious but the actors of the show have a very good chemistry between them and this is the main reason for the success of the show.This is very important because the actors have a mutual understanding amongst themselves and this is the reason why they perform their roles so well! In my mind this is one series that will never loose the spark to attract audiences all the time. At the beginning I felt that the story lines were a bit boring and a tad tedious. The basic story line is about 6 friends Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross who lead ordinary lives until Rachel comes back to New York and finds Monica after leaving the alter. After this the story line continues. (He falls in love with her and so on). Through out the whole running length of 'Friends' the plots do get much better and nearly all the time, after the fighting and the arguments, the episode has a happy ending!! If you enjoy laughing at 6 people who are trying to survive being single in a hard world then I personally recommend this for you. I have nothing left to say apart from ENJOY!!!! "Friends" is my favorite sitcom and has been since it aired in 1994. I love each and every one of the 6 friends. I feel like I know them and that they are *my* friends. They are funny and lovable and every episode is fun to watch. I watch about 4 episodes a day (we have plenty of re-runs) and I never miss any! I know them all by heart because they are so funny and touching. The show has lasted this long, I believe, thanks to the great relationship among the members of the cast offstage. It is very important and it is clearly shown through their acting. it's true - the last two seasons have been a bit less funny than the previous ones - but they still are funny and very fun to watch! I hope this show is never canceled! i believe that friends has to be the best tv sitcom on television. we can so easily relate to what is going on and actually in and indirect way be able to deal with our own problems through their solutions.  not only is it helpful that way, its also a funny comedy show.  there is never a boring moment and the writers and actors always leave us wanting more.  i would have to say that they picked the greatest actors that they could have. mattew perry for one is a terrific actor.  he has so much talent and is so funny.
