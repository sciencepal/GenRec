Seriously though. Best show currently on television. 
At first, I thought it was another cartoon for adults only with poor drawings. But it's not. It's different.
For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. 
It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes and that feels good. 
Also, this show may be one of the depictions of depression on TV and movies ever. At a glance, this show looks like your run of the mill wacky, raunchy adult cartoon comedy. And yes, it has plenty of that with the titular character's rude and obscene behavior, and a saturated slew of animal puns. There are wacky characters and absurd plots to be sure, but all of that eventually takes a backseat to the fact that Bojack Horseman is, at heart, a nuanced and overtly depressing show about pain and self-loathing.<br/><br/>This season really has more in common with Jody Hill's Eastbound and Down than it does any of the cartoons it's often being compared to, not just in the sense that it's a dark character study but also in the aspect that it's not episodic at all. Continuity plays a huge role in the show, and many of the episodes start exactly where the last one left off (evidence that the writers were catering to the "binging" crowd). A lot of the funniest jokes come from references to past episodes (such as the wonderful moment where Bojack assumes that on his last drinking binge he must have become obsessed with David Boreanaz for some reason.) As depressing and serious as the shows ultimate arc really is, the absurdist icing that comes from immersion in this world where anthropomorphic animals are taken for granted helps make this bitter pill an enjoyable meal. Great comedic performances from Amy Sedaris, Paul F. Tompkins, and Aaron Paul don't hurt either. But overall, Bojack Horseman is a thoughtful, witty feel-bad comedy in the best way. Listen here, I am going to be the most straight up and ask myself these questions, and try to answer them: What is Bojack Horseman?<br/><br/>What does it mean?<br/><br/>What does it try to reflect?<br/><br/>Why does it feel so real?<br/><br/>I'll tell you in one word: because it is REAL. As real can get..<br/><br/>It's every miserable dark corner of everyone's life that all of us is just too upset or tiny to talk about. It is the real real, showing every ugly and every petty, showing that we are just a piece of dust in this universe which is billions of years older than us, that we are meaningless and mostly little nothings, but we all want to be worth something...<br/><br/>It is made as an animated 'cartoon' in which animals are like people, dumb jokes top even dumber jokes and it is goofy, but just to get the inner child out of you to keep you hooked, but if you are left believing that its just a goofy dumb show, then it is not for you and please leave it alone..it is life, human nature, a never ending art. And for you others, brothers, we are all Bojack Horseman's and you just need to let it go..try not to think about it. Live your life, be happy with stupid stuff, maybe find the love of your life.. just stay happy and loyal to the most importants. I love you:) And for the creators and masterminds behind the show, thank you so so much, you have my full attention, you answered a lot of questions that I could never find the answers for.. just thank you:) I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.<br/><br/>It's hard to put into words the way I felt about watching BoJack Horseman. Sure, it starts out as a comedy with seemingly no real plot. Sometimes it just seems stupid, yet still comes off as possibly a new, interesting yet also run-of-the-mill animated series, but it starts to develop into something more. Something that I think a lot of people may or may not fully see to the end of the first season because they decided the show wasn't for them. And that might still be true. But I can't help but feel some form of disappointment. Why? I don't really know. I guess I just foolishly want everyone to get something out of it.<br/><br/>I don't think anything, whether it's a book, a movie, a game, or even a show deserves a 10. But sometimes, for just a brief instant, you stop caring about how you want to quantify how much you like something and just want to express how much you enjoyed it. That to me is the only way I can really describe BoJack Horseman. I can't say it's good, or bad, or even average. It's just a show that wants to get its point across, whether it's original or not. And it does it in a way that's hard to look at critically.<br/><br/>And at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting everything I've already tried to say, I almost don't want the show to have a new season. Not because I hate it or think it's "too good" to continue on, but because it already feels complete. I obviously don't feel bad that the series has already been renewed for a second season. And even if it happened to only be a two season series, I'd still be thrilled. It's just that in some way, I hope it doesn't change.<br/><br/>So even though most likely no one will be reading this review (which is actually more like a reflection of how I felt about the show rather than a genuine examination), I at least hope that more people will try watching it and get some enjoyment out of it. Even if it's only for one episode. Who knows? I might even look back at it and wonder what I was thinking, or why I wrote a frankly pointless review about it.<br/><br/>But that's alright. Because in the moment, it was something memorable. BoJack Horseman is what modern Family Guy wishes it could be and then some; it's a black-comedy-drama show that looks into the life of a washed up television actor who's struggling to find happiness in his life and ultimately remains unsuccessful in achieving that. Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.<br/><br/>I love this show. I can hardly fault it for anything besides the initially-slow premiere episodes, which I still reckon are great entertainment in and of themselves. This is a show that rewards your patience and loyalty to it ten-fold.<br/><br/>Netflix's animation achievement gets 5/5 stars. One of the best and most emotional episodes ive ever seen in a tv show. This is a masterpiece, this is an experience. Five seasons in, "BoJack Horseman" continues to be one of the most complex, thought-provoking and funny animated shows.<br/><br/>Season five revolves around BoJack's (Will Arnett) new crime show "Philbert", and blossoming relationship with co-star Gina ("Brooklyn Nine-Nine's" Stephanie Beatriz). Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) juggles a busy producing career and the prospect of becoming a new mother, there's the fallout from Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutter's divorce, and Todd (the always amazing Aaron Paul) somehow becomes CEO of a big corporation - before being superseded by his home-made sex robot Henry Fondle (whose pre-programmed phrases provides the answers that his employees want). In an often heavy show, Todd's levity and crazy hijinks provide vital balance as well as the clever sight gags that's become a tradition.<br/><br/>The highlight of season five is 'Free Churro'; it's a 25-minute monologue by BoJack at his mother's funeral. In these 25 minutes, BoJack's complex relationship with his mother unravels, from her final words to him and the random act of kindness to BoJack from a fast food employee. Watching one person talk for 25 minutes flies against the short attention span of most viewers, but it works and Arnett should get some sort of award for it.
While season five continues to expose BoJack's many flaws (and constant self-loathing), it ends on an optimistic note, thanks to some help from Diane.<br/><br/>A must-watch for BoJack fans. Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise. <br/><br/>It does not take long at all to get wrapped up in the story of BoJack, a has-been actor known for his role as a single dad in a popular early '90s sitcom. Having not acted in the 18 years since the show was canceled, he agrees to pen a memoir in an effort to relaunch his career. When confronted with the reality of how he is perceived by others, BoJack becomes desperate for acceptance and redemption from both the public and his inner circle. <br/><br/>For the most part, people from normal walks of life are portrayed as humans, while the elite class like actors and their agents are portrayed as animals. It's a surprisingly effective method to humanize these characters to whom the common person does not easily relate. Will Arnett, Kristen Schaaf, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris all give their characters a 3-dimensional quality that is difficult to achieve in a 2D platform like animation. It helps that it is wonderfully drawn, with many subtleties that reinforce each character's persona.<br/><br/>Instead of a loosely assembled pile of anecdotal stories with characters that are just given a reason to exist, all the events during each episode contribute to the progress of the plot over the course of the first season. With episodes picking up exactly where the last one left off, the show feels more like a 3-act mini series than a TV show. That said, there are plenty of crass jokes and innuendo that will satisfy viewers who are not vested in the overall story. <br/><br/>I am delighted that the series has been picked up for a second season and to see in what direction the story of BoJack and his inner circle takes us. Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, "adult" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series "BoJack Horseman" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, "BoJack Horseman" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come. Okay, I know there are not much Bojack fans around here. I even tried recommending this show to a lot of my close friends. But they couldn't make it past few episodes. Well the answer to that is, even the actors mentioned during various interviews, that you gotta binge watch this show. I binged it like crazy and I was left with nothing but emotional hollowness all around me. Every ending of an episode led me to contemplate about life. And then there were episodes which made me go all teary eyed. All the people who loved this show is because deep down all of us are Bojack Horseman.. Someone please give this show a Golden GLobe!! Now that the show is over, I need to shout a big thank you to the it and all the people that made it happen.
Just, just that.<br/><br/>
Thank you. While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed. <br/><br/>I can't even put my thoughts into words for this review because I love this show so much, which is very surprising, I try to stay as formal as possible. I won't spoil anything, but there was a few different episodes in the past 2 seasons that made me cry, scream, hate, love, everything. This is really one of the few animated shows I can think of that brings on pure, unaltered moments of absolute emotion from the deep dark places of my soul. I connected in ways I never would have thought possible to Bojack, as well as a few other characters in the show. This is a must watch for anybody and everybody, you just have to get past the first half of the first season to truly start to love it.<br/><br/>Oh, and the show is also outstandingly funny. Worthwhile as a comedy alone. The thing with BoJack Horseman is that it takes a couple of episodes to find its stride and those first couple of episodes have caused many a person to stop watching. It's a shame, because it ends up being really great, with moments that are poignant and sad and really sort of grab you in a way you don't expect. <br/><br/>Every actor is terrific, the animation is good, it's just an all around great show. It's not quite quite Archer, but then what is, you know? I loved this and ended up watching the entire series in one sitting which is a shame because I have nothing to look forward to until / if they go for a second season. Bojack Horseman<br/><br/>Lately, the streaming service Netflix has been putting out some popular original television shows. Netflix's latest original series is BoJack Horseman, a comedic adult cartoon chronicling the life of a horse-man of the same name. Unlike many other adult cartoons, BoJack Horseman has a very complex and clever plot that spans across an entire season.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The main character of the series is a horse-man named, well, Bojack Horseman. Obviously. Bojack is a washed up actor who starred in a popular 90's sitcom called "Horsin' Around." The show takes place in Hollywood twenty years after Horsin' Around's cancellation, when Bojack is both depressed and an alcoholic. The first season is about BoJack trying to publish a memoir.<br/><br/>Bojack is not the only animal-man in the show. In fact, the series contains a fair amount of bestiality. There are many human and animal couples in the show. However, Bojack Horseman uses the cross species relationships in interestingly funny ways. Actually, that's how I would describe the entire show: interestingly funny. <br/><br/>BoJack Horseman isn't a show for stupid people. That is to say, many of the best jokes are nonchalantly delivered and can be hard to pick up on. Don't get me wrong, there are a fair share of blatantly stupid "jokes" is the show, just like in any adult cartoon. Still, I found myself constantly rewinding to make sure I picked up on every joke. <br/><br/>There are a couple of plot devices that I think BoJack Horseman uses very well, such as:<br/><br/>The show makes references to real life actors, people, businesses, and cities. Everything that exists in our world exists in their world. Except for the movie Secretariat. All the directors from real life have been turned into animals. Ex: Quentin Tarantualtino. Instead of each episode being its own individual story, every event carries over into future episode, even some incredibly minor details are included in later episodes. Thus, the show is filled with many "running jokes." Sometimes items in the background will randomly change.<br/><br/>There are lots of other things that make BoJack Horseman's plot so great, but all you need to know is that the show's story has some of the most depth that I've ever seen in an adult cartoon.<br/><br/>Voice Acting<br/><br/>Although I am not a voice artist expert, I think that every actor connects well with their character. Most voices reflect on the animal's personality. Overall, the voices are good and each voice fits their respective character perfectly.<br/><br/>Art Style<br/><br/>The art style of this cartoon is very similar to Bob's Burgers. Most of the time it doesn't look very pretty, but I think the style is the most effective one for the show's tone and theme.<br/><br/>Award Time!<br/><br/>Best Overall Character: BoJack Horseman<br/><br/>Best Side Character: Tod<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>BoJack Horsman has something for everyone, whether you're looking for cheap laughs or a funny show that makes you think. Netflix has once again created an award winning series. I give BoJack Horseman a 9/10. I look forward to season two. When i first saw this show in the recommended list i tough it was just gonna be a regular comedy, but oh boy i was wrong. This show perfectly combines comedy and drama each of both elements standing out in certain episodes. As the show went on, Bojack the protagonist of this show started to grow on me, i started understanding what was going on trough his head that made him do the things he did in life, i started understanding his struggles, he is not just a meaningless cartoon character, it almost feels like he has a soul just like any real person person. The voice acting is terrific, no complaints there.<br/><br/>This is the only review i ever made for any show/movie in my entire life, i'm not good at writing this kinda stuff but i did it just for the sake of this show. It's goddamn brilliant. I wonder how could someone leave this show a 1 star review, i mean you might not like it that much personally but 1 star? wow.. When I began this series, I had absolutely no clue how incredible it would prove to be. I was a fan of adult cartoons before seeing BoJack, I initially expected it to be one of those shows with some funny moments and occasional good messages, however upon viewing, my mind was completely blown. It was first recommended to me by a friend and I saw a few episodes, I thought it was okay but not amazing, but later on the new season (at the time) came out and he recommended it to me again, I picked up where I left off and after a couple more episodes, I was entirely hooked. Never before had I seen such hard-hitting, heartbreaking, emotional topics handled so elegantly, whilst still consistently achieving hilarious humor. In my opinion, BoJack is the second best TV show ever to exist (the first being Breaking Bad) and I 100% stand by BoJack as being the best show on Netflix, way better than the pathetic excuses for shows like 'Paradise PD' and 'Big Mouth'. I recommend this show to the moon and back, but get the tissues at the ready. I started watching Bo Jack when I was 17 years old.
I am now 23. This show grew in depth and maturity as I did. The way that it captures the darkness and ugliness of life, while also celebrating in its wild crazy unpredictability, is like nothing else.
While I struggled with purpose, meaning, mental health, drugs and the rich expanse of life that is sometimes so difficult, I felt I could relate to Bo Jack Horseman. It is a very honest portrayal of many things. And a very, very, gloriously silly way to do it.
I grew with these characters. There is something profound about this. This piece of art, that I know will never be done again. The attention and care and genius that is here, is worth celebrating.
Thank you for Bo Jack Horseman Bojack Horseman is not another family guy or Simpsons because it actually tells a story that feels real. This is a funny and wacky cartoon but is actually has emotion unlike family guy. In family guy you get the same repetitive episodes pumped out with less emotion as the show goes on. Bojack Horseman manages to be really entertaining and funny but also makes you feel for the characters in the show. All the voice acting and animation is really well done and the writing is very clever at times. This is mostly because it finds a way to make fun of modern society and Bojack is the one who points it out to the audience most of the time. <br/><br/>This is one of the best cartoon comedies I've seen and I would highly recommend you watch it. I started watching this show with very low expectations, about ten minutes in I was hooked. Will Arnett is hilarious as usual. It reminds me of "Daria" and "ugly Americans", it is grounded and dark but funny nonetheless, I found myself watching the whole season in one day. If you enjoy Seth MacFarlane or south park type shows and expect something similar then this show will completely disappoint you, think more of arrested development meets ugly Americans, it's a grown up show, the writing is smart and may be boring to the simple-minded. But at least in my opinion it is excellent and refreshing, and I hope to see it go on for years. Where do I even begin with this show. Is it as good as everyone else is saying? Yes, yes, yes and yes. As a big fan of animation this show caught my eye my eye but I never got around to watching it because it looked like a generic animated sitcom. Since then I've loved many adult cartoons like Futurama, Rick and Morty, South Park, The Simpsons. But after I heard all the praise BoJack has been getting I decided to check y out. And I couldn't stop watching it. What begins a a typical satirical cartoon sitcom quickly becomes a dark, depressing and raw look at the celebrity business. But it's also a character study about a depressed washed up TV actor who hasn't regained his fame since the sitcom he starred in ended a long time ago. He is a complete asshole. He's the most unrelatable character you can imagine. At least, that's what you think at first. As the show progresses his character is given a lot of depth and relatability. And it hurts. You realize how broken every character is and how broken you might be as well. It's not a pleasant watch, but man is it excellently written. This is easily the best show on Netflix and if you haven't watched it yet do it as soon as possible. 10 /10 (if not a 9/10) On the outside, this show appears to be your typical silly cartoon based on the satire of modern Hollywood, but as you dive deeper, this seemingly hollow show is filled with deep themes based on our basic needs and wants as humans. Through the quick one liners, puns, and thought out jokes, this is a show about the choices we make in life. Shorterm goals vs longterm goals? Is it better to live life dumb and ignorant or aware and sad? The endless themes including family, true love, the definition of real happiness, are all hidden behind what seems to be just an alcoholic washed up celebrity. The show itself is a metaphor that nothing, and nobody, is what they appear to be at first glance. And finally, it poses a question to the audience: is it ever too late to change the path u have chosen to live? I want more.<br/><br/>See, the pilot is incredibly mediocre and, as others have pointed out, leverages the joke format of other tried and true animated shows. But this is business as usual, really. Animated pilots are typically sub- par. I LOVE Bob's Burgers, but man, that show's pilot was a mess.<br/><br/>What's important is that Bojack does find itself as the season progresses, and there's something really new and interesting here. I think the writers started out thinking they were writing a comedy with dramatic elements. Somewhere along the way, they realized it was the reverse. The majority of the scripts are dedicated to pursuing the internal foibles of the characters, and if a joke wanders in at the edge of the screen, all the better for a bit of levity amidst the existential darkness.<br/><br/>And then there's the Netflix money. Now, sequestering a bunch of celebrities in one place does not guarantee success (something I wish Stallone would figure out). However, there's a pretty rich voice cast here, and once the show hits its stride, Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Aaron Paul, Paul F. Tompkins, Kristen Schaal, and others give the material it's due. Arnett, in particular, as Bojack manages to take on equine form and make me forget Arrested Development's Gob almost entirely; no mean feat.<br/><br/>By the end of season 1, the five principal characters are pretty well- drawn and acted- fully fleshed beings. What's more, the world finally lives up to the glorious surrealism of the opening sequence, throwing some very human failings in stark relief with a world bizarrely populated by anthropomorphic animals. Give Bojack some space, and you'll find one of the freshest shows of the year. Here's hoping for season 2, because I'm fairly certain the best of Bojack is yet to come. The opening of the show is a succinct depiction of the general feeling expressed in every episode. I have frankly been tiring of the increasing" anti hero" complex penetrating the mainstream surface. I am sick of being tricked into feeling sorry for asshole characters who create their own problems, probably because I, too, am an asshole, but I enjoyed this show. The contrast of the anti-hero in the character of BoJack to the every-hero in the character of Mr. Peanutbutter was interesting enough to keep me watching, and didn't leave me irritated.<br/><br/>I had initial doubts, because in the first few episodes, the humor seemed a bit contrived and the jokes are presumably directed at the Family Guy demographic, in the form of long, awkward moments of characters holding a word for extended periods of time, outlandish cutscenes, exaggerated newscaster asides, and rips on Dane Cook. I should probably add that I am not particularly a fan of Family Guy. There were other jokes/story lines that seemed a bit borrowed from other comedy television hits(Louie, Arrested Development). However, when the show finds its stride, about halfway through the season, and emulates other popular TV shows less, is when I really enjoyed it -enough to binge watch it until its end, enough to recommend it to friends, and enough to leave it a good review and rating here. <br/><br/>The jokes become smarter as the season progresses. If you're looking for an uproarious and constant, laugh- out-loud comedy, this is not it. The humor can be subtle at times, chuckle and smirk worthy, with short bursts of humorous rants regarding real issues in the media, the entertainment business,and the human psyche. The Buzzfeed jokes were brilliant, there were great backdrop jokes that I had fun spotting (Mr. Penguin's mug reading, "World's Third Greatest Dad", for example), some unique and well-placed physical comedy courtesy of the animal characters, and a few decent puns. <br/><br/>The animation and voice acting are both excellent. The characters have depth and are likable, and they seem to grow as the season progresses. The only static character is Mr. Peanutbutter, which is intentional. <br/><br/>There's SOME confrontation between the characters, but in a humorous way, and there's not so much that it seems like the writers are intentionally pandering to a human sense of drama- voyeurism to get views without offering much else. (Girls, Orange is the New Black)<br/><br/>Overall, when the show concerns itself less with what people will like, and gets to the meat of all the unique intellect, comedy, and heart it as to offer, it's very special. <br/><br/>8 out of 10. <br/><br/>P.S. When the credits roll and the closing song is swapped out with another song, it really irritate me and I feel like it kind of takes away some of the feeling you're left with at the end of the episode, especially with the season finale closing with that irrelevant dance bullshit. It reminded of Girls, and God I hate Girls. <br/><br/>Sorry if this review seemed bitter, with too many references to the other series. The reviewer is on summer break, and has had ample time to waste. Did you know that how depressed you are is inversely proportional to how many cheese sticks you eat, and how many episodes of Golden Girls you watch? BoJack probably does. And this is why the reviewer loves BoJack. <br/><br/>Can't wait for the second season. If you can get past the first three episodes will be witnessing a hell of a show. As they say with mental issues, "It gets better". And it sure does. This show is funny and emotional. They make you feel bad for characters out of your species, gender, and age range. Watching this made me relatable to characters I'd never expect to relate since they're so grounded. It's a bit over the top at times but it IS an animated show. Watch it and you'll get amazing fleshed out characters and stories that will make you think about life and your choices. I've been a little bored with Netflix recently as there were few shows left to watch. Yesterday i noticed this on the homepage of Netflix, i clicked on it and i was instantly hooked! This series is very well animated, the voice acting is fantastic even though they do use some of the same actors twice. It's got a lot of good plots and good jokes and it's very enjoyable. If you enjoy shows like Family guy, Rick and Morty or Regular show i guarantee you'll like this. This is as icing on the cake a Netflix exclusive, so for once an animated show will only be available at Netflix, IT WAS ABOUT TIME, i really hope Netflix will continue this series and everyone with the time on their hands should really watch the hole series in a mind-blowing hilarious marathon like i did. After 6th episode, it's going dark. It's goint deep. It contains a lot of thinker's philosophic ideas and it shapes its scenario with these ideas. Must-watch! Except first episode or first couple episodes. What started life as a bizarre satirical take on Hollywood, with many prominent figures taking animal forms (Quentin Tarantulino for one), adapted, evolved and flourished as an emotional rollercoaster of a TV show that was, not only able to tell an engaging story whilst tackling the sides of mental health that others shy away from, but was able to do it brilliantly.<br/><br/>I was a bit late to the party for Bojack as I started watching after the third season was released, but thankfully that did give me ample opportunity to binge my way through it and get sucked into its bizarre world. The show revolves around the life of 90s sitcom star Bojack Horseman (Will Arnett), from his abusive childhood to late adulthood all whilst touching on themes of depression, addiction and accountability. From that premise spreads a world of ideas and situations that are on the one hand, too bizarre for live action, but on the other, just too real.<br/><br/>Attempting to define Bojack is tough, in season 1 it presents itself as a comedy, which predominantly derives from its alternate take on Hollywoo (where the D is stolen). But in later seasons, the show progressively lends itself into areas including fantasy, drama, tragedy and even musical to name a few. What's more impressive is how this animated show manages to land each genre perfectly, adding layers of symbolism and hidden messages to keep audiences on their toes. However, its' true achievement is in the characters. Not since Breaking Bad have I managed to generate significant emotional investment in an entire ensemble of characters. From the pushy, yet endearing Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), to the shy, nerdy and heart-breaking Diane (Alison Brie) to even background characters such as the comedically perfect loose cannon that is Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface.<br/><br/>My first realisation that Bojack was a different type of TV show arrived around the final two minutes of its' eleventh episode (Downer Ending) where Bojack implores Diane to tell him that, underneath his selfish, narcissistic and destructive behaviours, he is a good person. That emotional gut-punch of a scene floored me. But that moment laid precedent for Bojack Horseman to place its mains in emotionally driven situations involving their past, their mental health and their fundamentally human flaws. This all adds to what makes the characters painfully identifiable. As a result, its eleventh episode would become the first of many episodes to truly resonate with audiences on a level that most other shows could only dream of attaining.<br/><br/>However, this type of storytelling can be made or broken by the writers. Thankfully, Raphael Bob-Waksberg knows exactly what he is doing. Whether it's a 20-minute monologue channelling the emotions surrounding the death of a spiteful relative, a depiction of what happens in a person's head or even when a character will administer a snappier tongue-twister that gets increasingly wittier, Bojack Horsemans' writing never lets up. Paired with animators and a cast who collectively manage to portray every emotion felt in a situation to harrowing effect, then you have a show that can bring you from laughter to tears within mere scenes.<br/><br/>There is so much more to say about Bojack Horseman as it truly is a show for the ages. Thankfully, despite the final 16 episodes contending with two seasons worth of content, the closing two episodes manage to round this beautiful saga off on the perfect note. So, all that's left to say is farewell and thank you to Bojack, Diane, Princess Carolyn, Todd and Mr Peanutbutter, you were all in a very special TV show I have never been rewarded more for sticking through the early episodes of a show than I have with BoJack.<br/><br/>Sometimes it seems premature to call something the best there is if it hasn't been around long enough but after 3 stellar seasons of the Netflix original BoJack Horseman, I can confidently say its not only the best show on Netflix, but arguably the best on TV right now.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great shows out there, and to each their own, but I find it hard to believe there is a show that blends humor, heavy topics, controversial topics, tragedy and depression as well as BoJack does.<br/><br/>If you are one of the many people that were put off by the first few episodes or your friends said they "couldn't get into it" after the first few episodes, I strongly encourage you to give it a second go.<br/><br/>Without going into too much detail or spoilers, the tone of the show changes drastically towards the later half of season one, and it is in season two and three that the show truly comes into its own.<br/><br/>I have never written a review on IMDb, but I could not resist doing so for this show. Despite how terrible a person BoJack is, I find myself empathizing and in a way rooting for him. From a first glance, you would laugh yourself silly if someone told you the most relatable character on TV was a talking horse played by Will Arnett, yet he is.<br/><br/>You will laugh from start to ending, you will cry and maybe even become a little depressed, question your own morals but throughout all this, you will fall in love with this show. If you dislike the show then trust me it's a good thing, it means there is nothing broken inside you, but if you liked it then you know you are thankful, thats it.<br/><br/>PS - Do not judge it by it's first season. Um, hello, people, this is the most brilliant show available right now in any medium. Are you that blind??? Do you seriously NOT get the JOKE????<br/><br/>OK. I'll calm down. I'm getting excited. Bojack is the next generation of storytellling. Its managed to expose every hypocrisy and deception practiced in the Fed up hollywoo industry world. And in the news media world. And in relationships. And keeps peeling down into that infinite onion, extracting tears as it peels and peels and peels away the layers of lies we live in.<br/><br/>I live for this show. Every season is better than the one before it. This show is art. I started out this series with high hopes. I struggled getting through the first three episodes where I feel like the show was trying to get a grip on what it wanted to do... and after that. It's an utterly beautiful show with a surprisingly deep undertone. A cartoon has never made me feel with the level I felt when watching this show. 10/10 There have been a lot of shows that have changedy perspective on life and / or made me view it in a different light. But this is the first show that truly made me drastically change my opinion on it. That's probably the highest praise I can give to any show. So glad it was a part of my life. First episode and generally first season is bad. But after 11th episode, it becomes a perfect series the watch. And i'm saying it again. It's the best show of decade. I'm so sad that such a great show has come to an end...A truly underrated masterpiece, with such a deep meaning under its scenes, its humour and its characters. Propably the first time a series has touched my soul so deep and made me think...because it is so damn HUMAN, even though the main characters are animals. It was nice while it lasted... This show gave me goosebumps in almost every episode. That's it's power. Bong Joon Ho told you all to overcome the one inch distance of subtitles to be introduced to a whole new cinema, well I'm saying you all to get over your fear or repulsion of watching a "cartoon" show and just watch this one. Coz it's not a mere "cartoon", perhaps a greater show than most of the real ones. Not going to say anything else. Several reviews I've read on BoJack Horseman indicated the show was out of date. The show fits in more with the height of the Adult Swim reign of animation and not the intelligent output of American Dad or Archer.<br/><br/>The show's primary problem is that the first two or three episodes were unforgivably substandard and that is generally all the time a critic can give a show in a TVscape as crowded as this one. <br/><br/>The pilot episode, heavy with exposition (which is understandable) zeroes in on protagonist BoJack Horseman in his pre-development state and he's as uninteresting as can be. The second episode tries to mine humor out of a taboo topic-- Political correctness and how we regard the military as heroes -- and not only fails, but paints BoJack as somewhat of a buzzkill a la one of the Crane brothers (from the Frasier era) at a tiki bar (or pick whatever non-Aristocratic setting you choose to complete this analogy).<br/><br/>The show's primary gimmick-- anthropomorphizing many of the characters in subtly clever ways and mixing those into the human world-- is enough to pique one's interest during the early episodes but if one quits the series early, that's all they'll find: An only occasionally funny Hollywood satire that's been done before.<br/><br/>"BoJack Horseman" isn't particularly easy to get into, but a few episodes in, the show's pathos and interesting character dynamics shines through. Like Will Arnett's previous work, "Arrested Development," the show features characters who aim to be dynamic and get out of their ruts in life. Unlike "Arrested Development" however, the show dares to give them, and us hope, at actual improvement and toys around with the idea of whether the characters are going anywhere at all. Either way, there's a definite investment to the characters by season's end that gives the show life. <br/><br/>The satire also starts getting sharper once the hidden jokes and the parallels to ABC's TGIF line-up of the 1990's start to reveal themselves. It seems funny to be describing a cartoon show where the main character is a horse and in a world where humans and a variety of animals interact as a show that is the most representative of modern society. However, Bojack Horseman provides a glamour free realistic representation that you don't witness in most TV shows.<br/><br/>Whilst the show may get off to a shaky start, it really gets up and running halfway through the first season and by Season 2 and Season 3 the show is in its element. Perhaps it is the fact that nothing seems to go right for Bojack or how every relationship ends up in flames that makes the show seem so right.<br/><br/>For example most shows would provide consistently unrealistic 'happy endings' but contrasting and more depressing endings are consistently portrayed in the show. This is clearly highlighted in the episode Old Acquaintance where Princess Carolyn completely messes everything up whilst Gekko and Rabitowitz have all their dreams come true because "we're the good guys" or in the episode It's You where Bojack doesn't actually get an Oscar nomination. It seemed all too corny when Bojack received his nomination and most shows would have just left it there but I love the boldness of the creators to suddenly make Bojack's world come crashing down. The epic bender that results highlights Bojack's depressive state and his role in dragging down those around him e.g. Sarah Lynn.<br/><br/>Bojack's epiphany at the end of the final episode of Season 3 hints that perhaps he has finally realised that there is more to life than fame and awards - perhaps we will see him make a concerted effort to change.<br/><br/>We need more shows like Bojack Horseman that provide us with the comfort that we aren't the only ones who seem to screw up and struggle to keep the world around us from falling apart! Perhaps it is the fact that Bojack offers us this unique perspective that makes it one of the best shows around. When I initially read the summary of what the series was I was excited because of my love for 90's style cartoons and I thought that it was a strange enough concept that might just work. <br/><br/>When I started watching it I thought it was a tad slow but I guess they have to establish which character is which and give a little personality of each character so I'll forgive it for that but when the series got going I couldn't stop laughing. It uses the typical comedy formula that is used in a lot of comedies now which is escalation. Things keep on escalating till they are ridiculous and that teamed with Bojack's ability to say the wrong thing is a winning combo in my book. <br/><br/>Although it does have many laughs through the series it still has serious moments and some sad moments too which I thought gave Bojack more depth as a character. The character manages to not be at all like the viewer but also very relatable to the same time in the observations he makes about life. <br/><br/>Overall I thought that the series is defiantly worth watching, especially for fans of comedies such as It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Very good stuff and glad its been renewed for a second series. I rarely rate anything, especially login to rate (Except GoT Finale, you know what i mean.) But Bojack is something different. I came for a quick laugh tv show, and i stay because of my heart cant stop thinking about it. Must see for anyone who cant get past the Alcohol When I began watching in 2014 I was not expecting to be witnessing one of the best tv series, not only animated, on the making. It has everything for everyone, comedy, dark humor, drama, plot twists, a bunch of smart references that anyone gets to a certain point, philosophical messages, life lessons and so much more. Its truly one of the most complete and unique tv shows ever produced. Aaron Paul was one of my favorite characters, I couldn't possibly imagine Todd without his voice and character. The same could be said about Diane, Princess Carolyn, Mr. Peanutbutter and the horse himself, Bojack. A wonderful cast with such brilliant performances due to not only but also the fantastic and deep script by Raphael. Even though it was not their decision, I'm glad they ended BJH. This last season if one of the best I've seen, everyone got closure, including us. Its a masterpiece for the ages and a tv show to repeat several times, I bet it only gets better. I've just finished the final season and it did not disappoint. Over and over, this show manages to innovate, make you laugh, make you cry and make you think. The surreal balances with sharply-observed wry societal commentary. One of the best series ever made - and will make you look at the Hokey Cokey in a completely different light! It was July 22, 2017 when I first heard about the show through my best friend. Yes, I remember the exact date because it's worth remembering. Since then, I've literally lost count on how many times I've watched the show already. It's gotta be around 10-15 times. I've heard of me-being-a-well-adjusted-non-fanatic person, but this is ridiculous.<br/><br/>At the time, I already dug dark comedy, but Bojack Horseman rose to a totally new level. After that many watches, your show had an effect on how I understand relationships, emotions, humor, and the search for meaning. Some people may label as unhealthy to relate to a depressed, drug-addict, fictional horse, I get it. But that's such an unfair statement. The show is incredibly nuanced and it got so many people to reflect and open up about their struggles. <br/><br/>What else can be said about Bojack Horseman? I love that it gets so deep and dark and yet extremely witty and funny. The way the characters portray different personalities and evolve over time is brilliant. The show also dares to face current, sensitive subjects with amazing creativity. The attention to the detail is just sick, and at the end it all comes full circle. The underlying message would be something like this: we should accept the imperfections of the human (and animal?) nature and, from there, try to devote our efforts for betterment.<br/><br/>As a side note, since I'm Spanish, I also used several watches as a conscious English-learning practice, and while this may sound crazy, it's been the resource with which I've learned the most English, ever. I've also watched it a couple times in German and who knows which language will be next. It never gets boring and since I know every single line, it's very easy for me to follow the story and learn the language by taking notes consciously.<br/><br/>I feel so grateful to the creators that gave this show life. Through Bojack Horseman, I got to know you and somehow you made me feel better understood in this journey we call life.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful show. I'm a better person because of it. It gave me endless hours of top-notch entertainment, a lot of food for thought and a beautiful, emotional ride. It will remain in my heart forever. So far there have only been 5 seasons of this show, and they have all been great. It takes a bit of patience, but if you stick around till about season 1 episode 11, you will be sucked in. This show is incredible, after the tone gets darker, it is never bad. This quality and depth is especially prevelant in season 5. Without getting into spoilers, it includes maybe the darkest story arc of the series, and a 20 minute monolauge from BoJack that just hits you in the guts with emotion. This show is incredible, watch it now. And I can't wait to see where this story goes from here This show managed to be relevant, painfully realistic, sad, depressing and a masterful work of art all in one. And the crazy thing is: ITS A CARTOON ABOUT A TALKING HORSE PERSON! This also managed the be the best animated series not only in the 2010's decade but probably of all time. But the sad thing is its gone. Bojack horseman is gone and everything is worse now (if you've seen the show you'll get the reference) this show is incredibly depressing but also is pretty hilarious at times. Its just an amazing show. Go watch all 6 seasons. NOW No other show potrays mental health as good as this show.. beautiful in every way... Shows us the reality of the society we live in. It's realistic, dark, deep and true to life stories. That's why I loved it from the start to the end - it so got into me. This was truly overwhelming experience. Sad the day has come the show has come to a end after becoming attach to the characters.
Wish it could or gone on for a few more seasons :( The premier of Netflix's Original animated series, "BoJack Horseman", left a considerable impression on me - enough to prompt me to write my first IMDb review. It is a profoundly deep, adult-themed parody noir starring animal characters with a touching sense of humanity and redemption.<br/><br/>"BoJack Horseman" stars an incredible cast of voices including Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris, Paul F. Tompkins, Patton Oswalt, and even everybody's favorite, Aaron Paul, Breaking Bad's own Jessie Pinkman (as, shall I say, in some regards a strikingly similar character) as a gaggle of offbeat characters with memorable personalities.<br/><br/>The series is well produced, with a sort of quirky, funky, "Entourage"-ish type of intro laden with a stylish combo of CGI-charged animation sequences and upbeat electronic music.<br/><br/>I can see how it is possible for certain viewers to have discredited the series after the pilot, because on the surface, this show appears to be a collage of clichés that we have seen from other animated comedies. However, the reason I referred to this series as an "animated series", and not "animated comedy series", is because it is not always a comedy. Unlike other animated comedy shows of which I am also fond, (i.e.; American Dad, Family Guy, The Simpsons, Southpark, etc.), "BoJack" struck me on a much deeper and profound level.<br/><br/>Once I got past the show's unconventional name (titled after the star character) and even stranger premise, I started to see the show's true angle. Daresay, at first, the premise felt a bit contrived and played out - washed up, middle-aged, two-bit Hollywood actor turned hedonistic glutton tries to find redemption in life -, but the series itself turns out to be one increasingly intelligent parody after the next. The characters are even parodies of themselves and the actors' enthusiasm and role dedication only add to the authenticity of the show.<br/><br/>Let me explain by contrast. For instance, take the character Klaus from Seth McFarlane's "American Dad" - a German spy the main character, CIA agent Stan Smith, has transplanted into the body of a goldfish. This character says some of the funniest, most outlandish quotes of the episodes but I never really feel that the character has an authentic relationship to the family, the show, or the overall plot.<br/><br/>Most of the characters in "BoJack" have the feeling of a real, authentic connection to the plot and do not feel so contrived for comedy's sake. The show is not loaded with extra characters like Family Guy's Greased-Up Deaf Guy or Southpark's "Midget in a Bikini". Even though we love these characters and they make us laugh, they don't have a real profound meaning to the story or plot. "BoJack" has some repeat appearances of minor characters for continuity's sake, but they are kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>Long review short, the reason I didn't give "BoJack Horseman" a 10 out of 10 review is because, frankly, nothing is perfect. At a glance, the "clichés" most viewers will notice will seem contrived or distracting, but these are meant to both serve as foundations for the show's plot, and a means to keep things light even during darker moments (and believe me, this show has plenty). Even if this show uses some clichés, the writers have found ways to spin them into fresh material that seems truer to the real world than the animated world. <br/><br/>As I said to a skeptical friend a few episodes into "BoJack Horseman", 'You have to give it a chance, don't lump it in with other mindless animated comedies of the same genre.' Once you do, you will be glad you did. Yep, that's right. You read the title of this review correctly. For those who don't watch the show, you may be wondering why I called an adult comedy animated Netflix- only show about an alternate reality where animals live like humans which centers around a has-been celebrity horse who was in a famous family sitcom in the 90's "one of the greatest shows currently on television". In fact, I'm just as surprised as you. I started watching this show on a whim and it turned out to be not just one of the greatest comedy shows I've seen, but one of the greatest shows that I've seen, and I mean that wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>The show contains satire of celebrity culture, mass media, large businesses, and Hollywood (or Hollywoo) in general. It exposes our willingness to accept the easy answers, and our idolization of celebrities. It does this in many episodes through both a news reporting whale and "A Ryan Seacrest Type", and in both the abortion episode (containing probably the most hilarious fictional pop song ever) and the Hank Hippopopalus episode. But the heart of the show comes in its characters, and their arcs in the show, in which they encounter a surprising amount of questions about not only their existences, but ours as a whole. It's a surprisingly poignant show, and it's characters, despite being mostly animals, are deeply human.<br/><br/>Bojack is a man who is looking for a purpose in life, even if he doesn't know it. He wants love, but the only love he's ever been able to receive is from his fans, so he drowns out the rest of his life with booze, and occasionally (in probably the two best episodes of the entire series), drugs. He wants to outrun his past, and his mistakes, but he's always forced to face the consequences. The people that surround him, however, are just as interesting, and just as flawed. Diane is a woman who wrote Bojack's biography, and she has lots of strong opinions which never seem to go anywhere, despite all of their controversy. There is Todd, who ended up as Bojack's best friend pretty much on accident, and often gets himself into large over the top situations, but is just as real of a character as the others, especially in season 3. And there is Mr. Peanutbutter, a golden retriever, who is way too positive (almost) all the time, and is often Todd's sidekick, as well as Diane's wife, whom he keeps positive most of the time, as Todd does to Bojack. Then finally, there is Princess Caroline, Bojack's agent who has stuck with him through many years for several reasons, some of them being: her need to prove herself as an agent, since her job is pretty much all she has at this point in her life; she feels a need to clean up others' messes; and of course, she knows deep down that Bojack will always be there for her, because he also has no where else to go. The common thread that unites these main characters however, is their constant pursuit of happiness, love, and purpose in life. Whether it be through their job, or their significant other, or their friends, or in attempts to come to grips with their past, or alcohol, or fame, or even just a loosely connected series of wacky hi-jinks, their all looking for something.<br/><br/>The show on top of this has some beautiful symbolic imagery, including the thoughtful ambiguous final image of the third season, as well as many other final images that I will leave for you to discover. To top it all off, it's one of the most consistently original shows right now in terms of the structure of the episodes, whether it be an insane and incredibly well-animated fourth wall breaking, hilarious, surprising and devastating drug trip in "Downer Ending"; a whole episode about love in which three separate couples have fights (two of them being phones); a critique of Scientology, but replacing it with improv to show its absurdity; Bojack's memorable "Escape From L.A." in which he reunites with his old friend and stays with her for months; a film noir episode where Bojack is framed for murder, which leads to a long convoluted case that him and Diane attempt to uncover; a "Lost in Translation"-esque episode that is completely wordless in which Bojack wanders in a foreign country (underwater); an episode revolving around a "closer" for a newspaper company attempting to close Bojack by helping him figure out the various problems he's been having; an entire episode based in a restaurant, revolving around Bojack's relationship with Princess Caroline; and of course Bojack and Sarah Lynn's months long bender told in a fractured black out structure, and many more.<br/><br/>And this was really only scratching the surface of the entire series. Sure it's got silly animal puns, and and an absurd sense of humor (*cough* J.D. Salinger), but it's genuinely funny, and surprisingly so much more than just that. Best tv show of all time!
Not just animation series, but best all over.
Smartest writings, funniest characters,
you name it, it's all here in bojack's world.<br/><br/>You will fall in love with this depressing funny horse, right from the beginning of:
Chaptttttttttttttttttttter one.<br/><br/>I cant beliebe that this show has an ending, Bojack was responsinle for my own hapiness.
Now i won't be able to make myself a breakfest. This show started out as yet another tile on my Netflix home screen. I thought I'd give it a try for some goofy humor with anthropomorphic animals but it soon started to take on darker subjects that made me completely forget that I was not watching humans or even real people. Asking questions like "Am I good enough?", "Will I be remembered and how?", "Has anything I've done ever had any value?", this show offers a point of view everyone can, at some point, at least partly, relate to and really got me thinking. Some of the best Animes I've seen (Yeah, I know what you're thinking) have shown similar depth and character development but along with them, Bojack Horseman may well be one of the best animations ever produced. <br/><br/>This show left me empty and emotionally devastated - I can't wait for more. I was apprehensive about watching this show, initially drawn in by the novelty of Will Arnett playing a talking horse, but put off by the general tone of the first few episodes.<br/><br/>Oh, how I am glad I kept watching.<br/><br/>Once it became clear that this was not the typical TV show where everything goes back to normal at the end of the episode, everything begins to click into place. Every action has a consequence. Seemingly small details from earlier on can rear their heads in a big way, and do. The show relishes at pointing Checkov's gun directly at your face, and yet still manages to surprise you when it actually goes off. Combined with Archer-esque levels of continuity, the engrossing imaginative world grows with every episode, almost a character itself.<br/><br/>The social commentary surrounding the show is surprisingly deep, often disguised as observational humor casually brought to light by one of the characters. Oh, and the characters. Every one of the main characters has their own skeletons, their own reasoning, and their own depth never before seen in an animated show.<br/><br/>Don't come in expecting pure comedy. The jokes are there and you'll laugh, occasionally. Guest stars add variety and humor. But the story, the setting, and the crippling realism are what will get you hooked. Like the movie 'Funny People,' the focus is less on the jokes and more an in-depth examination of a cripplingly flawed main character and the damage he causes to the people who love him, with a gritty authenticism punctuated by Will Arnett potentially giving the best performance of his career.<br/><br/>In conclusion: BoJack Horseman is an instant cult classic, continuing the trend of excellent adult-oriented animated programming. Netflix continues to be the premiere producer outside-the-box entertainment, and you really should give this show a shot. An interesting show. I liked the first few episodes well enough. The main character is kind of intriguing, and the humor, while low-key is good for a few chuckles.<br/><br/>Right around episode four, the whole show takes a startling turn. I'm not sure I had a laugh for the rest of the season, but, didn't care. Please, if the first few episodes don't quite grab you, consider sticking with this 'til the end. I was glad I did. Will Arnett does the best work of his career in this slightly strange, primitively animated ditty.<br/><br/>The main characters are well-conceived, and they're people you come to care about. The plots are simple, and the story arc predictable, but it's about the journey, or course, you silly fool. Watching this show develop is like watching an ugly weed growing in a pavement crack blossom into something beautiful and cool.<br/><br/>I don't know if there will be a second season. I hope so. At the same time, I wouldn't mind remembering these characters as they stand at the end of season one. Not many have heard of this masterpiece. An underappreciated gem of a TV show. Every episode is a film unto itself, with great voice acting and powerful writing. A show I hope more people would watch. THE BEST. You would relate to so many characters and scenes. The character development is mind blowing, the story writing is amazing. The ending couldn't have been better. A MUST WATCH. I can't even imagine a show that means as much to me as bojack. it's been with me through my ups and downs, and both bojack and i have grown so much. the last two episodes are one of the best finales i've ever seen, and this show will live on as a masterpiece for years to come. Oh, Bojack!
Honestly I'm too overwhelmed with all the variegated emotions to write a coherent, let alone an articular review.
I love how inclusive, sensible, and real content is being developed in TV off-late.<br/><br/>This adult-swim drama following the life of a jaded horseman (an yester-year sit-com star, after his stardom dissipates), is one of the finest, underrated gem in its likes. In this age where memes are a whirlwind cultural revolution, where "relating to" is proven to be more cathartic than expressing what's on our mind, this show gives a taste of what it's like to be on the receiving end of that vicarious empathy, illuminating the ineffable emotions we never knew we had giving words to our deepest untouched feelings. We grow to learn its value only after we experience the pain that comes with living with those inexplicable emotions. The felicity that the creators displayed through their fleshed-out characters is commendable. Watching the characters throughout their journey into better versions of themselves is intensely gratifying, given the great nuances in the plots . The writers know what they are talking about, through their characters. They have immense respect for all the people that deal with mental health and other issues, or even those who are deviant of societal norms. Watching it was ineffably cathartic. When I couldn't express what I was going through successfully to my friends and family, I asked them to watch this show, that's how educational it is.<br/><br/>The chucklesome idiosyncrasies of animals in this anthropomorphic L.A, not-so-subtle roasts, oh-so-casual name drops are genius. Depression, death, nihilism, asexuality, addiction, life after stardom, the depressing reality underneath all the glitz and glamour is dealt with chutzpah. This show is a paragon of that kind.<br/><br/>Despite being set-off as a showbiz drama, the truth-bombs that are dropped can be extrapolated to every person in all walks of life. Every word in this show is a gem in its own right. Every line of every character is like a wisdom packed in wit and whimsicality. After a really touching dialogue, the characters go about in their erratic pursuits making those absolutely valuable life lessons not heavy-handed yet thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Although with the pilot, it can start off like an yet another superficial, commercial, hackneyed, half-baked cartoon for adults. Trust me if you sit through it, you are gonna thank yourself for that. This show is as real as reality can get. You simply cannot get lost in this happy world of TV to forget your real life because it's not. It makes you laugh, bawl your eyes out, and most of all makes you quite uncomfortable with all those home truths and thoughts you have been avoiding by trying to watch this show and also make peace with them. Depsite not being a substitute for therapy, it is therapeutic to watch Bojack Horseman for reasons you'll only know once you start watching it.<br/><br/>
This most realistic "unreal" world that will always remain close to my heart since it depicted my most favourite topics using my most favourite form of portrayal i.e., animation pushing the boundaries of visual narrative (the best thing about animation is it doesn't have any "limitations", which otherwise seem berserk with humans in it) to drive the ideas straight from the creators' brains to viewers' hearts.<br/><br/>P.S: My '9' is the standard 10 and my '8' is the standard '9'. Bojack Horseman scrambles your mind. With more than few funny and memorable comedic breaks, the moments that stick with you are the sad and disturbing ones.
Look through the comedy and you will find a valuable life lesson.
The first five seasons make sure you require therapy, and the sixth season delivers the therapy you require. BoJack Horseman is one of the best show i ever watched, the show have so many well-written characters, clever humor and maybe the best representation of depression, grief and addiction. The show may not have the most realistic portray of mental illnesses but it's truly capture the feeling of those illnesses make us feel.
In addition, rarely have i seen a show that have a truly logical, thoughtful and realistic solutions for most of the characters of the show. And it have maybe my favorite quote of all time: " Sometimes life's an itch and then you keep living " What makes me love this show is how it seems to show redemption and bettering yourself as an actual complex problem. They don't sugar coat it showing you'll have highs and lows and how easy it is to slip back into old habits. The latest season seems to even be showing that even if you do change the people you hurt don't owe you forgiveness and your past actions may scar people for life. That you don't suddenly change and everything works out, life will throw crap at you and tempt you to go back to your old comforts but you have to stick with it. It is probably the most grown up message I've seen from a show in a long time and it comes from one starring a talking horse man! I've never written a review, but BoJack has made me write one.
BoJack is everyone one of us and I think each of us can relate to the character.
The show will make you laugh and then drop you from a cliff and you will keep wanting more .
This is the most unreal show but still as real as it gets. It took a horse and other animals acting human to make a show as real as it gets .
I'm so sad that it's ended and I'm thoroughly gonna miss the show .
You are BoJack.
They are BoJack.
I am BoJack. Having written almost no reviews till date for many of the amazing shows i have had a chance to watch. This one seems quite the exception which i would regret leaving by. Not only because many have dared to write negetive just after watching a couple of episodes but also due to the factor of such ignorance that might mislead people from actually watching this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Other highly rated animated shows are more often a result of cult following and originality first hand. This of course feels undoubtedly original but also supercedes any other animated show(i have watched every single one of the highly rated once and consider them all good, unlike people who always try to find bad in almost anything. I repeat none of the shows above 8.5 will disappoint you.) This is quite unique in the fact that unlike other shows this has tremendously real emotions and practicality. The animal transfusion brings out sublte comic value and adds to the unbelievable originality of the show. The straightforward dialogues from almost everyone paces the show more than any twisted suspense can. And moreover just because it's an anime, it covers more ground than any real show could ever have. Bojack is one of my favorite shows I've ever seen. The first thing you notice is the absurdist comedy that comes from a world populated by human-like animals and humans. This and the rest of its comedy never gets old, but this show has much more to offer than wacky fun characters and hilarious comedy. The show looks at some of the most major intimate issues: existentialism, the meaning of life, struggles of addiction, the cycle of trauma, and how mental illness impacts its characters. The show delivers on every front, always remaining unique and expertly dealing with extremely impactful characters, character arcs, and themes. So, Bojack Horseman has been with us for 6 years already! In the meantime, I've read how some people claim that it's too dark or not realistic... But even though the characters on this show are animals, they often display more human emotions than some other shows that are on the air today (or that people will admit to). For this reason alone, I would recommend anyone to give this show a try.<br/><br/>I've loved Bojack Horseman for its raw display of emotions and it's insight on how bittersweet life can really be. Often, without knowing or a direct intention to, a lot of people who've been thought these experiences were also hurt by someone that stood close to them and they will - more often than not - end up hurting the people that they interact with. Even though they initially didn't want to or didn't know that they actually did.<br/><br/>Neither less, this show enlightens us with the struggles a lot of people go through in their relationships with their close friends and family members, who sometimes only find out later in life how much the person they repudiate has been through (or how much they were/are really suffering). Some might even say that the concept of blaming the victim has a place in this story, as a lot of people don't understand why people might act in a certain way or blame them more when they find out how much they've actually been through. Throughout the seasons the characters stay true too their initial characteristics and the show - sometimes painfully - displays their coping mechanisms while they struggle with the problems they face over the course of several seasons.<br/><br/>The last season felt a little different from the previous ones, but so does anyone we might know that is trying to change their life for the better or who is trying to evolve from the destructive ways that they used to demonstrate. I think the show was very well written and for anyone that isn't looking for just a quick laugh, it can give you some insight in the way how life can turn out with all of its consequences.<br/><br/>PS. My favorite episode was "Free Churro", which effectively exhibits how an episode set in just one location can have a very deep meaning in what it is tying to convey, in contrast to an episode or even a whole season set in different locations but without a real message. BoJack is one of the only shows that analyzes characters from many perspectives and leaves it up to the audience to interpret what it means to them. BoJack isn't a "feel good show" by any means, which I feel like isn't a spoiler. It is funny with its jokes but also extremely sad at points, kind of like life in a sense. BoJack is more of a show that makes you think, understand others perspectives and ultimately teaches you that nobody is perfect, and that many things contribute to that, and makes you question what you think is acceptable or not. I'm sure as I go back and rewatch it some day, and that even if I don't, it will be a show I will always remember and think of, and reflect on, which is a really impactful thing. I really don't give this a 10 lightly. If you are sensitive to topics of suicide or death, I might avoid this show but otherwise you definitely can't miss this one. After six seasons, "BoJack Horseman" is over. What seemed like a light parody of burnt out former TV stars quickly turned into one of the heaviest, thought-provoking, and most rewarding animated shows on Netflix (or anywhere really).<br/><br/>The second half of season six sees BoJack - after years of self-destructive behaviour - finally turning his life around: he's been sober for year and has started a rewarding career as a college drama professor. Through the next eight episodes, the investigation into Sarah Lynn's death threatens to sabotage his stability. Of course, BoJack being BoJack, he does some bad things and ends up in prison by the final episode (which turns out to be a good thing; giving him the routine and stability he craves), with the ever-loyal Mr. Peanutbutter driving him to Princess Carolyn's wedding, where BoJack (on day release) makes peace with Mr. Peanutbutter, Princess Carolyn, Todd (who is far more mature now, with less crazy schemes and an actual job), and - most importantly - Diane (who has finally stopped sabotaging her happiness to get married and become a successful Young Adult fiction author).<br/><br/>The final scene - with Diane and BoJack talking on the roof - is perfect; BoJack (worried that'd he'd selfishly sabotage the wedding) sees a happier Diane and is ok with it. The unanswered question is: with Princess Carolyn, Todd, and Diane no longer there to support him, will BoJack follow their example and seek genuine improvement? Or will he fall into the same old traps once he leaves prison? The ambiguity suits the show's finale and will fuel endless 'what if' fan theories.<br/><br/>Fortunately, there's enough levity with the usual blink-and-you'll-miss-it sight gags, pop culture references, surprise voice actors (the return of Margo Martindale; Zach Braff playing himself as a butler in the second-last episode's weird purgatory-dream state) and clever wordplay.<br/><br/>Overall, BoJack fans will be satisfied with the conclusion. As most reviewers have already said, this show has an unexpected depth in so many issues such as depression, society, happiness, relationships and meaning of life. At first, I thought it was a typical american sitcom with easy jokes and simple storyline because the half of the first season is like that (I think they're just trying to introduce the characters) but as the story unfolds, the viewer is presented with a representation of flaws in every single character. From the low self-esteem of Bojack to Todd's problem of finding himself and ignoring it by doing nonsense and stupid projects. 
Undoubtedly, a very interesting show where several conclusions can be made, I strongly encourage you all to watch it and draw your own conclusions about all these issues the show embrace, because that's the most enjoyable part of Bojack Horseman in my opinion. I understand why BoJack Horseman is the king of the Netflix's animated shows. I really loved the show. Every single episode is very funny but deals with today's society, with a lot of emotions. I kind of felt inside the story, like I was part of it. It made me feel a lot of things and the plot is very taking. I'm really looking forward watching the next seasons. Please excuse the tone of this review, which is more of a love-letter rather than a descriptive evaluation, but I believe that "BoJack Horseman" is a high quality, unique, and groundbreaking show. Here's my ten reasons why, having watched up to season 4 at the point of this review:<br/><br/>1. "Slapstick subtext" (not my term - look it up to see the original analysis): What this show does is that it gets the characters to casually drop bits of deep and highly conscious self-psychoanalysis in the most low-key/non-dramatic way. What normally remains in the subtext of a typical drama (e.g. viewers can infer deeper conflicts and emotions from subtle cues in the acting) becomes fully disclosed in the most explicit way and in the most unexpected moment (i.e. no drum-roll, no climax). It's slapstick because it's in-your-face, it's funny because it's unexpected, but it's also highly meaningful.<br/><br/>2. It digs really deep. This show tackles the most crucial questions about human existence head-on and it unearths the deepest, most difficultly expressed, feelings/hopes and fears of the characters and of the audience.<br/><br/>3. Attention to detail (part I). The creators have paid attention to every little bit of the background of each scene. An obvious rewatchability factor, this element is really impressive. There's hidden jokes and references almost in every frame.<br/><br/>4. Attention to detail (part II): Continuity. It's just really well- planned and well-executed. In each episode you will find links and references to episodes even a season or two back, and you will struggle to find even the smallest continuity error (I don't think I've ever noticed any, despite multiple rewatches). They even add little bits of retcon to rectify implausibilities of older episodes and make the show's universe even more consistent. <br/><br/>5. The acting. It's top-notch, the main actors are totally nailing it and there's an impressive cast of guest/recurring actors who are doing an equally good job (I suspect more and more big names will guest star as the show's popularity keeps increasing).<br/><br/>6. The music. The creators have an excellent taste, each song selection and each original piece is incredibly fitting and meaningful.<br/><br/>7. The humour. (The very fact that I got to point 7 listing this show's strengths before getting to what would be the obvious main quality, is telling within itself). This show is hilarious.<br/><br/>8. The tongue-twisters. People say this show is "very punny" and it does indeed include a lot of word-play, but its signature move is the Dr. Seuss-like rhyming tongue twisters. They just add to the show's uniqueness and they are funny and fun to try and repeat.<br/><br/>9. The anthropomorphic animals. What I thought might be off-putting before I started watching this show (especially since I have a weird fear of horses) is actually incredibly cleverly done and adds a lot both to the characterisation and to the humour. You quickly get over the implausibility of the premise that this world consists of a mix of humans and human-sized/human-like animals when you think that a lot of people that you know - though not everyone, hence the selective animal...isation - actually remind you of animals (right? think of those Benedict Cumberbatch - Otter memes), not just in terms of physicality but also in terms of character/disposition. The added humour comes from the fact that the animal-like characters have real animal properties and reactions mixed in with their otherwise human behaviour.<br/><br/>10. Its take on social issues. No matter where you stand on social issues/ politics (and I happen to stand with the creators on most issues, as far as I can tell) you've got to hand it to the show for throwing in references and making a point about a variety of issues in a low-key, non-patronising way that does not interfere with everything else going on in the plot/humour/character development.<br/><br/>I could go on but I'll stop here. Just go watch this already! This show started so-so for me, but then the more episodes I watched the more I saw the genius, the humor, the philosophy behind it... It's incredibly creative, just like Rick and Morty but on a mature level and deals with real life events and situations. BoJack is a great character and you'll love him more every day. I usually take note of the negative comments on IMDb and i find myself agreeing with them often, however in this case I don't. They're negative not because they're smart but because they're exactly stupid and missed the whole point. Sad. Anyway, BoJack Horseman is a great show and I recommend it to anyone who likes art, entertainment and humor. 10/10, easily. This show is funny, heartbreaking, and endlessly insightful. It is full of silly animal puns and dark, soul crushing looks into the existential nightmare we all collectively share navigating this thing called life. Will Arnett is an unbelievably talented voice actor, bringing the titular character to life and making him endlessly relatable and empathetic even though Bojack could easily be played as a hopeless, narcissistic monster. The rest of the cast is equally fantastic. You love these characters. You want to hold them and protect them from the vapid void of Hollywood but at the same time you realize that even though these stories are set in an atmosphere so removed from your own life, these stories are painfully familiar. You want to help them because they are you. But at the same time, this show never falls into the trap of casting its characters as clear heroes or villains. That determination is left up to the audience. Every character is fully formed. Shown to have good and evil desires, and their choices, and their actions are yours to interpret and judge. The show is rife with puns, visual gags, and layered jokes and it gets funnier on every re-watch (much like Arnett's other vehicle Arrested Development). <br/><br/>If anything about this show is turning you off, please ignore that instinct and give this show a chance. I am so annoyed at myself for waiting so long to get into it and so glad I did. It is incredibly entertaining and incredibly thought provoking. You will walk away having experienced something more akin to fine art than a cartoon with anthropomorphic animals. I nearly never give things 10 stars, and I certainly never write reviews, but I felt it was necessary for this series. <br/><br/>The only reason I started to watch this is because I had a lot of shows I wanted to watch, and I couldn't decide what to watch next. This came up on the home screen, and I decided to watch something neutral that none of my friends had recommended to me. I was very pleasantly surprised. The show started out as a bit of a cheesy comedy, with a bunch of animal puns and clever jokes, along with good voice acting and fairly good animation. It then grew into something much more. <br/><br/>I almost gave the show up after the first few episodes, but I decided to power through. I'm so glad I did. The show has great character development, and delves into some dark subjects. I started to love it so much I watched the rest of the series in about 3 days. Watching the episodes is important, because there are some running jokes and things from the past you might not understand. The ending of the season was quite good, and I did get a little emotional. I highly recommend this series to almost anyone. Well saying this is the best show I've ever seen, doesn't really leave much to say,
and considering I sleep 3 hours a night and instead watch series, you can say I've seen a lot!
I can go on and on about how deep and dark and meaningful it is, but instead I just say it's perfect and I never expected anything to be this good.
The dialogues always repeat in my mind.In a lot of situations I remember them and it makes me feel less broken or alone.
To me this is more than just a show. it's something I can relate to and see myself in.
It's more real than anything I've seen, heard , or read.<br/><br/>Thank you for making shows this good.This is what makes tv worth watching. When I started watching Bojack Horseman on Netflix, I assumed it was just going to be another silly cartoon with no real purpose beyond a few laughs, a distraction from real life for half an hour at a time... I was wrong!<br/><br/>This is a rare show, something that you watch because you're bored one night, but you end up binge watching it all in a week. And you're hooked, and you rewatch it, because there's always a joke that you missed, a funny detail, or an easter egg.<br/><br/>This show is incredibly deep, and it achieves this in an interesting way, by using animals. It can touch on sad, painful parts of life, ways of living, and emotions, because viewers don't have to watch a human go through all of this. However, these animal characters are very relatable. You start the show emotionally detached, laughing at the funny animals, but by the end of the second season, you've already related to most (if not all) of the characters on a deep level at least once. <br/><br/>Sure, the events that take place in the show are often crazy and impossible. But the underlying ideas remain logical and realistic, and that's what's so beautiful about this show. You watch it, enjoy the insanity and the humour, but then you start to understand exactly what is going on. This show makes you think, but it doesn't slap you in the face with the ideas, it lets you figure it out by yourself.<br/><br/>I wish I had something bad to say about it, but I really don't. I wish that Netflix in general didn't drop a bunch of episodes once a year, because I have no self control so I binge watch for a week and have to wait a year for a new season... But that's my fault.<br/><br/>This show has some moments that are hard to watch, but that's why it's deep and emotional. These moments may shock you, but that's why this show is so smart. You watch these characters do crazy things, and struggle with emotions, but it's all real. The underlying points are always true, and the show may shock some truth into you.<br/><br/>Over all, Bojack Horseman is hilarious, interesting, emotional, and smart. I can't wait until the next season comes out! If I had to make a list of 3 shows I'd recommend that everyone watches, this would be on it. Parks and Rec would also be on that list, because I see a lot of similarities, as they're both funny but have realistic emotional points to make. Despite how repetitive it can get when watched in one bug chunk, I still absolutely love BoJack Horseman. There are many shows that in the final few seasons or in the final season become atrocious and you start rethinking all of the show. BoJack isn't one of those. The final season is great and the way it ends is good. But, that second to last episode... the way it made me feel about my own mortality, how much it made me question my life, it was devistating. The existence of the episode that came after kind of ruined that for me. BoJack has changed, yes, but he's kind of doing the same thing after prison, isn't he? His death would be more of a cynical ending, which doesn't work with how happy a lot of it is, but I think it would've just resonated more and put in place actual finality. I don't dislike the final episode in the slightest and I don't dislike the end of it, but I dislike its existence. Still, absolutely worth watching. Is it because i'm on acid or is it the best show I HAVE EVER SEEN in my life ??? , What a great creative artistic way to close, the closure with every caracter is a delight, the dialogs with Todd in the beach and princess Caroline are breath taking and a life philosophy resume to carry with, and the closure at the end on the rooftop with Diane feeling very familiar and facing the end is everything a fan can ever wish for a last episode, thank you for such an amazing artistic work , aplausos de pie !!! That is definitely the best animated series Ive ever seen BY FAR. It literally changed the way Im thinking about life and Im so thankful for every moment I could enjoy. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS SHOW, it was PERFECT! There is so many thing to say about that TV show but I just wanted to say this is the best thing I have been ever seeb on TV maybe in a screen. Every single episode leaves me in awe after the credits are done. Truly unique and one of the few shows that can make you laugh and cry in the same episode. When you think this show can't get any better, it surprises you. Season 5 is phenomenal. It has a depth to it but unlike season 4, it's funny as well. Brilliant. This show is a must watch. I don't know what to even say, it's really hard to talk about something as particular as BoJack Horseman.<br/><br/>Maybe you don't know, but this is quite the exception of the sitcom genre.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's funny, it is really funny, like REALLY funny, but BoJack it's not about making you laugh.<br/><br/>BoJack Horseman is a character study of the average Hollywoo actor, and the ultimate satire of the Los Angeles lifestyle like nothing you've ever seen before.<br/><br/>What makes BoJack stand out it's not the (let me reafirm: FUNNY) comedy, but the other half of the show - The story.<br/><br/>Not gonna say anything, just mentally prepare yourserlf for every 11th episode.<br/><br/>Masterpiece. This show is hilarious and real. It has it all; from silly animal jokes to dark humor and tackles really dark subjects. The struggles of life, depression, addiction, divorce, infidelity, Alzheimer's, childhood trauma, and so much more, are shown beautifully through great writing and striking visuals only possible through animation. I love this show and I've rewatched it countless times and you should too! When my friend told me that I had to watch this show, I took it into account and started it the following week.<br/><br/>I can't say I loved it at first. The pilot was pretty funny, the second episode got a bunch of laughs, but I didn't see what he saw in it. By the end of the first season, however, I did a complete 180. Downer Ending is the first of many reasons why this show deserves a 10/10 rating<br/><br/>This show grows and finds its place as the seasons go on. Personally I think season three is it's prime. It shows how the show can balance humor and seriousness and it stays with you for a while after watching. The last four episodes of this season are outstanding <br/><br/>It's the characters in this show that make it so good. Bojack, Diane, and Princess Carolyn especially stand out as the strongest. 
But it's not just the leads who I root for. Even recurring or guest characters make the show better. Wanda, Herb, Judah, Yolanda , Gina, Sarah Lynn, and Beatrice, despite not staying the full run of the show, have so much depth. In one single episode, Beatrice's mother becomes a favorite. <br/><br/>The humor in this show is top tier. The things you catch on rewatches, the wordplay, the puns, rarely don't land. And have often made me laugh out loud for real, and not just smirk or smile<br/><br/>This show is absolutely amazing if you give it a chance, and is without a doubt the best Netflix original The first couple episodes might seem like nothing that new or special, but directly afterward it completely turns itself around and introduces the deepest, realest and probably most relatable characters I've ever seen in an animated show. A pretty consistent plot is always there too, at times more in the background to focus on the characters, jokes, or to further establish the universe 
In my opinion all this just makes this show shine, and from what I remember there was never an episode that felt poorly paced, I could hardly put it down and finished the 4 seasons available in around one single week I must admit the first time I attempted to watch this show I gave up at episode 1.
Bojack horseman's pilot portrays the character as boring and obnoxious.
But if you get further into the series it shows its true colours.
The character development is some of the best I've seen.
A story of fame, betrayal, depression, loss and acceptance.<br/><br/>i look forward to what the new season has to offer.
it is definitely worth a watch and would recommend it to everyone. I'm honestly dissapointed how long it took me to watch this fantastic show; dark humour, so many jokes, deep scenes, LITERALLY. Emotional parts, so many real life relations; they literally made a 1 min clip for his 90s TV show to make it feel authentic & since it's a Netflix show they even put the release date at 1987; this show is so fantastic AND SEASON 5 in SEPTEMBER!!!!! I couldn't bring myself to give BoJack Horseman a number grade, because that would be comparing it to other shows. Someone might get the idea that if I rate the show a 10, I think it's better than other shows I or IMDb might have ranked, and that's simply not how I feel about the show. <br/><br/>On paper, BoJack Horseman seems pretty run-of-the-mill. A cynical, washed-up movie star and his kooky adventures with his wacky friends. But, if you stick with the show, it quickly becomes so much more than that. <br/><br/>Before I go any further, this show has some glaring negatives. The flash animation is highly unappealing for any avid fans of animation. Some of the voice acting is highly disappointing. Sometimes the show feels disjointed. I was disappointed with the portrayal of dementia in season 4, though it wasn't to the point of offensiveness, per se. And lastly, this show is not for everyone.<br/><br/>BoJack Horseman ultimately deals with self-loathing and confronting one's own self. Though many themes are layered on top of this, including nihilism, self-destructiveness, a search for meaning, etc., at the end of the day, the show confronts head-on what it's like to be disappointed in who you yourself are and the life you lead. And this is one of the greatest pieces of media I have ever seen tackle this. <br/><br/>If you don't feel out of place in the universe, this show is probably not for you. You may sympathize with BoJack and be dismayed at his choices, but they may not move you in any way. BoJack Horseman was crafted specifically to curtail to the thousands of young and middle- aged people who face themselves and their lives and are disappointed. The show asks if a person can ever change, and what a person's deeds are actually worth. In a time of irreligion, these are questions that plague the minds of many, many people. For them, BoJack Horseman becomes a companion, a recognition of the problem that they confront (or perhaps are running away from) every day.<br/><br/>The characters and situations feel organic. To some degree, the show is a deconstruction of modern adult cartoons. Mistakes have lasting impacts, and "the status quo is not God". Careful attention to continuity was given. There is a surprising lack of jokes. This is much more a drama than a comedy. A lot of jokes are animal-based puns that don't exactly gel well with the rest of the show. For instance, a guy walks into a bar, orders a grasshopper, and there's a grasshopper- person at the bar. The joke didn't connect at all to the rest of the scene. I wasn't sure if the show was legitimately trying to be funny, if it was trying to lighten the mood or set the tone for the scene, or if it was trying to give a cheesy joke to give the show some charm or endearment. <br/><br/>Back to the topic at hand. BoJack himself is very reminiscent of Bill Murray's character, Phil, from the movie Groundhog Day. The reason that movie has staying power is not just because it's associated with a holiday, not just because it has some good comedy, but also because of the depth and struggles of Phil. Phil is cocky and kind of jerk, but really, he's self-loathing. He can't find any meaning in his life. The movie is ultimately about Phil learning what has meaning, and he learns to appreciate the day-to-day. BoJack Horseman is very similar in that it's a self-loathing character and his search for meaning, but BoJack doesn't find any easy answers, and we're along for the ride. Though Groundhog Day may have been an allegory for someone feeling that every day is the same in their boring town, we go every day with BoJack, and every day is a new, different adventure that ultimately ends the same: with BoJack failing to see value in himself or in his life.<br/><br/>This show is certainly a unique experience. For some people, it will take them on a ride to, like BoJack, seek for meaning in their life. For them, this show is a must-watch that will literally ask them to look at life in a new way. For some people who are fully satisfied with their life and place in the universe, this show may just seem a depressing spiral of one man, told against the backdrop of some cheap animation and some grating voice acting. But for those who feel this show speaks to them, it was all worth it. Bojack Horseman is one of the most brilliant shows I have ever seen.It's witty,clever and heck it is also very depressing.Some episodes made me feel like choking with guilt.The characters are excellently voice acted and I liked Aaron Paul's voice of Todd Chavez.I love to see a happy ending for Bojack which may not happen any time soon :( .Animal puns are too clever and find myself laughing every time.I request everyone not to miss this gem of an animated show and watch it now.The main character Bojack...Horseman obviously is so relatable.This story tells you that money doesn't bring happiness nor any thing in life,It is to be accepted,experienced within you.Can't wait to re watch it and break into tears. For all the people that rate this show based on if it's funny, here's the deal, it isn't supposed to be. The show is mostly showing the sad parts of life that many of us experience at some point in our lives (bad relationships, childhood family traumas, depression, disappointment, lies, and everything you won't find in a "funny" show. Basically, the protagonist is (apart from a humanoid horse) a guy who had a sitcom during the 90's, now we are shown his life 20 years later, being mostly depressed, alcoholic, jumping from meaningless sex every time he has a chance, and it's a total jerk to almost everyone But the moments in which he is sober (not many) he realizes the self destructive behavior he has, and tries to do something to feel better, almost always making things worst. It's a show full of nihilism, not comedy (they try to do comedy with some of the characters like Todd or Mr Peanut Butter...but it's just doesn't work. I saw all the seasons and I really liked all of them, but not because it made me laugh, but it made me see some stuff of my life reflected on it Even tho it's a world where humans and animal-people live as if it was completely normal, the show is as human as it can get (ok, maybe not everyone would screw up as many times as BoJack does in every episode, but still, the rest of the characters also add up for some of the most common issues people experience in their lives This show is one of the finest pieces of television that I have ever watched. It is both full of puns, absurd wordplay, and crazy animal shenanigans, and also an intense journey into the dark nature of fame in the 21st century. The show can turn from a brooding exploration of Bojack's existential unhappiness to a crazy mishap with Todd and spaghetti in moments, but it never seems inappropriate.<br/><br/>It's ironic that the most human character that I have seen on recent television is a horse, but I guess that's where we are<br/><br/>(I have seen this several times, most recently in June 2017) BoJack Horseman might seem like a silly, stupid show, which was written by a highly depressive author with a pessimistic take on the Los Angeles high society. And yes, it might just be exactly that. But there is something in the character of BoJack Horseman that is as real as it gets. The more you watch this series, the more you come to root for the main character: for his love life, for his career, and for his friendships. This TV show draws you into a world of celebrities, but it dos not pretend to portray the amazing, sparkly life we assume celebrities to have. It tells us about the reality of thehollywoo(d) lifestyle and its stars. It lets us know that being a celebrity might not always be as simple or as fabulous as it seems, but that a lot of celebrities actually have the same problems, if not more problems, than us normal people do.<br/><br/>My main point is that the character of BoJack Horseman is as real as it gets, and I know I am talking about a cartoon here, but that does not matter, this show makes you laugh, and cry, and root for the main character, and then laugh, and after all that it makes you cry again; because you are just getting frustrated about BoJack, and you start asking yourself why he can't just, for once, hang on to things that might actually be good for him.<br/><br/>But exactly that is what life looks like. And if you would make a TV show about anyone of us (normal) people, it would probably look just like BoJack Horseman. Therefore, I can honestly say that this is one of the greatest TV shows I have ever seen, specifically because it is keeping it so real. Breaking Bad and Bojack Horseman.<br/><br/>No other Tv series can be better than these two.<br/><br/>Must Watch. The humour in Bojack Horseman is beyond your typical animation adult humour. This is mellow comedy. Almost black comedy. Bojack is one of those series that you may not get on your first viewing, but if you persist, you may very well find gold at the end of he rainbow. Every character is likable to some extent and every character is relatable, whether to you or people you know. <br/><br/>Bojack Horseman takes this humorous approach into an actors life which is very much like a normal persons life. It's raw, intense and well beyond expectation. I haven't seen an animation, let alone a show, that represents what Bojack Horseman represents in such detail and in such a surreal approach. Fantastic! When I first started watching this series I didn't understand why it had pulled me in. It took me one day of continuous watching so I couldn't really analyze what it was doing to me through time. But I remembered it. As something extraordinary. Without a reason. <br/><br/>Then the second season came. It blew me away. This time my internet connection was bad so I watched it during two days. I digested it much better because I kind of knew what I was getting into. I was more prepared this time. <br/><br/>The state of mind that the main character is in makes him really easy to relate. I'm sure the feeling of not knowing what to do with your life is unfortunately very popular now days.This show gives hope that it's gonna be okay. Also the lessons that it teaches us aren't dig that dip. So if you are looking for a reason to try once more at life this might be something you want to watch. <br/><br/>The ending of season two was so moving, motivating, and making future that much more hopeful that I just couldn't keep it inside of me. I feel like Bojack made giving up on life that much harder. BoJack Horseman is one of those rare animated shows that surpasses its expectations. When it first begins, it seems like your run-of- the- mill adult animated comedy, ala Bob's Burgers, Family Guy and the rest of them, but what makes BoJack different is that it builds up upon itself.<br/><br/>Unlike most animated shows of its format, BoJack is a continuous story, comparably closer to shows like Avatar rather than Bob's Burgers (although I like both of them) in how the show is structured. The episodes flow together in one coherent story, rather than being individual stories with a loose continuity.<br/><br/>So the story is about BoJack, an anthropomorphic horse who used to be a comedian/actor in a 90's sitcom. He's depressed and fed up with his current life, and wants to go back into the limelight, so he hires Diane, a famous biographical writer, to ghost-write his memoir. Various things pop up along the way, but I won't spoil that here<br/><br/>Due to the nature of the show, the comedy relies heavily on puns. The world-building consists of a mix of normal humans, and anthropomorphic animals of different sorts. Because of this, most of the humor comes from the interactions between these animals, and although the characters are mostly human in their behavior, they sometimes break character, and become closer to their animal counterparts. This brings both surprising depth to their character, as well as plenty of comedic opportunity.<br/><br/>But besides that, this show is surprisingly dramatic. I could easily compare the show to a film like Birdman, which both have similar themes regarding acting and the Hollywood business structure. There is plenty of time spent in developing the main characters, and even a couple of the side characters. This process grounds the characters in reality, despite its surreal art style and humor.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic show that should be watched by anyone with a Netflix account. The only major flaw is the first episode, which makes the show feel dull and by the numbers. Once you get past that, it gets a lot better. When I first started watching Bojack, I had no idea what I was getting into. I heard Will Arnett and Aaron Paul were in it, and that got me into checking it out. It begins with an undefined personality, like it's looking for the Family Guy's fans (with the between skits, which I don't like most of the time in Family Guy), also plays with the text humor ("An hour later", "After a boring conversation...") this last one worked most of the time for me. But after each episode, the show just gets better, it let's itself go and begins creating and developing its unique humor, satire and drama. It also creates some running gags, although they don't keep some of them going through the episodes, it's like they are afraid we'll get bored with them, but if Arrested Development could manage it, so can this one. But what I really like about this show it's its humor (which improves with every episode), and the social critics about media, fame, and society in general. I'm really looking forward to seeing the next season, and I would definitely recommend it, but it may not be a show for everybody. This series took me off guard. At first, I didn't know what to think about the anthropomorphic animals mixed up with humans, but I guess that's judging a book by its cover.<br/><br/>As you get to know the main character, you quickly understand that Bojack is an a**-hole. He's the perfect spoiled actor from Hollywood who doesn't care about the few friends he has. That being said, you also learn over time that he has a sweet heart as you follow him through the funny shenanigans he pulls out to impress a girl. All the characters who revolve around him are very well voiced, rich, profound and have a well defined personality so you end up relating to them.<br/><br/>On the humor side, there are a lot of dark jokes, visual jokes and many "inside" jokes coming back from episode to episode. I think Netflix played well on that knowing that you're going to end up binge watching everything anyway, so jokes do come back from time to time. But that also means that you kind of end up feeling like a part of their weird family. That's my new awkward family. Satirical humor like Family Guy, but way more thoughtful.<br/><br/>Spoiler: shout out to the amazing joke of the D removed from the Hollywood sign... all the characters and TV reporters end up just calling the city Hollywoo after that episode without ever referring to the accident as if it was all normal ah ah I'm so grateful for all the writers and artists for creating a show with such brilliant narrative. It really makes you laugh, cry and genuinely care for all these anthropomorphic animals more than I cared about in any other show.<br/><br/>It's a such an amazing experience and re-watching multiple times I can see the small details on the background related to animation, jokes and deep messages, some of them even foreshadowing the next episodes. As a "hobby writer" this motivates me to write more, I will never get to writing such a great mix of comedy and drama that this had, but at least I know that creativity and genuinely caring about what you are writing and adding to your story is rewarded.<br/><br/>This show leaves an extremely amazing legacy (and it ended with high ratings even, that is super rare!) to all entertainment industry honestly, with multiple videos about the philosophy of each character as well as some real relatable moments, not just shallow ones. The struggles with anxiety, depression, the guilt trip that some people move towards, being addicted to work, addicted to relationships... There's plenty of real messages to see here.<br/><br/>Thank you Kate Purdy, Raphael Bob-Waksberg and all the amazing cast of other writers (as well as the actors) for this show. I mean it. I hope you all are very successful because you clearly have amazing talent. This show is amazing, and it really hurts me that this show has this little followers. Just give it a chance, don't stop watching after 2/3 episodes! Stuck by it, it will make you lough, it will make you weep, it will hit you hard emotionally.
Just give it a chance, I think everyone who is a fan of Tv-Series, should watch it.. You will see by cartoon how the creators tell the story of everyone of our lives.
Some of the episodes are too dark, too emotional that you will not be able to controll yourself from crying!
And at some point, you will realize that we are all Bojack Horseman. Worst thing you can do when starting this show is expecting it to be just one more adult cartoon with edgy jokes and controversial characters because you would get slapped so hard with harsh reality of the life we are all living one way or another.<br/><br/>This show is so deep that it makes you go swimming through the sky full of stars on the sleepless Friday nights wondering what is happiness in this our life absolutely irrelevant and small in the universe of the billions of galaxies and why do you feel so wrong for not feeling it even after all this years of trying.<br/><br/>Creators and writers did hell of a job making show that is at firs sight funny and full of goofy jokes but than you play next episode and than next and then next and the you realize that goofy edgy jokes are just surface of the hole story
what is important is life that happens to the characters and around them and that is what makes people love this show. It is easy to project it on your own life.<br/><br/>Great thing about BoJack Horseman is that every season is better then the previous one, and when the line stars with a great season 1 you get season 6 of BoJack Horseman which is world for itself. Couple of episodes from season 6 may come to consideration when choosing best TV show episodes of all time but episode 15 tops them all. That episode is Bible of TV shows, it's exceptionally written with ability to hit hard in emotions and thoughts but not because of BoJack but because of ourselves. Compared to the poor adult animation that churned out over the years, this a gem. I have a big issue with the first season, where all bojack does is make sex jokes. However, The other seasons have an unusually good balance of comedy and serious topics. The show never stops to tell a joke, or the jokes stop to tell a message. Characters are exceptionally well written. Animation fits quite well. Great show (excluding the first season) BoJack is one of the most compelling and complex characters in TV. While his lifestyle is definitely not relatable to a normie like me, his thoughts and outlooks on life, friendship and love are. We find ourselves rooting for him, hating him and ultimately feeling for him as he goes through ups and downs centered in Hollywoo. Each season offers something new, whether its new soulful characters or story arcs, the show is always throwing things at you without loosing its sight.<br/><br/>I never thought an animated show starring cartoon animals would turn out to be one of the most philosophical and deepest shows about the human condition out there, but it is- and its funny as hell too.<br/><br/>I'll miss each and every character dearly. Its been a great time to spend with them. Horribly drawn to drawn attention to the plot and storyline of each episode. The characters and personalities grew into their logical mature ends. The main character is a detestable but relatable character. Tons of bad decisions and selfish shenanigans I have witnessed in some form or fashion or made in my life.
The undefined relationships and insecurities shine a light on their inadequacies and psychological problems. Which are the products of each character battling some type of addiction or mental health issues. This show captivated me where they get real with each other and confront real world issues. It's a no bs animation that call out the characters. Emmy worthy. Way too realistic for a cartoon drama. It has better storyline than The Simpsons and Ricky & Morty What started off as a comedy about a drunk horse trying to get his life together has transformed into a really inspiring epic about being real with yourself. All the characters deal with complex problems mainly involving mental health. This show gets real, even with its darker themes like substance abuse and depression. This show is not like Family Guy or Brickleberry. It gets dark and depressing, but it is so good!!! Give this show a watch! Well it's been realðŸ‘Š,6yrs/ 77 episodes later!, I can't believe it's over, it's too soon. Its a masterpiece and there will never be a replacement. This truly may be one of the best shows depicting depression on TV of all time. Don't let it being a cartoon throw you off, in the end its still just people talking to people. For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes/ references and that feels good. The writing is brilliant, beautiful and very traumatizing. Bye bojack, you will be missed. ðŸ˜¢ Sometimes I laugh, Sometimes I cry. Sometimes the show makes you think about lot of stuff around you. Sometimes it is totally weird yet feels so connected. Sometimes it is so hard to take in , Sometimes it makes you day. Take Sometime to watch this one Or you're gonna regret it sometime.
ðŸ™‚ If you want to spend several hours of your life
laughing,crying and trouble yourself with social themes,this series is the right place for you.
Simply the best animated series of all time.<br/><br/>Only for open minded people... I can say it with full conviction, out of the many shows and movies I have watched throughout my life, there is no show which covers the entire gamut of life so realistically as Bojack Horseman. People often say that the show talks about depression, however I disagree. As meta-physical as it might sound, I think it talks about life itself, with depression being a part of it.<br/><br/>Bojack does a wonderful job of exploring various types of personalities, relationships, career paths, family life, political (in?)correctness, and of course, depression, but more than that, happiness. Hats off to Raphael Bob-Waksberg and his entire cast and crew for showcasing this fantastic piece of art.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman is truly one in a million. As corny as it might sound, it has the potential to make you see yourself and your surroundings in a completely new light. It has the potential to really transform your perception of life itself. After all, "isn't the point of art less what people put into it and more what people get out of it?" :) Right away, when audiences watch Bojack Horseman they soon realize the show has more depth to it than expected. The show achieves to depths through various uses of real life struggles. Bojack Horseman shows its audiences realistic depictions of alcoholism, depression, and even addiction throughout the shows run. Its not all depressing though, at times the show will tell its audience despite life's downs to keep on moving forward. Altogether, the show is a major hit not only for its great story but how it able to relate to its fans. This show is different to others. It has so much depth, SO very much. It is real, relatable, honest. It is comical, but it is also a drama; willing to go into dark terrains story wise (though there is certainly dark humour too). This show is original. There is continuity between episodes and interesting and incredible character and story development. The voice acting cast is amazing, holy moly! Especially Will Arnett who plays BoJack himself :) There really is a lot of positive feedback I can give about this animation series. It is of high quality and I'm so grateful it was created, and for all the work that was put into it. It is certainly one of my favourite shows. I just really appreciate how real and vulnerable the main characters are. I appreciate so much their depth. I rate this show a 10/10, and recommend that if you haven't seen it and decide to give it a go, to watch several episodes (not random ones) before making up your mind. It's worth the time :) This hits really hard and eventually, you want Bojack to be ok because deep down, you end up wanting to see that he can be ok so you believe that you can be ok So I don't usually write reviews for TV shows or films, but Bojack Horseman definitely deserves one. Like many have pointed out, season 1 didn't really amount to anything, but soon after it all changes and before you even realise it, you're hooked on this show and begin to feel lost without it.<br/><br/>The story seems to tick away in the background with some truly bizzare episodes along with others that hit you right in the feels and leave one speechless. The humour and emotion is a perfect balance throughout the seasons. The last half of season six is utter brilliance featuring some truly exceptional episodes that capture just about everything. After finishing the last ever episode, I am left wanting more of the story and feel empty without Bojack. 100% in my top 3 favourite all time shows Mixing comedy and a dramatic story without ruining the narrative. Showing you an alcoholic actor struggling in life and trying to be better. While showing you his mistakes and struggles which we all can relate to. Very satisfying conclusion. This is the best all-around show of any genre on television since the first 9 seasons of the Simpsons. I started watching it knowing practically nothing about it, but thinking it sounded really stupid. I gave it a chance anyway and got hooked. It's definitely true that you need to get past the first half of season 1 to REALLY understand the greatness of this show. I won't say more than this: it starts as a silly adult cartoon parody of celebrity, but quickly turns into a highly effective meditation on self-loathing, depression, and substance abuse. And unlike other popular recent shows, the series ending does NOT disappoint. Why Bojack is the greatest animated TV series of all time won't be apparent to you for at least the first half of season 1. It starts fine, but it would fall under the "easy entertainment mildly amusing" banner occupied by family guy and American Dad. However, gradually Bojack and his companions become fascinating characters, and the creators gain the confidence to explore themes and ideas of a far more serious nature. The themes of addiction, mid life malaise, Holywood culture, inter generational trauma, and the difficulty of breaking your cycle of mistakes have rarely been tackled in more depth, or more with more creativity.<br/><br/>I can't think of many series in the last decade which have been as inventive as Bojack. There are many many episodes which stand out for being unique and memorable taken on their own, but which are even more powerful in the context of this bizarre comedy animation set in a world inexplicably filled with human animal hybrids.<br/><br/>When I think back on an old TV series I generally remember individual scenes or music cues which moved me at the time. With a particularly great TV series those images and memories will continue to move me just as much at the mere thought of them years after the fact as they did when I first saw them. Bojack is as filled with as many of those special iconic long lasting moments as almost any other series I've seen in the last few years. That says a lot for a series I initially didn't take second glance at. Ok s06e16 was the most powerful way to end a show but bojack were never the type for suicide, he always kept going, no matter what happens he kept going. And last episode stick to it, it fits perfect. nice show definetly gonna watch it again some time later. BoJack Horseman is so great in every sense that I don't even know where to begin to praise it.<br/><br/>I started watching this series after a couple of my friends recommended it. I am sort of new into this whole adult cartoon territory and have not overcome my prejudices completely yet (with the exception of Rick and Morty and South Park), so watching BoJack was kind of a big deal for me at first. Especially when you consider that characters are human & animal mix, I remember thinking "what is the deal here?" But at that point, the fact that the lead character naming the show is a human & horse mix admittedly aroused my sympathy towards the show (because, well, horses) and as it seems, there was some serious deal going on in this show.<br/><br/>You start watching BoJack and at first it seems like some weird comedy series peppered with a bit of original thinking, cynicism and not much different stuff to offer. WRONG. This show probably offers the best and deepest content on TV (whatever it means nowadays, Netflix) right now and what I love the most about it is the way it manages to get tremendously better every other season. I have not seen that kind of improvement in any other series, ever.<br/><br/>BoJack is basically the story of a famous-ish Hollywood actor who is well-known for the part that he played in a 90s sitcom and had not accomplished much since then. As you watch the show, you are invited to observe the phony Hollywood world through the life of this cynical, self-destructive and sort of messed-up-on-every-level (horse)man by means of wonderfully written scenes, characters and dialogues. I say wonderfully written without hesitations, because I have never seen a show that takes that much risk and pulls it off every single time. Each time I thought that they couldn't handle it or get any better than that, they somehow did.<br/><br/>This is as much compliment as I can offer without spoilers. Do not listen to anyone who might say that the show is pointless or stupid, I don't understand how anyone can say that about BoJack anyway. This is a must-see, raise your expectations by all means. Be prepared to feel a thousand mixed emotions, oh and if you get hooked on it, make sure to follow the show's official twitter account. It's awesome. With an undying habit of watching something to sleep and having exhausted my choices with all the "realistic" TV shows on Netflix, I was almost forced to watch Bojack and I was prepared to dumb myself down for this animated show where the main character is Half horse, half human and is not even a centaur.<br/><br/>It's when in the third episode, Bojack talks about the reality of life, that I realised that this is the most real show ever! Behind the hidden humour gems, which were not easy for me to decipher at times - and almost made me proud of myself when I did, is a continuous vocation about life's philosophies and why do we at times behave the way we do.<br/><br/>Bojack hates himself, and I believe that's not easy, not because one would not want to hate himself, but also because one doesn't even realise that one's hate-worthy.<br/><br/>Bojack horseman helped me understand myself better, helped me hate myself and hence love the rest of me.<br/><br/>Do watch this. And if you hate the show, by any chance, I think you have found one thing to hate about yourself! :) I really like this show, more than I expected to, tbh. Just be warned that its only mostly comedy, other times it reaches deep with several different characters, and, due to certain similarities in my own life/history, I found myself profoundly sad at times, even in tears, but then was back to chuckling in the next episode. And I personally prefer that type of episodic format over a show that just keeps trying to make you laugh endlessly; those kind get tired quick. So I suggest you check out BoJack Horseman for yourself, because I find it truly entertaining. Once in a blue moon, a piece of art will completely change your way of being. That art, for me, is Bojack Horseman. This show makes you think about yourself, in ways you don't really want to. You wonder if love is only an excuse not be alone, can I be happy, can people be good, can I be good, and the good old fashioned "What is the point?" This show is so incredibly powerful in its presentation, it demands you take good long, hard look at yourself and think about why you are here now; are you happy with where you are and if you aren't can you change and get out; and choices did you make to get you there. Despite being a show largely based around animals, this is the most human work I have ever seen. It is depressing and dark and real but it is also witty and funny and satirical. The fact that Bojack, the most human character, is not only worse but a sitcom star/Hollywoo (the typo is for a reason) celebrity is a perfect ironic joke. Other great jokes are a Little Rascals gag-like Vincent Adultman, who works at the Business Factory and dates Bojack's agent, as well as several animal puns like chickens selling chicken food products or Matthew Fox is a wolf, etc. Bojack, the show's titular character, is a washed-up celebrity of "Horsin' Around" fame. The show is essentially "Full House" but Bojack as a single horse dad. Additionally, the show features other characters like Mr. Peanutbutter (real name), the main character in a rival sitcom that ripped off Horsin' Around, Todd, the stoner forever house guest, and Diane, the ghost writer to Bojack's memoir. The show needs to be watched to be understood and its philosophy and humor makes it my favorite TV show of all time. The many many users who have reviewed this show so highly are the ones who went into it without a pre-determined idea of what this show would be. If you want to watch Archer, go watch Archer. Archer is a great show, I laugh my ass off. The brilliance of this show comes from the way that Bob-Waksberg and the writers can go deep into social, moral, and personal issues (does calling all soldiers heroes cheapen the word? why do we drain celebrities and then enjoy their downfall? how do I deal with a friend who doesn't want help? how do I deal with loss?), that can often be really depressing, and makes them approachable and allows us to laugh while thinking about them. It is remarkable. There are so many moments of pure cotton candy humor in there (the host of MSNBSea is a whale and the police officer who is a cat is named Meow Meow Fluffy Face), but this show is about how flawed people interact. Its real, there are no good guys and bad guys. I don't think there has ever been a comedy (cartoon or live action) like it. I cant wait for season two. I've always wanted to write reviews for shows and movies I enjoyed... and hated.<br/><br/>This fortunately is one of those shows that genuinely surprised me. I went into thinking I don't give some shows the time of day due to the fact there different or look weird. So I decided might as well start with this Netflix original.<br/><br/>I'm so glad I did as it engaged me throughout its twelve episodes. It may have not made me "lol" a lot. However every episode was funny and well thought out. Comedy shows have to be either gut busting funny, have great plot lines as well as being funny or both combined into one perfect show. Bojack falls into the second category as it isn't the perfect but I definitely think it is something everyone should watch or at least view a few episodes of. <br/><br/>The voice cast is great and I think they fit their roles well. As I said the comedy in the show may not be gut busting but I appreciated it and found it very funny. What stands out is the plot lines that go along with the comedy which adds character depth to a show which could of easily been a one shot gimmick with a talking horse. Music and animation for the show are great even though they are a bit simplistic, more directed at the animation there. However the opening sequence I thought was amazing and I wanted to watch it again and again.<br/><br/>Now I know I gave it a 10 so your probably thinking if it is not perfect why is it a 10? I rate this show as a 10 for the must watch factor rather then shouting it is the perfect show.<br/><br/>Overall for me this is a must watch show and makes want to watch the other Netflix originals apart maybe from Orange is the New Black but that is another review for another day.<br/><br/>Hope anyone who reads this finds this useful and watches the show because of it! This series has rocketed straight into becoming one of my personal favorites, by the end of it you will feel it's like an old classic. Bojack a washed up celebrity trying to cling on to his former fame as he makes his way through life in Hollywood. Whilst the show gives us wonderful comic moments of ludicrous proportions and great jokes all around within the story arc of the series is a tale of rare depth that will leave your mind thinking about aspects of your own character, those around you and more importantly life. There's not much else to say apart from go watch the first two episodes and by then i'm sure you'll see Bojack is worth of high praise all around. BoJack Horseman is a show that is very enjoyable to watch. The short run time of each episode makes it easy to get into, but what really pulls you in are the characters and the beautiful animation. This show offers a realistic take on alcoholism and depression as well as being very light hearted in other moments. BoJack Horseman is one of the best shows on Netflix and deserved 6 seasons. This was an amazing ride and one of the best experiences I've gone through, trust me this show is truly a masterpiece, I've been invested in this show for a few years but not from the very start I think, this will help you with depression if you suffer from it, or if you don't it will still teach you worth while life lessons and teach you stuff about your past. There could have been 1 more season as there was still more content, but it still ended perfectly. It has some of the best episodes I've ever seen in my life that are truly MASTERPIECES but you won't see that in season 1 continue to the end and 100% guarantee you won't be disappointed and will remember this show for the rest of your life with one of the best character arcs and most human characters even though some of them are animals this show deals with depression perfectly while still managing to have a light tone throughout the seasons (mostly) but sometime it gets really dark and that's what really makes this show great along with the attention to detail this show is a perfect show for multiple rewatches and you will discover at least 10 things in each episode that you most likely missed, just by watching it again that's how much effort these people put into this show simply, amazing.<br/><br/>
I will remember this for the rest of my life already feel like rewatching it and I only finished it yesterday. Most underrated masterpiece I've ever encountered and if this got more recognition it would be known as the masterpiece of a show that it is worldwide. I can't believe its over, because, and I cannot stress this enough, this was one of the best shows of the modern 20s.<br/><br/>The story was brilliant, the animation phenomenally intricate, the voice acting was exemplary. And it was funny as hell, all the way through.<br/><br/>Truly an ingenious portrayal of the arc of depression, I cannot recommend it enough. You only need one word to describe this series. Absolutely incredible. You seldom find shows written this well. The level of writing for this show is on a level of it's own, which only a few shows can possibly match. Each main character's development is handled well and the character arc of the titular character Bojack is exceptional!
The writing for penultimate episodes of all the seasons are especially outstanding! It astonishes you ho they raise the bar each time you think they've got the peak. I had massive expectations for the final season and it has turned out to me a masterpiece. The makers of this show deserve every big of praise they are receiving, because boy, do they deserve it! This show is one of the best pieces of media I have ever seen and the main character is a talking horse. The show has sharp writing with great storytelling and hard-hitting moments of emotion. The only problem I can think of is that the first season of the show is probably the weakest part of the show. That is to say it takes till the 6th episode for things to get really good. However, I found the characters to be interesting enough to continue with the show and I'm glad I did. I'll be sad when this masterpiece ends this year, but I don't regret taking this experience with the horse from horsin around Bojack horseman This is one of favourite shows of all time and I am so happy that I watched it because my god do I love this show and I cannot recommend this enough.<br/><br/>So I love All the characters in this show as they play big parts in bojacks life and help him and motivate him to become a better person and sure there are some which encourage him to do the opposite, this shows main characters are all memorable and interesting in their own distinct ways which are Bojack Horseman, Todd Chavez, Diane Nguyen, Princess Carolyn and Mr Peanut butter.<br/><br/>So I definitely recommend that you stop everything your doing and just please go watch this show. Honestly I was worried that BJHorseman will be another Family Guy or American Dad etc. with situational skit humor, but it is so much more. The writing is really intelligent, there is an overarching narrative that bridges different seasons. Sure, sometimes the situational humor detracts, but it is worth coming back to this over and over. Bojack is one lovable, tragic, handsome horse!<br/><br/>A special touch are the animal character references like flying seagull people, Princess Carolyn's hairball toys, etc. Really cute and imaginative. Really a unique show. This is my first time writing an review. I know not a lot of people are not going to read this but even though I do want to share my personal opinion about this show. At first glance this show seems like your typical wacky cartoon series, but after only watching a few episodes you're going to realize that this show has a lot more depth to it then one may assume. this show truly found it's own way to discuss and portray the effects of depression. A masterpiece of its own and truly unique show. In this animated series, the story of the life of one actor whose best years are left behind - Horse BoJack is narrated. The viewer watches his regrets, mistakes and attempts to fix everything (but more often the character will "run away" from problems in alcohol and drugs). And gradually the viewer will begin to see himself in BoJack: emotions are so skillfully conveyed here and BoJack's drama is so realistic. And then the series looks already with wild sadness in the heart, as if from taking the most effective depressant, and weak hope for a good ending. After all, if BoJack does not have it, then the viewer will not have it either. Bojack horsemen is refreshing, a show that respects the decisions made by characters and never forgets the 'plot threads' created. A show that truly understands 'loaded gun theory' and, seems to be, setting up to what might potentially be one of the most satisfying conclusions to a show within the Adult Animation genre.<br/><br/>I have not seen a deconstruction of the typical 'animated sitcom' done so effectively since Adult Swim's 'Moral Orel' way back in 2006. Bojack horsemen takes what is understood from many contrived animated adult sitcoms eg; Your American Dads, Family Guys, South Park even etc.. takes those central characters puts them in a Hollywood setting and shows how their horrible actions and down right destructive personality are horrific.<br/><br/>Bojack horsemen is a show with a lot of heart, and a lot of pay off. Every gag used, every small detail and development within the show is used to great effect. Actions have consequences, and so do the events happening within this world.<br/><br/>I am excited and sad for this show to finally end. Bojack Horsemen has set a new standard within animated storytelling and I cannot wait to see how, or where, western animation leads after this show. Who would have thought that a Netflix tv-show about animated, anthropomorphic animals could be this good? And after watching it, how can one even begin to describe the emotions that one goes through, following the journey of the characters involved?<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I can say that the show keeps a fine balance between being an excellent animated comedy series, with a few laughs to be found here and there, while at the same time being able to deliver some of the most gut-wrenching, hard-hitting scenes put to television. The humor is absurdly silly, especially when following the wacky adventures of Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter. But the primary focus of the show covers some deeply serious themes like mental illness, addiction, death, and the meaning of existence. It keeps the story driven by the simple fact that actions have consequences. This approach opens up and array of ways to explore the characters and their choices, both philosophically and psychologically, which Raphael Bob-Waksberg and the rest of the wonderful cast do exceptionally well.<br/><br/>I cannot state clearly enough, that the writing on this show is absolutely phenomenal.<br/><br/>The series only gets better the more you watch and in my opinion, every new season is better than the last. The sound design and animation itself is also great and has an astonishing amount of details put into them. The animal bystander transitions, for example, in-between scenes never fail to put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Definitely a must watch on Netflix. This is one of the best Netflix adult comedy series. It first I thought it's some generic comedy show but with time it's going real deep. It's not the comedy part I like, usually I don't laugh much watching the show. What's so special are the characters and I love this horse. Those characters work for me, I care for them and this is the most important part in a story. How the authors build up their characters, create conflicts and find a solution feel organic and well paced. Great entertainment. I usually don't write reviews in this website but the cleverness of this show must be addressed. It is a character centered drama with focus on its titular character, Bojack Horseman, and a cast of characters which include his friends and coworkers. In the world of the series, the earth is populated by humans and humanoid talking animals, which live alongside each other in society. The show uses the simple concept to its maximum glory, with funny animal jokes and puns, and in the peak of its writing, to heighten character depth and create plots.<br/><br/>To summarize the characters; a horse named Bojack, who after having done a successful 90's TV sitcom called "Horsin' Around", now lives his days in the wealth of his Hollywood house with his human 'friend' Todd, which slept in his couch for the 5 years he's been there. He has an cat ex-girlfriend called Princess Carolyn for an agent, is rivals with a cheerful Labrador called Mr. Peanutbutter, and befriends the human ghostwriter of his book, Diane Nguyen, which is dating the dog.<br/><br/>What may not seem like a great cast of characters can prove to me some of the best written and deep characters in recent television. Princess Carolyn and Diane both have very well put together backstories, and are morally complex characters, with many different and well put together arcs revolving around their work, lovers or any emotional background they're having. While Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter mostly serve comedic purposes, they are both three- dimensional characters, which have arcs and stories just as interesting as the other characters.<br/><br/>But the real star of the show here and the reason why it's so brilliant is Bojack the horse himself. He may seem at first the usual comedic asshole character you tend to find in a lot of adult comedy shows, packing one-liners and making jokes about everything; but at the end of the day Bojack is, simply put, one of the best characters in the history of television. While he slowly shows the person he is through his actions, his character shows true depth and realistic thoughts and feelings though the excellent dialog, bringing in philosophy and psychology in a way that instead of feeling alienating and far- fetched, it only adds to the themes and the understanding of them.<br/><br/>While the show is not entirely a drama, it is very brutal and real. The show doesn't hold back in making their characters suffer and go through tough times, and that characteristic is the series's main focus and it's what sets it apart from other similar shows. The way the characters, specially Bojack, are damaged and imperfect makes it hard not to connect and root for them in finding happiness. As soon as there's a new plot point, a new information, the spectator is ready to be completely enthralled by yet another bittersweet misadventure.<br/><br/>It's truly a special show; one of the most strangely realistic ones. Seeing that only 34,000 users rated for this show, I have to say this is really surprising. Personally, I've already watched BoJack Horseman 3 times. This show is amazing in so many different ways. Apart from the depression and realism that most people appraise about this show, there are also tons of tiny details that are funny and sometimes essential to the story! These tiny details depict the dedication of the creators and they are wonderful for viewers to watch out for. The story is also great, with astonishing twists and sad endings. This show is something that you MUST watch in your lifetime. OK, so when this show was being advertised back in 2014, I was initially skeptical. The marketing and advertisements didn't succeed in getting me interested. My first impression was that it was any old animated series along the lines of 'The Simpsons' or 'Family Guy', except here, humans and bipedal animals co-exist. I watched the pilot and needless to say, I thought it was mediocre. I didn't continue watching for at least a year and a half.<br/><br/>One day, I was catching up with an old friend from secondary school and at one point in the conversation, he said to me, "Do you know what TV show perfectly shows the stages of depression? Bojack Horseman." I thought he was joking. In my head, I thought, "What? That silly show about the talking horse?" After finding out that he wasn't joking, I decided to give the show another chance.<br/><br/>I binge-watched the entire series (Series 3 had been released at this point so we're talking Autumn of 2016) with a different eye. Yes, I will admit that the first few episodes are kinda 'meh.' But as the story carries on, you realise the poignancy and the realism of the situations (well, suspending your disbelief a little bit considering this show is full of talking animals) Bojack Horseman is a middle aged celebrity, famous for a cheesy 90s sitcom. His life now consists of dealing with his career, his personal relationships and his own self-destructive tendencies. In between having his biography written, starring in anticipated movies and dealing with his own personal demons, a lot of zany misadventures are thrown into the mix as well. This doesn't affect the tone though, miraculously as the balance of emotions and themes are pretty much perfect.<br/><br/>As animated shows go, this is a very rare example on one that focuses more on drama than comedy. The comedy is still there, but there's a real investment in Bojack's depression and the inevitability of his general behaviour ruining the lives of those he holds most dear.<br/><br/>The realism shines through as well, when you consider the fact that all of this applies to the celebrities of today. Hounded by paparazzi, pursued by strangers, your every move being broadcast, leading down a slippery slope to alcohol and substance abuse. It's really tragic as well because you can see Bojack desperately trying to do the right thing, but ultimately he screws up and the consequences of his actions come back to haunt him.<br/><br/>There's one image that always gets to me, and it's Bojack's sad face. It hits me on such a subconscious level that makes me feel sad as well. The tragedy is real, the drama is real, the voice talent is superb, and Bojack continues to be one of my favourite animated shows in recent times. I'm not a fan of adult shows. I expect the least out of them, mostly all of them focusing around shitty jokes about sexist, racist, and stereotypical jokes, with an unrealistic feel and no complexity. BoJack Horseman is a show that raised my expectations and made me think differently about what could be made in an adult show, if they had writers as smart as this.<br/><br/>In the neighborhood of Hollywoo, this show is about an anthropomorphic horse named BoJack Horseman, who starred as the main character in a 90's family sitcom titled Horsin' Around. Years later after his show had ended, he tries to force himself to get his groove back with the help of his own workers and friends, but suddenly drops down to rock bottom again every time he tries to.<br/><br/>In Season 1, it may look half-assed in the start and I almost got out of it. However, I tried watching more of it to give it another shot, and now I can't stop watching it. Seasons 2 and 3 are really hilarious. It's also heavily realistic, despite it's world where anthropomorphic animals live together with humans.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Summary of each season:<br/><br/>In season 1, BoJack Horseman hires a ghostwriter; Diane Nguyen, to write a biography about himself, He tries to connect himself with Diane despite her being with someone else; a golden retriever named Mr. Peanutbutter, who also made a sitcom inspired by Horsin' Around. He also gets help and advice from his agent and once-girlfriend Princess Carolyn, and tries to get his friend Todd to do things for his future, but it doesn't end up so well for his slacker-self.<br/><br/>There was a really stunning and to the point episode of the show's future in Season 1 involving the creator of Horsin' Around and BoJack titled "The Telescope." Herb Kazzaz, the creator of the show, has rectal cancer and meets up with BoJack after many years, but he never forgives BoJack for not meeting up with him when nobody else would.<br/><br/>In season 2, BoJack finally gets his dream, as he stares as the main character in a movie titled Secretariat. He ends up firing the original director, Kelsey Jannings, after trying to film a shot in a scene that wasn't supposed to make the cut. Mr. Peanutbutter and Todd do business ventures and they never seem to end up well. I love this season, mostly because of Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter's funny business plans, and also the episodes relating to PB's show, "Hollywoo Stars And Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!".<br/><br/>BoJack ends up leaving for two months during the production of his own movie to finding his old deer friend Charlotte, in the episode "Escape from L.A." after having visions of her during the show. He tries to get in touch of her, despite having a husband and kids, but he never tries. He also almost ends up having sex with her daughter Penny.<br/><br/>Season 3 is by far the best season. It shows the absolute dark secrets that Hollywoo has and how fame and fortune is less valuable then life. In this season, BoJack ends up finding Cuddlywhiskers, the creator of a forgotten 2007 show he starred in titled "The BoJack Horseman Show" whom disappeared after the show failed. He also gets into problems involving the Oscars.<br/><br/>Many of the episodes here are extremely memorable, I can't even say ONE episode that's the most. The season finale, "That Went Well," is a big hitter though. BoJack goes rock bottom and disappears from his original fame life in Hollywoo, while his once-friends do something better for their own life.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>There is A LOT that this show tackles with, such as fame, fortune, relationships, addiction, and parenting. There is so much more than what I've explained in my review, and I suggest you should AT LEAST get a Netflix trial if you haven't and check out every episode.<br/><br/>This is a must watch by anyone and meets new grounds for adult animation. BoJack got savaged by critics last year and was badly marketed so i only watched a few YouTube clips and moved on but a friend loved season 2 which got astronomical reviews so i started with it and stopped halfway though to watch season 1 first. S01 is a slow burn midlife crisis about a washed out actor/horse who tries to bounce back and sends the life of everyone around him into a spiraling depression that climaxes in a drug induced homage to Akira and the original Eva ending! Wow. The show though was marketed as a "comedy" so everyone was left confused at first but i obviously loved it. S02 on the other hand is Arrested Development with heaps of bestiality (thank you Netflix for giving me owl on horse action!) that ends up going after our favorite TV serial rapist Bill Cosby, Scientology and modern Hollywood in a post CGI age. It actually end in even more crushing depression as that is what comedy is supposed to do. To hate the viewer... Good on you Netflix and keep taking all the horse tranquilizers as the model is working but let's have someone of actual importance commit suicide next season. Comedy gold! This is an amazing animation that has a lot going for it.<br/><br/>From a technical aspect, the animation style reflects the premise of the show with character designs by cartoonist Lisa Hanawalt, a good combination of stylized cartoonish features to reflect the humour but at the same time, just enough realistic detail to make them just a little gritty like everyday real people, an appealing style to work a dramedy type show through.<br/><br/>The first half of the first season focuses more on the humour of what this unique world and colorful cast can offer and takes a bit to pick up into the sudden more serious dramatic overtones, but the evolution of the subtle overarching plot that begins to develop over time merges the serious and the silly into a riveting story.<br/><br/>Bojack as the lead expresses the heart and theme of the show, and is likable, in a drunken cynical sort of way, being voiced by Will Arnett who really captures the heart and identity of Bojack. The adventures of the side characters such as his roommate Todd (Aaron Paul), his manager Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), his autobiographer and courtesy straight man Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutters (Paul F. Tompkins) acts as both a great foil and reflection for Bojack, yet at the same time also well-established enough to stand on their own from time to time in subplots and also help to balance out Bojack's more depressive qualities.<br/><br/>The second season is where the show really shines, embracing its dramedy to the core, and not as episodic as its first season, with its overarching narrative structure being more prominent. The side characters are given even more space and identity separate from Bojack, particularly Diane. The characters are challenged more as individuals, with such a serious character growth and development, that they are made very real and very compelling to viewers, and some of the best characters to come out of an adult animation.<br/><br/>This is a surprisingly very moving television show that touches on some serious themes and life lessons, an ending that will surprise you. It embodies both the comedy and tragedy of life and the various personalities, each uniquely different from the other, living together in this world of ridiculousness and cynicism and for a time the spectator gladly lives this with them. What can I say about Bojack Horseman? It's such an interesting way of Netflix to define what adult animation can really do, and have such a lasting appeal to its adult audiences. I love just about everything about how a former washed-up actor can deliver such raunchy adult humor, and surprisingly, the jokes throughout the series does such an amazing job, you'll totally get the jokes and have a joy with the show's way of amusing you. Also, love how the cast has human and animals throughout, which kinda makes the show all the more reason to laugh and smile at how much fun the writers have and get away with a lot of things you can accomplish in an adult-oriented animated series, more so than live-action. Overall, Bojack Horseman is an interesting series to get into animation and have loads of fun-fueled entertainment that will surely be watchable again and again. It has been a very long time since I've watched a show that made me laugh so hard constantly every episode. "Good Vibes" was the last show that really made me laugh good and i have to say i think BoJack Horseman out does it. If your looking for something to just give you that great happy feeling every time you turn on an episode then this is your show! Literally every single episode had me laughing to the point where you begin to start doing that crazy sounding laugh that you don't do unless your just loosing your sh(i)t hysterically. Don't get me wrong when i saw the thumbnail for this show i was like "wow thats gotta be the dumbest show they've put on Netflix", but after i was gone for a weekend and came back home and was told my family member watched the entire season in one Saturday i decided i had to give it a shot and boy am i glad i did!!<br/><br/>5/5, 9.5/10! I don't even consider this a complaint or an issue with the show but i do have to say the last episode of season one was very funny but slightly less then the previous 11, that being said i still laughed my butt off multiple times. I honestly think i'd buy this on DVD i enjoyed it so much! I did not see that coming. I just didn't. First I heard of this series on a website that provided information about depression- as a psychologist I am alwyas looking for accurate and helpful descriptions of this complex and terrifiying illness and Bojack Horseman came up. Especially the negative thought spirals and lack of self-confidence Bojack displays are surprisingly realistic if you compare it with real patients' experiences. The series is also fun and the dialogues are terrific.<br/><br/>I cried several times whenever the little Bojack came up. Seriously. He made my heart melt and I felt so sorry for him. Almost wished there were not to many scenes about the little horseboy because I felt so sorry about the way he had to grow up. BoJack Horseman is epic, it keeps evolving and it's not afraid of facing sensitive issues.
One of my favourite shows ever. I thought it would be another family guy thank god it isn't I was surprised when I watched this it's a great comedy but it's also a really great drama. All the characters are brilliant
And I think this is the best Netflix original ever made Just when you thought this show about a depressed, alcoholic horse couldn't get anymore genius, season five proved what amazing writing and hearting stories can do to our main characters. This show is fckn ART
i watched every single episode and i LOVED it Really nice! Serie. Great characters original story. I hear from people who have only watched a few episodes of Bojack Horseman that it's too depressing. I disagree. I think it's dark and poignant and mixes that seamlessly with visual gags and thoughtful jokes. Absolutely my favorite netflix original and possibly my favorite cartoon of all time. I laugh out loud through entire episodes and get left at the conclusion feeling deeply thoughtful and somewhat morose and I love it. Bojack Horseman's creators don't seem happy with the status quo and are constantly reaching further artistically and I continue to be impressed. I relate to every main character in some way no matter how damaged they are and that is quite a feat. Perhaps I fetishize my own sadness but this cartoon makes me feel a range of emotions and I enjoy that. When you watch this show you sense the emotional corruption of bojack. This show gives you insight to the emotions that many people feel, in one way or another. BoJack's life simple a mess. Many show's you watch on Netflix are wonderful but you watch them and you are simple just view each episode with interest. When you watch Bojack horseman it truly show's the life of a complex horse that seems almost life like. From the beginning you see the life of bojack, throughout the series you experience the emotion growth and change of a disconcerted life . This show is clearly created with detail and true emotion.<br/><br/>Give this show a shot. You will complete the last episode and look back on the episodes and understand the emotional realness I speak about above. I, like many others on this board, didn't think much of BoJack Horseman at first click. I was instantly hooked. This isn't just another pointless animated show vying for laughs. It's got surprising depth, and points the finger at our narcissistic media culture. You're reeled into the life of this fictional character that could very well be any of your favorite sitcom stars of old. <br/><br/>It's funny, in a sarcastic, don't-care-if-you-don't-get-it kind of way. It's unapologetic. It makes its point in an uncomfortable yet necessary way. I love the way they develop BoJack. You hate him. You love him. You're not sure if you want to root for him, but towards the end of the series, I just wanted to give BoJack a hug. He's the asshole you love to hate. <br/><br/>I liked it because it's dark and funny and just my cup of tea. <br/><br/>Can't wait for season 2! After watching the first episode I was sort of on the fence with this but after the second and even third episode it just sucks you in! Brilliant, funny and a lot more in depth than you first realize. Cannot wait for season two. Amazing character development mixed with demented humor.<br/><br/>What is refreshing is that rather than throwing in a punch line every other line like other animated comedies, it is much more restrained in this regard and tends to build more on character development like no other animated series I can recall. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to get me to laugh and this series had me rolling in my own. This show is destined to be a classic. The best series of all time.<br/><br/>bojack horseman > rick and morty I thought that it was a great show and it even helped me with my personal problems but I just think that the ending wpuld be 100x better if they just left him dead instead of him going to prison BoJack Horseman is quite possibly the BEST thing (Movies, TV, and internet) I've seen in a long time. It's tough to describe the emotions I had while binge-watching all 3 of the current seasons, but let me tell you this: they weren't the happiest. BoJack Horseman is an interesting show mainly because it has a premise that, with any other creators, could be handled poorly and meshed into a generic, character-less animated TV show... but that isn't the case here. Sure the first few episodes paint it to be this way with tired gags and boring been-there-done-that characters... but then it changes. Suddenly, the been-there-done-that characters you thought you've seen in a million other animated TV shows are far more interesting, and the show stops being all cheery.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything about this show, because it's better you jump in with no prior knowledge of the show other than it's premise... but let me just say, it left me uncomfortable in many ways several movies and television shows could never have even dreamed of. This show isn't uncomfortable because it's scary, but rather because it feels so real. BoJack is the character you WANT to sympathize with, even though he's done more than his fair share of messing up. This show is one of the most human television shows on TV (despite it not actually being on, well, TV), but half of it's cast are animals. There are several themes in this show that several other shows don't dare to touch, and this does them justice.<br/><br/>Another thing about this show: it's funny. It's funny, but in a very dark way sometimes. It left me laughing my guts off at moments that, in any other TV show, wouldn't have me laughing my guts off. The writing is excellent, both serious and humorous.<br/><br/>This show is excellent! Sure, the first few episodes are not very great in comparison, but if you can make it past those episodes, then you're in for a real gem. BoJack Horseman manages to be funny, shocking, and mind-blowing all without constantly using the 'f' bomb or any other 4 (or less) letter baddie. This show is one of the smartest, and also more-so depressing, TV shows and is more than welcome to be among some of the best animated series... ever! That's a tough thing to say... "The Greatest Animated Series of All Time," but I stand by it. For those not in the know, names like The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park... even Looney Toons or Tom & Jerry might sound more appropriate for such a title, espeically considering the series has only been on for 6 years and is already slated for their series finale.<br/><br/>Well, for those in the know... well, you know.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman has done something no other cartoon has ever come close to. In such a short amount of time, the creators and writers have managed to craft some of the most outlandish yet relatable characters ever brought to animation. You'll cry, you'll hurt, you'll feel sad and happy as each character lives through the realities of existence and is forced to deal with each and every consequence they choose.<br/><br/>I could go on forever, but you owe it to yourself to watch this show. There's nothing like it out there and I'm sad to see these characters, who I've grown to care for so much, bringing their tales to a close. I love everything about the show. Personally one of my many favorite character driven adult shows. The writing on Bojack Horseman is phenomenal and extremely beautiful. This show has the perfect mix of comedy, satire, and amazing attention to detail and astounding character depth and development. I've watched it all the way through at least 5 times and plan to keep adding to that number I've never power watched 5 seasons of a cartoon in my life.
I've also never had a cartoon have so much raw emotions!
I laughed, I felt depressed, I felt pain, & I loved all of it.
One of the greatest written cartoons I've ever watched!
Please don't ever stop making this cartoon. The perfect blend of thought provoking and humorous. This is a true masterclass in animated comedy Started so funny and it obviously treated BoJack's issues, but then... It got deep. The season 5 finale was so sad! It's definitely one of the best shows I've watched. Can't wait for season 6! I just loved it because of the animation. Great voice acting hope it does not cancel..... 10/10 There is so much to be said about this series, which won't fit all in a summarized content without compromising its dark beauty. However, this is basically the quote "life imitates art far more than art imitates life" in action.<br/><br/>You like dark comedy? It's all here. You don't? It'll grow on you eventually. Tongue twisters? Show has it. Are you old enough to grasp the concept and teachings of existential philosophy? This is it but displayed in an easier to understand, twisted, relatable version. You don't really like 'cartoons'? Give this show a shot anyway, it most likely will turn your opinion around.<br/><br/>All you've got to do is read the premise of the show and watch yourself go through a life defining experience and see what the show has to offer about the omniprescence of existentialism in Bojack's (as well as our) lives despite all the mundane things we do on a daily basis. A beautifully animated, written and acted series of television. One of, if not the best TV show ever created. It's back with its self deprecating wit and charm with a main character that's painfully easy to project your bad feeling onto. i can only fault it for once again asking the big questions about depression and self destructive natures, only to not offer any real answers. That however doesn't make it any less enjoyable to watch in the moment Holden Caulfield. Huckleberry Finn. Scarlet O'Hara. Scout Finch. Tom Joad. These are an all too short list of some of the great characters in American Literature. <br/><br/>And now we have Bojack Horseman.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman is a great show, but that doesn't do it any justice. It goes beyond that. Bojack Horseman The Series is one of the great literary stories of our time. Don't let the talking animals and slapstick fool you, those are merely trappings. We start with silly jokes, characters snipping at one another, ridiculous sitcom situations, but the overall story wins out in the end as we are presented with 'moments' that make a paradigm shift in the lives of the characters. This happens several times in all three seasons.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman The Character is a flawed protagonist. Like so many of us, he has strengths, but his failings overpower those. He constantly sabotages himself with poor decisions and gives in to temptation all too easily. He hurts the people that care about him, but he genuinely wants to do and be better. <br/><br/>This is the struggle that defines the series. This is the struggle that transcends the sitcom trappings. This is the struggle that makes this series literature. <br/><br/>This is what we see in ourselves, the art that makes us look at ourselves in a new light. The fact that they managed to wrap it into an obscene cartoon with talking animals only makes it better. I never write reviews, but this show urges me to do so. It is complete in all its facets. One moment I am rolling on the ground, laughing (this happened literally), another moment I am moved to tears (figuratively, tears never seemed like my thing). Most of all, I am hopeful for Bojack and the next moment desperate or disillusioned. The book about Bojack in the series is a metaphor for the series itself: by showing Bojack's flaws, motives and reasoning, the series connects very deeply with the viewer. Tragicomical!<br/><br/>"Well, That's the problem with life, right? Either you know what you want, and then you don't get what you want. Or you get what you want, and then you don't know what you want." Hey Guys RegularShow1 here again and today I'm going to review the "Netflix" Original series "BoJack Horseman". The show is about a TV star named "Bojack Horseman" who used to be on a sitcom on TV called "Horsin' Around". But Today he is a washed up celebrity from 1990s live Hollywood, CA with Todd Chavez who is a slacker that ends up living with "Bojack". Then there Diane Nuguyen who is a ghostwriter for "Bojack". The show is satire on Hollywood. The show started streaming on "Netflix" on August 22,2014 with it second season on July 17,2015.I recently started watching it and like it. Anyway I highly recommend this show. Anyway I'm giving "Bojack Horseman" a 10 out of 10 stars. See You Later. BYE. This show was recommend by a friend of mine. He told me how great the writing and depth was in the show. He was absolutely right! Thanks pudd. The show looks great too, there was a lot of money put into the show and the characters all have their personality. Jordan also recommended the show because there are so many different voices who all add new dimensions to the show, so many dimensions even that it goes beyond our very understanding! The jokes never get old in the show and tend to have my sides splitting. Jordan and I were in tears because Bojack just can't catch a break! At first glance, you may not want to give the show a chance, but it is definitely worth watching the whole series.. like Jordan Joseph Smith and I did. He even bought bought a sweet shirt and Pink Penguin shoes cause he loves the show so much. I am disappointed there is not a single negative review for this poorly drawn, overrated cartoon.<br/><br/>This show takes itself way too seriously for a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse. It has its moments, but it's just predictable tropes about 80's sitcoms and show-business thrown together. It all comes across as rather pretentious, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>So far I have seen almost all of season one... The end of the season devolves as it becomes all about some meaningless love-triangle. I mean, I do not understand how the viewer could be invested in the main character getting with his love interest when they openly admit he's a terrible person who doesn't really love anyone.<br/><br/>When you get down to it, this show is about some rich dude with no real problems who is depressed and sardonic all the time. Maybe I'm just too uncool to like that kind of thing, but what a buzz-kill!<br/><br/>The show is watchable mostly because there is an overarching story line, I must admit I was at least drawn in enough to at least see what happens next. Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows to have been aired in a long time. Watch if your looking for something to binge Proclaimer: This series ended a few days ago and I didn't start rewatching the whole series yet to get a better in-depth look, so maybe my opinion changes later on<br/><br/>For people who are new to the series: I won't tell you what is great about this series (there are plenty enough of those reviews here) and you should figure it out yourself. But I urge you to try, start/keep watching it and not read any further.<br/><br/>I consider this series to be one of the best (if not the best so far) I've ever seen. Of course there are series out there which could compete with the quality of this one (in its own way), but they often have major flaws throughout the plots.<br/><br/>They often end up getting a 9/10 from me. Like, Breaking Bad for example (also starring Aaron Paul), was great till the last season. The plot of Todd's Nazi family (BB's Todd, not to mix up with Bojack's Todd) was too cheap.<br/><br/>So I tried really hard to remember and think of any major flaws, which may occur in BoJack Horseman. The best I could come up with is the "Todd-Quirkness". You know, this classic Todd situations and adventures, where things run an unbelievable path or wouldn't turn out that way in reality.<br/><br/>It becomes a trademark for the series itself, and they started to spread it out to almost every character, like "Okay, we have a P.C. story plot here. How can we add some quirky, irrational trait in this scenario". For the most part it is okay for Todd and fine in small doses for other characters, but it starts to get old fast, when (a) whole character(s) becomes simply "Todd-quirky", as it was in the case of Paige & Max (the old-timey reporter detectives) in S06. God, I found them annoying. And I'm curious, if this will age well all together.<br/><br/>How a series turns out like, which is almost entirely "Todd-quirky", you can clearly see in "Tuca & Bertie", also animated (and created) by Lisa Hanawalt, which was way over the top, most of the time.<br/><br/>But I wouldn't say that this is a major dealbreaker for BoJack Horseman. I am always impressed how they manage to give us such realistic character features and depressing stories not leading us abandoning it all together, rather keep us all interested and sympathize with the characters. Furthermore helping us, to cope with our problems better in real life.<br/><br/>So, there you have it. In my opinion a well deserved 10/10 I don't have words to describe how wonderful this show is. Makes you cry, and feels real. Bojack is a horse, but it feels so human. 10/10. "Bojack Horseman" came into my Netflix suggestions randomly. Well a TV series about an animated talking horse I didn't expect much out of it and ignored it for many days! I still don't understand why enough people don't know about this series and why it hasn't won a God Damn Emmy yet!!<br/><br/>It is carefully crafted brilliance portrayed into an incredibly imaginative script full of puns and surprising humor!! It presses where it hurts! Few of the scenes haunt you for days!<br/><br/>I created an IMDb account just to write a review for this series
So in short my message to those who haven't seen it yet<br/><br/>"Dear viewers, Hello! This is a letter, Bojack Horseman is making me write a letter because I guess letter writing is therapeutic, I heard it did wonders for Bojack Horseman in rehab! Anyways! Bojack is going just fine!!
God Damn It!!..I'll cut right to the chase, everytime I end up watching a season it makes me think about my own progress! I spent years being miserable thinking that was the only way to be..the main thing I think about is how stupid I was I didn't do it sooner!! Anyways what's up with you??.....just kidding you can't say anything this is a letterðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬" I'm a major depressive disorder patient, this show started funny for me, with a few episodes made me even sadder and more depressed. But when I finished all six, I find lots of comfort and hope of seeing oneself that's destroyed like BoJack but also able to find his way out, to save himself. I find comfort and courage in this show, really, giving me hope of everything will work out at the end. This Netflix-produced cartoon series uses animation, anthropomorphic characters and running jokes to veil its far darker, far more serious tones of substance abuse and the derailing effects of fame. Lead by Will Arnett (Arrested Development) as the titular Bojack (a fading 80s television star), Bojack Horseman documents how Arnett's character, regardless of how famous or successful he is, cannot seem to be happy. Alongside this, his deteriorating relationships with those few that care about him takes their toll, and the character development is crucial to what makes this show so watchable.<br/><br/>At points, this show can be guilty of meandering: some mid-season episodes lose sight of the overall storyline, and there are certain characters afforded more screen time than maybe they should have been. However, the overall plot builds and delivers consistently, with the poignant final scenes of both seasons 1 and 2 being some of my favourites in television. There is definitely some good humour in Bojack, but to me it becomes secondary to the grief and distress illustrated. Every time you feel as if someone is succeeding in improving themselves, a new development or a relapse of some variety will restore their vicious habits, and the cycle begins again. You really empathise with the cast - even though you know that really you shouldn't.<br/><br/>Arnett isn't the only talent on show: Amy Sedaris (Elf), Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) and Alison Brie (Community) are all heavily featured, each with their own character flaws and foibles that set them out from other typical roles you see on the small screen. The voice acting and accompanying musical score are both elite, but don't end up distracting from the nuances of the story. Numerous guest appearances are scattered around the episodes (giving the "Hollywood" image more colour), with some included almost solely for a name-based pun.<br/><br/>Bojack's story may start slow, but it is infectious - you want to see if he manages to rid himself of the rot, or if his own destructive habits will slowly destroy him from within. On top of this, there is the constant threat that those closest to Bojack may become secondary casualties in his own personal battle. If you start this show, persevere; the final 6 episodes are being released on the morning of 2020, so now is the perfect time to commit to this rare instance of a Netflix adaptation worth your while. You've probably glossed over this show while browsing Netflix thinking it's just another Family Guy, and that's just what the creators want you to think. I went into this show thinking the same thing and I was blown away. BoJack Horseman is the only show I've ever cried to, the silly cartoon about a horse in Hollywoo(d), which is a huge testament to how well-written it is. Reminds me of two and a half man, its smart written, great story. BoJack is a jackpot character, huge charisma, drama and comedy combined. I think he is actually great guy/horse that is much misunderstood. I kinda mindlessly watched through the first season and a half or 2, but then wow it started to actually get real funny and surprising. I like it! I mean come on, the writing is fantastic and engaging and frigging hilarious. Stick with it and it gets better and better as you get to know BoJack..you can actually relate if you've lived in SoCal too I'm completely unable to fault this show for what it is. BoJack is the embodiment of the negative traits that most people can relate to, and the other characters are terrifically important to the show as well. I didn't know that an animated show about a depressed horse with strong themes of existential nihilism would totally floor me, but here we are. The first season especially critiques Hollywood thoroughly without rambling on and on. Life has no purpose, and we're left to our devices to distract us from this crushing sense of our own insignificance. We often catch ourselves in cycles of finding ourselves, making friends in our sadness, losing them or pushing them away, and repeating this ad nauseam. Some people hide their brokenness better than others, and sometimes succeed in life for absolutely no merit of their own. This show doesn't offer a succinct answer to life's dilemma of existence, but I think just prodding the viewer to think about it helps in it's own way.<br/><br/>In short, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll think, and you'll be hit with a semi truck filled with emotions. If you've ever been depressed or lost, I can almost guarantee this show will speak to you every few episodes. This is my favorite show that's still running. I will add one caveat, though.<br/><br/>If you're in a really dark place right this minute, I don't think I can recommend it to you. While it could be encouraging to see that other people suffer in a similar way, I could also imagine that this could make you feel worse.<br/><br/>The only critique I have is that the art style isn't really my cup of tea, but that's subjective. I love this series. I did not see that coming... <br/><br/>It took some time to get into it, and a few attempts. I mistakenly took it for just another dumb cartoony thing. I started watching it even though I felt the market is slightly oversaturated with animated shows... they're all "oh so funny and oh so mad" and quite frankly - many shows bore me nowdays! But suddenly I realised I had binge watched Bojack Horseman on Netflix, and that I COULD NOT WAIT (yup that statement needed caps!) to get started on the next season. Why? I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>Bojack is different. Very different. It builds up to things you do not see coming. It is dark. And it gets darker each season. It is anything but PC. But maybe because it comments on real life. Real mistakes. So what Bojack is a washed up celebrity with drug and alcohol problems, I can still relate to some of his madness. The series fixates on anxiety and the ghosts many of us carry within us. It comments on popular culture and crazy obsessions. The characters might be a loopy mixture of animals, but that adds comedy and charm. <br/><br/>Stick with it for a few episodes. It is not uplifting or always fun to watch, often it is the opposite. But it is rather brilliant. People should give this a go. (Minor spoilers.... I guess) Only reason that this is a 9 is because of the first six episodes. The first six are not great but after that the show brings you into the mind of a Hollywood star who has everything but happiness. He suffers from depression, and he feels he has done nothing with his life. In some parts of the show it has brought me close to tears because of how much you sympathize and care for BoJack. All in all its a great show and worth your time. I am not sentimental but Bojack is series that is able to deliver laughs but also get extremely heavy.<br/><br/>This show is not for stupid people.<br/><br/>While the central whirligig is an anthropomorphic horse, this is not Family Guy or American Dad, this is an absurdist comedy with more in common with Louis, Archer or Rick and Morty. Forget cartoons, this show is as heavy as any drama out there. It has a boatload of sardonic jokes and self deprecating meta gags, but it'll also turn on a dime and get extremely heavy extremely quickly. I'm not ashamed to say that at certain points the show was actually able to bring me to tears for brief moments as it descends from comedy into serious topics such as depression, self loathing, terminal illness and horrifying childhoods.<br/><br/>The main character, Bojack Horseman, comes off as an unlikeable and deplorable rake, the show then reveals a flashback to his childhood that immediately brings one to tears. The show will cast you from his heyday (no pun intended) in the 1990s as a good hearted and jovial star of a stereotypical 90s sitcom into the present day maelstrom of alcoholism and depression, beaten down by cynicism, betrayal, circumstance and inadvertent self destruction. <br/><br/>I haven't seen anything like this in a long time. I dare you to watch this. I love the show not just because it's funny, but because it sets itself apart from all the other adult comedy shows out there. I enjoy watching Family Guy and American Dad, but the humor in those shows all revolves around stereotypes and sexism and is often borderline offensive. I love how Bojack Horseman is different in that way. The script is well written, the casting is pretty amazing, and there's actually a plot that links the story throughout. watching Bojack Horseman you won't have to feel guilty about laughing at a sexist joke because there are none, and I'm so glad that there's an adult comedy that doesn't base itself on offensive humor, and manages to be pretty profound. This show is honestly amazing. They are extremely clever and there is in fact a true meaning to the story, and that is what really sets it apart. The first half of season one was pointless comedy, but soon it hit its stride and had a real drama-comedy feel to it. It is hard to take cartoons as a serious drama as there pretty much are zero out there like that, but this really does well. Especially since the last 6-8 minutes or so are usually devoted to the serious side of the show, The best part is we can all binge watch on Netflix rather than waiting weekly. Will Arnett is great, and Aaron Paul just compliments him perfectly, he is hilarious as well. Once you start to watch a few episodes you get hooked and you see how truly spectacular this show is. Bojack Horseman mixes the strange, the surreal and fantastic comedy with it's own thought provoking and satirical look at modern day celebrity obsession culture.<br/><br/>It's easy to watch and you can turn your brain off if wanted, enjoying the funny story lines. Repeat watching doesn't diminish it, and it's full of brilliant little references (watch out for the news ticker tapes they do!) and continuing jokes not only throughout the series but the entire thing.<br/><br/>It sounds strange to say but Bojack Horseman also contains some great relatable lessons and events. It's cringe worthy to see the way Bojack deals with some of his situations, but he's always trying to do the best thing, even if it isn't what everyone else thinks! It's a true joy to watch, and having just watched the entire second season I believe thats been even better than the first. Character and story development continues and never seems out of place or character. Filled with charming and clever jokes, references and stories this is Netflix's best original series. Will Arnet as the voice of Bojack is fantastic and truly makes the character. Delivering a message is not an easy thing when the premise of your own work is a talking anthropomorphic horse that is an actor. But the twelve episodes delivered by this series actually convey a message that is shown in the whole conjecture of the show. No one is perfect. In fact, we are all far from being so. So far in fact, that what this flick has done at it's core: It is not a perfect series, and it's characters are not perfect. The whole set-up is flawed to hell. But no one will ever question it, because it's it's way. There is a special phrase that I will always cherish, for more cynical it can be, being "I got hurt because I thought you could become good, instead of remembering that you are bad, and not get hurt when you do this things." And that touches. It's a simple line that hurts bad, and can trigger an emotional cry. The ending is a masterpiece, something that I love in any ending. Showing a real life scenario with animal headed humans that actually depicts our reality at it's core. I love this show, and I don't care if they plan another season, cause I know I won't be disappointed. A lot of people said this show got dark, But watching the first few episodes I couldn't have imagined where it would go. It's definitely dark, But also kinda beautiful and perfect. I laughed, I cried, I contemplated my mortality and the meaninglessness of life.<br/><br/>This show has everything, And it's execution is just right. It felt complete, And I'm somewhat nervous about the next season. Rarely does quality like that stay consistent.<br/><br/>This is one of those shows that you have to watch at least once in your life, It's not a masterpiece but I swear it's a hell of a lot better than most things out there, And maybe you might just walk away with a different perspective or at the very least, Some self-reflection. For the most part comedies frustrate me. As a viewer I'm tired of watching two dimensional characters entangled in one dimensional plot lines. These types of 'funnies' lack the depth and intrigue to captivate or exceed their seriality. Instead, we get a healthy dose of the same overblown animated series till the show has been milked 10 years past its prime. Bojack Horseman is different to that tragic trend in many ways. Its not a comedy that holds that your hand and try's reassuring you that it will always spoon feed you a healthy dose of humor. Instead, it provides uncomfortably real characters in the most surreal way. Bojack's satire of Hollywood is spot-on, and as a comedy it delivers a continuous, quite sense of amusement (thats not to say that it doesn't have spectacularly over the top moments of humor). The characters are never two dimensional, and there always seems to be something dark or difficult looming beneath their animated fur. Very few shows seem to tackle self-loathing, or the chief existential questions quite like Bojack.<br/><br/>I have watched the first season 3 times now, and I find myself feeling desperate for more. This show explores very deep and realistic topics like no other show that I have seen before, this show probably has the best ending any show has ever had, besides breaking bad. This show will make you laugh, cry and at times punch you really hard in the gut. I know I'm not doing the show justice with my words, but please go see this show, and I hope it changes you as much as it changed me. I can't really put how grateful I am in words.
Thanks to the team that made this possible, none of this show is profane.
Every element is in adequate amount, nothing much or less.
I did have good laughters and tears. I can only imagine how hard it must be to make a tv show. But it must be even harder to end it. THE BEST ENDING TO A SERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN!
And I'm only 36 yeas old... Some people might get off by the animated series 8th talking animals and somewhat very childisb subplots but nce you get past those initial few episodes and get on with what what's the show really wants to say - the series goes on another level. Its satire on real world issues and problems on masculinity, celebrity powers etc are too well handled under the drapes of comedy. It takes everything head on and huge issues are said like a matter of fact. Some of the episodes are visual masterpiece too. The way internal conflict and emotions are shown of everyone is ingenious and never been done before. After completing all the seasons I will say its a journey of 6 seasons with the shows where you go up and down with all the characters. Its a master piece. Episodes like - Ruthie, free churro, halfway down etc deserve their place to be one of the best in all TV categories One of the best shows I've ever seen. I totally recommend it. I guess Bojack was the most beautiful series I have watched This show takes you to a journey and the truth is I enjoyed every part of it! Watching Bojack's life allow you to experience any kind of emotion thanks to deep characters, a marvelous storytelling and brilliant directing.<br/><br/>At first sight,it is only about crazy characters with funny lines enjoying drugs and alcohol in Hollywood but it's not. Early on, even it's a great comedy show, you can notice that behind the jokes, characters are more human than ever. This show will definitly break your heart just after some random hilarious line.
In addition, I've never seen a show describing mental issues like that. Feelings such as depression, loneliness or friendship are brightly dissected to depict how life can be.
Finally, animation and acting are great so is the showrunners' creativity. All of that combined leads each season to some mindblowing episodes.<br/><br/>Please, don't give up after the first episodes. it gets better as you get to know Bojack and his friends. Get comfortable and enjoy the trip, it's definitly worth a watch! Sigh. What a phenomenal show. Hits too close to home. Relatable AF. Dark, super intelligent, intense and yet hilarious. Epic is the only word that comes to mind. For years I saw Bojack Horseman in the netflix menu and always just assumed it was gonna be another edgy-comical adult cartoon. And while the first few episodes certainly look like that, they are interesting and fresh enough to keep you watching and the reward is immeasurable. Some of the episodes could stand alone as award winning shortfilms, this show has touched and moved me like no other form of art ever had. It even feels too personal at times to recommend to friends. This show portrays all sorts of stuff you don't expect from it at first sight, like addiction, depression, existentialism,...<br/><br/>If you are reading this review without having seen the show, I urge you to start watching it now with all my heart This show made me sign up for imdb because I can't not write a review.<br/><br/>Despite the craziness of half-human half-animal characters, this is one of the most realistic and hard-hitting shows ever made. While this show highlights flaws, it does not glorify them. It talks about consequences and responsibility, joy engulfed in sadness and how you can never just get rid of the past without actually dealing with it. It doesn't get more real than this. It's not preachy, just a great reflection of what life is.<br/><br/>Will Arnett is BEYOND brilliant and adds so much life to Bojack. I had goosebumps every second episode because of the way he delivered some hard and gritty dialogues. I know so many people who discontinued watching the show after the first 2-3 episodes. I would REALLY recommend you watch it end to end because you will not regret it. TV shows like that are rare, it is even rarer that it comes in the format fo a talking horse. When you first tell people about Bojack Horseman, who never watched it, it sounds like a bad joke. It goes to show that these same people would then continue binging four seasons in two weeks.
Gone are the days that people belittled animated TV shows, they are not merely kids entertainment now, but a new way to tackle complex themes. I am not here to give a exhaustive list of all the themes that are tackled in Bojack and this has been done better by others anyways, buit it is genuinely one of the best TV shows about Depression and Mental Health.
But while there are a lot of gut wrenching episodes that might hit too close to home for some it still remains genuinely funny. There are lots great written jokes and hidden things that you might just notice the second or third time, adding to the rewatchability.
While the first season takes some time to know where it wants to go, in my opinion from season 2 onwards it achieves a high standard and manages to maintain that until the end.<br/><br/>It is TV at its best and I don't think we will see something quite like it for a while. I was mad and confused when I saw the finale. I'm used to untied endings but this was harder to swallow because it's very real, life sucks sometimes and this show is the perfect showcase for it, beautiful masterpiece No words, best TV Show ever.
10/10, just WATCH IT! Often saw this recommendation several times but I thought it seemed like a silly cartoon but because of the good rating I tried to watch it and it turned out to be very good! When I see there are six seasons and quite a lot of episodes I am very happy, but when I finish I feel less! After some disappointing first episodes, this TV show really picked up with the last-first-season episodes and definitely surprised me. This TV show is really one of a kind and really got more funny and well written as it went on. The characters had a surprising amount of depth and the animation also just got better and better. Please watch. I can't describe how Bojack Horseman is so important to me. Literally I'd watched a lot of series, but this one touched my heart in a different way. I feel so related to the emotions and quotes of the show. Definitely is a must watch.
10/10 If anyone reading this review, just watch the show. She's tough, funny, and just play on all your emotional spectrum - i loughed, i cried, i was uncomfortable, happy. This show was absolutly a 10 for me. I never thought it's possible to connect with animated characters as much as I did during those 6 seasons. I never thought I'd enjoy a horse ranting for 20 straight minutes or laugh hysterically at lame pop culture references as far as cry for hours after watching the last episode . Who would have thought that a show about an anthropomorphic horse set in Hollywood would be one of the most human shows ever made. That was what Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed with BoJack Horseman. It's a show that's hilarious and dramatic, satirical and tragic as we follow BoJack Horseman and his friends through the trials of life. The show could be nilhilistic and the characters could be prophetic about their own destinies *couch* Sarah-Lynn *couch.* BoJack Horseman offers up on the best portraits on issues like mental health and addiction and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This makes the show so relatable and lets it stand out. Never wrote a review anywhere before this because I feel like it's not worth wasting my time. But wow.. this show made me feel happy, sad, and deeply disturbing at the same time.<br/><br/>It's not just another animated adult comedy show, it's life. I cannot express how I felt after I finished watching the last episode. It was a fine ending to one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. What made me sad is that both BoJack and Diane love and care for each other but never got to express their feelings. I would've loved it even more if BoJack told Diane that he stole the "D" from "Hollywoo" for her at the very end.<br/><br/>Thank you, BoJack Horseman..!! This is a show in which the viewer can easily get lost in all the introspective and depth of the characters. If you're an emotional person, this will, undoubtedly, make you feel lots of things. This is probably the most well-written adult cartoon-like show. Season 4, Episode 7 or "Underground" is a flamingly funny example of today's political musings. The debacle we call the trump virus today, is typical crowd mentality. We are so sure of ourselves in these times, we are willing to sacrifice each other to The Orange Popsicle God, instead of loving each other unconditionally and without prejudice. Think on that america! Think on that? Murf Bojack Horseman tricked me. I started watching it with little hope that it would go near the status of other adult, edgy cartoons I love - South Park and Family Guy. It has absolutely nothing to do with those two titles. It's a very distinct type of TV altogether.<br/><br/>If you stick around for the first season, you'll have no choice but to become emotionally attached to these characters. And then, you are served with one of the deepest dives into depression, addiction and struggles of making it into show business.
All on the back of a life of a failed actor still living off of the success of a TV show he starred in back in the 90's. With the minor detail that he is a talking horse.<br/><br/>It amazes me how a show about anthropomorphic animals made me feel and think so much more about life than 90% of the shows I have watched. And it nails that because of how believable its character development really is. Because of how truthful these character's struggles come across. Which I can only attribute to absolutely genius writing. There are no obvious happy endings. Just an ending. And guess what? That's infinity more relatable.<br/><br/>If you are looking to make you laugh all the time - I don't think Bojack Horseman is the best show out there. Aside from Bojack's sarcasm and Todd's antics, there's not a lot in this series that made me actually laugh out loud. Even the (I imagine successful) running gags like the animal puns or Princess Carolyn's alliterations aren't particularly funny to me.<br/><br/>Still, I stuck around. And I did because I became incredibly involved in these character's fate. I stopped seeing them as animals. It's just a minor detail in the show's plot.<br/><br/>Not only is the writing genius, it is incredibly innovative.
There's an episode which is a 25 minute monologue of the title character. And I wasn't distracted for 2 seconds. There's another set under water which has no dialogue for 70% of it. This show was not afraid to do things differently. And I am really glad it saw the light of day nonetheless. Especially because I cannot find anything like it out there.<br/><br/>I am giving it a 9, not 10. Not sure why. But it surely made me go back and downgrade a lot of 9s to 8s for other TV shows. Because this brilliant show did not seize to surprise me at every turn. One of the best shows I've ever seen. Sometimes a bit cringy, but deals with real problems. Connecting with problems of the main character, making us realise that our deepest fears in life are actually not ours alone. This show brings a whole new perspective on animation world. And the level of recognising our everyday issues increases with more episodes. You gotta love BoJack and his twisted character! This tv series it's one of the beautiful series of all time, it's perfect! In a world populated by both people and anthropomorphic animals, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Arrested Development and SNL's Will Arnett) follows the life of the titular horse, a former sitcom star. Bojack isn't the best person and has a lot of emotional and mental issues. I loved this show and consider it one of the best adult animated programs of all time.<br/><br/>This dark comedy is an excellent analysis of human nature, mental health, and the question of redemption. Be prepared that Bojack really does some awful things, though the show wisely paces them out. Yet, the show also manages to make you feel for Bojack. To clarify, the show never validates his actions. In fact, there is self-criticism of the its own anti-hero genre. The writing, characterization, and use of continuity in this show is EXCELLENT.<br/><br/>Though the last paragraph makes this sound super dramatic, there's plenty of comedy and it's really, really funny. There is some really cutting satire of Hollywood and showbusiness. The show does a good job of balancing the darker aspects with lighter stuff. Bojack's goofy, carefree longtime house guest Todd (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) is a great balance with his wacky misadventures.<br/><br/>Also, this is that rare show that never drops a beat. All six seasons are quality, including the last one whose cancellation was sudden.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this enough. This show is pure genius. This show is amazing it is probably one of the best shows I have ever seen. I would often finish an episode of Bojack with a feeling that another layer of my soul had just been uncovered.
"Why am i feeling this way at a cartoon?"<br/><br/>I, like many viewers no doubt, are desperate for others unawares to give this show a try because although it is often laugh out loud, the show is nothing short of being revolutionary tv, addressing very relatable and often uncomfortably raw issues often swept under the carpet in the real world. I wish they could have stopped at S06E15. I do understand that they wanted to leave a door open for a possible return but come on guys. "The View from Halfway Down" is a perfect end it's like All That Jazz. A perfect Dance of Death. If we really need a "what happen with the others" episode I'm pretty sure that a BoJack funeral would provide a good basis for that. Like "Still Broken" (and "Free Churro" was brilliant). Now that this show ended, going back and rewatching the episodes from the beginning is incredible. There are so many hidden details that predict the ending that go all the way back to season 1. The emotional bond you form with these characters is one like no other. This show is truly amazing and I can't recommend it enough. I started watching the fist episode this show out of curiosity and with no expectations. Automatically I kept watching all weekend and without any intent I binge-watched the hell of season one. I got hooked from that day on. BoJack is a show extremelly well crafted. It takes you along for a ride full of highs, lows and lowers of very a very diverse and human group of characters, that you cannot help but feel sympathetic for. For me, this is possibly the best "TV" show of the last decade. Perhaps I'm mistaken. (From experience, I'm not good at accurately distinguishing faces.) But it gave me a quite different - sadder, truer, touching - take on the ending from what I've been reading on the net.<br/><br/>I rewatched the complete season before alowing myself to read anyone else's take. and something Zach Braff says about loss when he's compering in the penultimate episode chimes with what I thought I saw.<br/><br/>Often when you know someone (who is gone) so well, that you have conversations with them, because you know exactly what they would say to everything you say. Of course PC would dance with Bojack at her wedding, Todd would be on his shoulders at the beach (and Bojack would say 'wait, why are you on my shoulders?'), and Diane would talk to Bojack on the roof. Animated TV-series tend to do a bit of the same, and almost makes it's own genre. But this show absolutely breaks that thought. Bojack horseman drags you into the universe of more than just an animated show. It leaves you with deep thoughts. It's really the end of an era for TV with BoJack Horseman ending. Say what you will about the art style and the stiff animation, that's an easy target. It's the writing that leaves a brutal impact, exploring depression, addiction, trauma and ambition and the self-destructive behavior associated with them that effects your family, career and social life. No character is perfect, which is what makes them interesting and relatable to the core.<br/><br/>The harsh realities this show presents are haunting because they can very easily happen to anyone - not just celebrities, who are people, too. BoJack is also really smart with its use of language, upping the ferocity only when a character permanently damages a relationship with another and it makes those individual moments stand out intensely, as opposed to other shows that just loosely spews coarse language without any regard of their unique effect. For a show featuring many anthropomorphic animals, it's surprisingly human. Put up with the formulaic first season, I promise it gets better. The whole series has been amazing, and it's a shame it had to come to an end. However, it was given a brilliant ending, with two perfect final episodes The character development is just too much man! It's amazing! And the tiny little details in every single episode which makes the large picture. The series are really, really really beautiful. There is a real story line behind this show. It's not only funny but serious which is hard to do for a cartoon show. The characters are fantastic - all around a great show I really like this title, because of what it means to me when i watch it. Much like when bojack watches his own show "Horsin'around" i feel a good feeling when i watch this show, for the duration of the show. 
There are a lot of things that i like about this show, such as the continuity and the ever misterious universe that the show is set in. But, really doe how cool isn't it that the there are different animal species as the people who live in this world. 
I am really a hugh fan of this consept and the show, full score from my end. <br/><br/>PS: And another reason why i like it is because it shares so many similarities with Californication :) Bojack Horseman is a fantastic animated comedy. Eagerly awaiting another season. This review is for season 1:<br/><br/>Having watched outstanding and amazingly addictive animated shows such as "Rick and Morty" or "Archer" who not only surpass most of the modern live action TV series but also, set a standard for series to come, I was very skeptical about Bojack Horseman. Having seen 2 episodes, all I thought was that: I just threw away an hour of my life. Everyone told me to continue watching and that season 1 is just a set up. I do not support this kind of shows because whenever I'm watching a show I'm investing time in it and sometimes no matter how good the TV series gets later I feel deeply unsatisfied with my spent time. This is not the case with this season <br/><br/>Bojack Horseman season 1 explores the daily life of Bojack Horseman, who is also a horse, and some of his so called "friends". Bojack is an actor who was the main star of "horsing around" a popular sitcom show in the 90s. Now, he is out of a job, nobody wants to hire him and life is quite bad in general. The main story of this season is Bojack trying to get his career back on track by writing a book about himself or at least trying to do so. <br/><br/>Bojack is not a typical protagonist of a comedy show however, this Netflix original is not really a comedy as well. I would consider it more of a drama. Despite Bojack's fame his flaws make him as relatable as it is possible for a horse living in "Hollywoo". Will Arnett creates a multilayered charter that not only keeps your attention but also stays in your head for long after you finished watching an episode. Bojack is cool but, Todd was always the stand out for me personally. I will forever remember Aaron Paul screaming "Yay responsibility" or the image of Todd's hat while he is wearing a tux. The rest of the cast is amazing in their roles and have completely dissolved in their characters. Despite the fact that they live in the world inhabited not only by humans but human- like animals (the issue of eating meat (in fact chicken) is addressed) they all seem strangely real and "human". <br/><br/>As I have already said this show is not really a comedy. I can't say that I didn't' burst out laughing every 10 mins of the show (roughly twice per episode) but the fact that it also made me almost depressed at times, had a greater impact. It is true that it is a dark satire of life in Hollywood and that it raises some of interesting themes in that part of show but if you dig into it you will find much more. Ultimately its an exploration of depression and meaningless of life. It is mentioned too often in the show to not realise that the theme is present there. Depression however, is harder to pin point. Well that is until episode 8. Episode 8 hits you hard. It does not gently ease you into understanding of Bojack's life but instead, it punches you in the face with it. On top of that it was roughly the time when I started to understand the meaning of the opening credits <br/><br/>The opening credits deserve a separate review. Yes they are that good. We see Bojack following his monotonous struggle though the day with ending the cycle by falling into a pool which is a metaphor for him giving in to the depression that he has. Fantastic fixed camera shows us his face and almost makes us fell as if we are Bojack ourselves. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that this show is very thought provoking and very dark, I still find that I am able to enjoy it as much as other comedies before it. During my time with "Scrubs" or "Community" I always felt at ease with the characters on the screen no matter what the plot was. I am glad to say that I have found another show that has characters that I am so attached to and more importantly can relate to. In the end its still a show about a horse living in Hollywood even though its probably the smartest show right now. I'm just going to say in resume my experience with the series.<br/><br/>I saw people talking about it, about how it is one more of those adult TV shows that are really awesome but I don't watch too much cartoons, so I just keep on missing them... So, I thought about giving this one a shot because a friend of mine recommended and I had just finished Rick & Morty and I NEEDED something similar to replace it.<br/><br/>I didn't expect too much of it because the premise wasn't THAT awesome at first, but after the pilot episode, I just got a bit hooked. And while I was watching it more and more, I realized how funny, deep, sad and satirical it was. I absolutely loved the two first seasons I saw. The characters, the story, the comedy, the drama, and even the cinematography was enjoyable, something that I didn't see that much in this kind of show.<br/><br/>If I had any problem with the series, is that the dramatic timing sometimes feel off. Don't get me wrong, some episodes are REALLY tense, melancholic or just sentimental, but occasionally a shot could last longer, so that the viewer can feel more of the character's emotion in the scene. I noticed that in a lot of episodes, and it is just a little detail that could be worked on, after all, it's awesome just to have scenes like this in a animated "comedy" show from Netflix. Another point is just that the animation can be a little weird from time to time. That's also not really frequent and it's just a detail that could actually be purposeful, but it still bothered me.<br/><br/>And that's it. BoJack Horseman is this series that just surprised me and gave me some really good reflections on some stuff. I wasn't expecting that because it was just so underrated. I really think it could have better attention, it deserves it. And if you like other series, like Family Guy, South Park, or even Rick and Morty, as I mentioned, you should definitely give this one a try. This show manages to be deep, profound, funny, absurd, dark, depressing, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable all at once. Not for those who are looking for another adult cartoon like Family Guy or Bob's Burgers. While this show rivals those shows in the humor department, it far surpasses them in the quality of writing and emotional impact. BoJack Horseman has a nice premise (and some clever characters), but the show's sad scenes, and plots are tarnished by the fact the almost every episode ends with a few sad scenes (the show loses it's sense of emotional attachment). That also creates a very repetitive feel. .... ...... The show is about a famous washed-up actor that just so happens to be a horse blah blah blah...<br/><br/>This show is not about BoJack Horseman, it's not about the film industry, it's not about L.A., it's not about depression, it's not about loneliness. It's about you. It's about you, and the happy bubble you lived/live in. What is a happy bubble you say? Your lucky day! You found a great show to watch. Go ahead, it's on Netflix. Are you capable of thinking? I am sorry, this show is not for you.<br/><br/>Although I am rating it a 1 star out of 10, I am not really sure if this show is genius or... the complete opposite of genius. This is because I cannot tell if the show is made for an audience that are the complete opposite of geniuses, or if it is made by the complete opposite of geniuses. The show is written in a way that is supposed to make us reflect on happiness. Its use of music, montages, and monologues through the episode tell us that when the episode ends, we should feel completely "mind blown". But nothing we are shown is actually "mind-blowing". It's repetitive, boring, and predictable. This is because the creators appear to be stuck in a creative loop: take a quality that people think makes you happy (fame/luck/love), then twist it so that it does not bring happiness to the characters in the show. MIND BLOWN! This show is not supposed to be a sitcom and yet, this is basically how all sitcoms are written. The only difference between this show and any other sitcom is that sitcoms are generally funny. BoJack Horseman just fetishizes sadness.<br/><br/>No matter where you believe happiness comes from: fame (BoJack Horseman), intelligence (Diane Nguyen), hard work (Princess Carolyn), luck (Mr. Peanutbutter), drugs (Sarah Lynn), reconciling with friends (Herb Kazzaz), confessing your love (Charlotte Moore), reconnecting with your abusive mother and/or father (Beatrice Horseman & Butterscotch Horseman), trying to help someone achieve their dreams (Gina Cazador & Kelsey Jannings), naively following your own dreams (Todd Chavez), nothing will ever make you happy. Nothing will make you fully happy, because nothing is fully perfect. Substitute humans with some crazy wacky animals. Sprinkle a few unfunny jokes on top: the BoJack Horseman show.<br/><br/>Sadness is part of life. BoJack knows this, I know this, you know this. It's not news that everyone is sometimes sad and/or, even depressed. We, unfortunately, have so many examples of people "having it all", and yet, deciding that life is not worth living. The most depressing part about this show for me is how many people actually found this show "deep". Are people so empty that they need a pretentious show to tell them that life is not easy? Is this show a necessary evil? Or is it the symptom of a rotting society? I like to think people are better than this. I like to think that people can, and do, think for themselves. I like to think that for a show to be called "deep", it takes more than putting a horse mask on and saying "no one is 100% happy". Beyond the inside jokes and meta-humor best suited to the writers themselves than a mainstream audience (this is a Netflix series after all), this show reveals the nihilism that has grabbed hold of Hollywood and our vain, materialistic culture. What do you expect, when everything from promiscuity to profanity, from drug addiction to backstabbing, is now the norm?<br/><br/>The show tries to push some kind of moral struggle through the main character, who is toxic to his own relationships but tries to do good nonetheless. And yet, whatever accomplishments he makes in this struggle don't seem to matter much in the context of this mean and indifferent world that the writers have created for him to inhabit. <br/><br/>Forget about the strange phenomenon of humans coexisting with what are basically humans with animal heads. What kind of fictional animated world is this, where career women feel guilty for having natural human emotions, where friends threaten to kill each other (for laughs), and where rappers make music videos about how violence perpetrated against the defenseless unborn is "cool" and "hardcore"? Not to mention where characters often seem lost in nostalgia, as if to imply that the present world has turned into a hellhole of abandonment and despair. (It kind of has.) But if Bojack Horseman is trying to be as profound as so many critics say it is, why keep dwelling on the negatives of modern life instead of making an effort to show how things ought to be? Being realistic and "down to earth" only gets you so far unless you can build a constructive message from it, and Horseman's fatal flaw is its refusal to tackle real human problems seriously. It pretends to, but its quick diversion to flat gags and standard sitcom resolutions can only mean that it has no real answers for us. It's a sad sight, in all honesty. The biggest (and really only) appeal to the show is that it shows adult problems Bojack goes through. It's a character study, and it's a lot of social commentary and politics and a lot of drama and whatever, and that's fine and dandy. It might be a 9/10 show in that case... but as a 'comedy', the best jokes they have are usually uncreative, stupid, overdone, or just random things, like 2 kids in a trenchcoat pretending to be an adult... but they get into a relationship and it goes further than he expects. Unfortunately it sounds more funny on paper than it ends up being in the show, because they rely on the gag so much. There's some funny occasional quips sometimes, then I'm rolling my eyes when they end some deep, profound rambling monologue with "by the way, is it just me or do I sound really smart right now?" or something awful like that.<br/><br/>The humor is really lackluster and weak in the show, and most of the time it is just heavy drama and story. It's fine when you look at it JUST for that... but otherwise it's just a drag to get through if you don't care about it or aren't affected by any of it.<br/><br/>It really needed much better, memorable jokes. If you like straight drama and character development, it's a show for you. Maybe you could learn something from it if you wanna binge through it all if you really don't care about the comedy, but I could barely get past season 3. It really shouldn't be labeled as a comedy and more just a drama with some light comedic relief. It is a serie about yourself. Episode by episode. The animation, the dialogues, the characters are far be sugar drops. But this is the basic virtue of a serie defining, in profound-precise manner, the traits of contemporary world. It is a film about Hollywoo but, in the same measure, it is a good serie about the deep loneliness of us, far by excuses or surrogates. The result is not comfortable but it is so easy to understand than BJack is just yourself. To fully understand this TV series, you must have hit the bottom at least once in your life. At that moment everything will make sense. When I saw the first few episodes of Bojack Horseman I thought this is a shallow adult cartoon, a friend told me I should stick with it and bear through it so I did, when the show progressed I understood what he meant.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman has something that no TV series or I movie I have seen, no good ending it doesn't have the feeling of closure, because that's life you don't get happy endings good things and bad things come and go, you just experience it.<br/><br/>As a viewer I can finally enjoy a show that portrays a story I can actually relate to, I can feel the characters flaws, he tries to have a good life where he feels complete but he won't get it.<br/><br/>Thank you for creating such an amazing show Dark humor for sure. This is the best depiction of mental health I have ever seen on TV. I think it is funny that an adult cartoon with humans and animals people living together is the best portal of mental health on TV but it just is an I love it. I can not watch it too long because I sink into my feelings too much and get too depressed but it feels good to see This show is one of the best adult cartoons i've ever seen.
The characters have so many layers you can hate some of them in an episone and then, love 'em the next one.
I like how they treat continuity and how everything they do have consequences for the next chapters. Not only the best Netflix show ever made but also the best adult animated sitcom ever made. Bojack Horseman is a funny, heartbreaking and bitingly satirical show. Bojack Horseman is an adult cartoon that shows that you don't have to be crass and offensive to be considered mature. Bojack is mature for talking about heavy subjects such as depression, drug addiction and mental illnesses in a realistic and respectable manner and I applaud this show for that. Bojack Horseman is deep and I relate to the show so much. It changed my life! The last season is full of brilliant visual narration in its melancholic episodes like the one, unprecedented in the series, in which BoJack performs a monologue on his mother's wake or the scenes transitions that reminds us some of the best moments of the Satoshi Kon´s animation techniques (Millennium Actress, Paprika). The stories strengthen that contradictory feeling of wanting to be accepted and the fear of effectively be accepted that boycott over and over BoJack´s emotionality. THIS IS A REVIEW FOR SEASON 1 OF THE SHOW<br/><br/>First of all, the concept for this show is absolutely genius. For the most part of this season, everything is well-executed with entertaining story lines and characters, some humour every now and again, but also has its fair share of dark, emotional moments too which is exactly what I expected from this show.<br/><br/>The character of BoJack is possibly one of the best I have seen in any TV show, and everything about him is captured perfectly. Even though he frequently acts rather selfish and sometimes stubborn, you can really relate to his character and also he frequently expresses moments of regret which really do display his humanity and he isn't an idiot we're just automatically supposed to like, but we can also relate to him in a scary amount of ways. Will Arnett is also the perfect voice for him and he perfectly captures the darkness of the character, while also making BoJack someone you can feel sorry for.<br/><br/>The show's main side characters include Todd (the guy who sleeps on BoJack's couch), Princess Carolyn (BoJack's agent and former love interest), Mr Peanutbutter (BoJack's rival who has a huge heart but also has some other sides to him too) and Diane (BoJack's ghost writer for his new book and also Mr Peanutbutter's girlfriend). Each of these characters are given development and story arcs like BoJack himself has, and the first few episodes of the show dedicate some time to set up these characters. To begin with it did feel like they were slightly rushing with setting up these characters but over the course of the season they have continued to become more and more interesting. The character who stands out most to me is Mr Peanutbutter, who is a character who frequently appears happy and joyful but also has a few moments of darkness and to see the convincing switch between these two personas is a great achievement.<br/><br/>To begin with, the show takes its time at the start of the season to set up the characters and as I said earlier, there are a few episodes which are dedicated to setting up each singular character. However, the second half of the season begins to take the story into darker territory and became a gripping narrative after that point. This half of the season focused on BoJack's dark inner desires and also his past regrets which was executed fantastically. The episode that stood out to me the most was the 11th episode 'Downer Ending' which was not only a visual delight, it excellently portrayed the realm of BoJack's mind by showing his dark past and also how he wishes things could've turned out in his life which was truly heart-breaking to see. Episodes like these allow us to understand the dark character who BoJack can be at times and we can relate to him on a personal level.<br/><br/>Another thing I want to mention is how the show also pokes at ridiculous things about modern society too, the prime example episode being the 2nd episode 'BoJack Hates the Troops' in which BoJack states publicly how just because someone is a troop, it doesn't mean they're a hero unless they've actually done something to be a hero. The media then goes crazy after BoJack states that he hates some of the troops which is exactly how things play out in modern society, and it's not safe to have an opinion anymore. This second episode was the one that got me truly invested in the show so it has lots of significance to me.<br/><br/>Overall, BoJack Horseman Season 1 is a great start to an animated show, with a brilliant portrayal of its main character along with many great side-characters, as well as some very creatively-made and entertaining episodes. The season does get off with a slow and slightly confused start, but the second half of the season becomes very investing.<br/><br/>8/10 I started watching BoJack Horseman because I was bored to death by other Netflix shows, wanted to eat something and watch a light comedy while I was munching on some PBJ sandwiches. Boy, little did I know what I was getting into!<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman is the kind of show that promises light, dumb fun. That is, if you only watch the pilot. BoJack is an old guy, contemplating over life, kind of broken inside, has everything he needs and still isn't happy. I thought to myself: Funny, the guy's just like me (except I'm not old and of course, I'm not a millionaire). So I delved deeper. <br/><br/>The show starts off as your regular adult TV show and then boom kablazi, it kicks you in the crotch. BoJack is dealing with crippling depression, which starts to take its toll on his life more and more throughout the series, thus lending the show a darker tone. However, it never stops being funny. It just gets better and better. The jokes, the plot, the dialogue; everything. I hope it'll get at least another 2- 3 seasons that will live up to these ones! <br/><br/>Lots of folks mentioned the poor voice acting. I must tell you I don't know jack about voice acting, but I'd certainly notice if something was off. It's good and the voice actors fit their roles just fine. Don't get put off by some nit-picky snobs. Enjoy! This show is unlike any other show I have ever watched before. It asks some real questions through an unique character that I can personally relate to. It feels like this show itself has charm, it draws one in and makes you want to watch a whole season in one day. Although many of the characters are animals, it somehow makes it feel like it could be an non-fiction. This show is real, down to earth. As well as its serious tones, it has a humorous parallel. Corny jokes, hilarious situations and last but not least animal puns everywhere! Not to mention the witty names for many of the characters! Bojack Horseman is a very well written, unique show that really makes an experience. Watch Bojack Horseman. Just...watch it. So good. Not just really funny, but like, legitimately good. The first episode is a little clunky but trust me and stick with it. The writing gets SO good, the running gags are hilarious, there's tons of little hidden and easter egg jokes that make you literally-- and I actually mean literally and have the bruises to prove it--fall off your chair laughing when you catch them (hint: pay attention to anything written anywhere, and pause if you have to), great soundtrack, and just enough sincerity in just the right places. Like, every episode gets kind of serious at the end and ends up saying something shockingly profound or inspiring. Incredible cast and guest stars that can only be explained by some combination of celebrity friendships and Netflix's Scrooge McDuck-like piles of money.<br/><br/>Just watch it. And really pay attention. And thank me afterward. A message to potential viewers: Do NOT be turned off by the weak and derivative first few episodes-- this show hits its stride after finding a unique voice and turns into a real gem.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman nearly shoots its own foot off in the terrible pilot and uninspired first two or three episodes by emulating the worst qualities of Family Guy, etc. However, once all of the characters are introduced and the Season 1 story-arc gets rolling in earnest, BJH starts to surprise with better and better jokes, seriously poignant plot lines (one of my favorites is the episode where Princess Caroline turns 40), fun twists and turns, and by the end of the season, has transformed into a completely different and significantly better show than perhaps it has any right to be. I was honestly applauding upon the culmination of the Season 1 finale. It was actually heartfelt, funny, and rang true. What a remarkable comeback from a terrible start.<br/><br/>Hang in there past the first few episodes and don't throw in the towel. You'll be happy you stuck with it. This show is not for everyone. Now when you here that phrase you normally associate it with style or plot. Like 'oh this is a very slow burn, the average movie goer will get bored' or 'oh it's an action movie, cinema experts won't really like it' but that's not what I mean here. When I say this show is not for everyone, I mean as in some people will not be able to emotionally handle the the painful, powerful, and soul crushing themes. This show gets way heavier than you'd expect a show about talking animals in the city of Hollywoo to get. But I am being completely honest when I say that Bojack Horseman will leave you completely devastated. It dives head first into very traumatic and taboo subjects, like abuse, addiction, suicide, depression, anxiety, and among so many other things, sometimes just plain old death. And it will blur the lines so much between right and wrong, good and evil, so much, you'll be forced to revisit some clips in the show. It's a show that makes you think, and you'll need to rewatch many moments to really contemplate on what is happening. But I'm doing so, you will be rewatching gut wrenching moments of hurt and heartbreak. It doesn't matter that this show has some of the best comedy of the decade. That's not enough to keep you from drowning in tears. So no, this show is not for everyone. If you're like my mom, who didn't want to watch a dogs purpose because she thought it would be too sad, stay far away from Bojack Horseman. But if you can handle it, if you are capable of dealing with some of the most realistic depictions of the most terrifying parts of humanity, then watch this show. Bojack Horseman is a masterpiece, it has a slow start but if you can get through the first season, season 2 will pile drive you through the floor. Watch it. You won't regret it. What's not to like about The Horse from "Horsin' Around"? From its very humorous writing to its life lessons that make you really reflect days after watching, BoJack Horseman is a very unique masterpiece. As someone whose attention span is shorter than most I have never truly found a tv show that has gripped me. I find myself watching a few episodes and growing bored. But Bojack had me hooked from the first, until the last episode. It's truly funny, heartbreaking and challenging. It handles difficult topics with such incredible angles. The character development and relationships are realistic and raw. Bojack is an honest rare gem that I'm so glad to have spent my time watching. Never a dull moment. Couldn't recommend it enough! Please go watch it. This show has a slow start but let me tell you, it's something special. One of the strengths of this show is how it balances emotion with silly gags. It leads you down a path of "oh this show doesn't take itself all that seriously" and then hits you with powerful, sometimes challenging, moments. It's overflowing with character and is some of the best TV I've seen. It's not all perfect of course - some of the story lines are a little meh. But the heart of the show is 10 stars from me. I had heard about the show through numerous recommendations and constant praise so naturally I decided to check it out. And everything everyone else told me, did not prepare me for how good the show was. At the beginning, the characters are kind of pretty standard, which makes it a little slow but it is quick to pick up. What really amazes me is how the show manages to express that BoJack is a terrible person but never to the point of him being inhumanly evil. Related to that, despite every season showing BoJack cycling through his betterment and his eventual low point; each and every time you really feel like he's finally got it worked out and you want him to be happy but he winds up back at square one. Though he certainly does grow as a person, or horse rather. Better than you'd expect! It's really deep and profound Listen, this show is so good!! So deep and funny and beautiful!! I have never written a review anywhere on the internet. But after bingewatching this show i have to tell you i have not seen any show so layered, so developed and so hilarious at the same time that it makes you cry. I was left in awe for the few hours after i finished this about how this show was just something i started to get a few laughs and have fun at times but after a certain point i realized that its much much more. Thank god i witnessed this piece of art. Do you believe that some people are just too broken inside to put themselves on the right path? I do, or at least after I watched this show, I do. It's really not that surprising why Bojack acts the way he does, everything was written already and he had no say in it. His childhood was the corrupted seed and Sarah Lynn's death was the nail in the coffin. Every time he tries to make amends or start fresh, his shady past catches up with him faster than he can move forward, which tosses him back to rock bottom, and in that rock bottom he makes another mistake that adds to his previous series of his consecutive mistakes, which further fuels up his future screw-ups. Round and round it goes until one day he's really dead, and all he leaves is the wreck he made while he lived, that's his legacy. And the sadder thing is, soon the name Bojack and everything that associates with it would disappear in some dark corner of people's memory as if he never once lived. A lot of people would say blaming others for his own mistakes is irresponsible, but note this, nobody is an exception of being a product of the environment he or she was put in and raised in. I hate to say this, but we're less in control of ourselves than we'd expected or hoped, wherever there's a cause, there's a result. Undoubtedly Bojack's life is a tragedy, but the question of why it happened the way it did, is not that easy to answer. The truth is that I think this is one of the best series of all time, it has a good animation and it is very well written. By God, the free churro episode is one of the best written, or where he travels under the water to promote his movie, where there is no dialogue and the whole episode works thanks to the animation. But without a doubt the best episode of Bojack Horseman is the penultimate episode of the last season, when you see it you say "everything has to end here" but then you see the last episode that if it's good, it's sentimental but ... for how you see it series and they tell you how depressing his life is, how depressing his whole childhood was, the truth if you feel that the penultimate episode could be a better ending than the ending itself. This is the most real, down to earth, serious series I've ever watched. Didn't expect this at all when i first started watching Bojack. This might just be netflix's peek although it's wayyy under appreciated. Thank you Raphael for bringing this amazing journey to us, can't wait for what's next. Laughing and scolding, the screenwriter is too good to write. The combination of animal and human form is fun and fresh. The decadent daily life of the outdated stars after the soap opera of a lonely horse that was not loved as a child in adulthood, Hollywood and many celebrities lie down. Under the cloak of comedy is the satire of reality, high-level black, high-level sentimental, high-level comedy. After season 1 I thought it was okay but nothing particularly amazing.To be perfectly honest if my cousin hadn't told me how this show was the best representation of mental issues he'd ever seen, I wouldn't have pushed through.Well I ended up pushing through and i'm so glad I did. This show will truly make you reflect on your life and on life in general (without forcing some kind of message on you). It's so incredibly well done..It's smart, satirical, sad, hilarious and so very REAL. IMO the last season is up there with some of the best television ever created. Highly recommended. This must be my favorite animated show.<br/><br/>The writing is phenomenal, the depth of the characters that make them look human even though their animals is amazing and this show makes you feel a type of feeling that feels too real.<br/><br/>BoJacks decisions can sometimes be hard to watch and understand and sometimes they just feel human...<br/><br/>You can't really describe this show with words, you have to watch it by yourself to understand how great it's.<br/><br/>This show will definitely get a 10/10 I think I speak for all fans when i say it's been quite a ride.
In season 1 the show was still finding it's feet, and from then to season 6 the show had changed so much.
Watching this show I have been hit harder by some scenes then any other shows I have watched.
Bojack Horseman is an amazing representation of what life could to some extent be like for some celebrities in Holywood. I recommend the incredible journey that is the tale of Bojack Horseman. Crazy hijinx, gut wrenching twists, deep dives into the muck, and highwire "went there" comedy. He does his own stunts too. I've praised this show before, and it has always been worthy of praise, but as the final season comes to a close, I feel the need to praise it once more. Somehow, after 6 seasons, each season just gets better, and the final season is no exception. This show is as powerful and moving as it is hilarious and satirical. It's biting comedy just a veil over the deep existential well that is this show, a coverup of the sociological and philosophical impact of the shows commentary on the human condition. It perhaps doesn't offer all the answers, and will in fact tell you there are no easy answers, but it starts an important conversation about mental health and even the meaning of life, the purpose of life, in a healthy way that so many other shows have tried, and failed, to do. Watch this show. Its been years since i've seen the first season. i just finished season 5 and it felt like i've made an profitable investment of time. i cant really recall all that has happened, but as of now, i feel like it spoke about a lot of subject with an understanding, and an thought out tone.<br/><br/>8/10: after 5 seasons it felt like a great show I am firm in my belief that no other show will be able to do what Bojack did. This show starts off as some silly show about a horse making questionable choices and quickly turns into such a deep and emotional show about taking accountability and facing the real consequences of your own bad decisions in life. One of the best things to ever come from Netflix, BoJack Horseman is excellent. The characters feel extremely real. They are flawed, but learn and grow as the show progresses. More people need to watch this showz I actually started watching this show because i was bored after watching the first episode i wasn't sure whether it's any good or not but after a couple of episodes it got me interested.
This story revolves around people or in this show animals who suffers from depression due to the bad influence of parents and other loved once.It a story about people who refuse to growup and change their ways instead choose stick with the same destructive pattern over and over again no matter how much pain and suffering they bring to them selfs and their loved ones.
This show may seem ridiculous but its more ground to reality than most shows around today Bojack horseman is one of the best sows I have ever seen. Amazing storyline and definitely worth watching. From the outset the show may seem unappealing, Season One did not do the show any discernible favors by leaning too heavily on somewhat dated Hollywoo(d) based comedy, although dig deeper under the surface and you will find the most relevant and emotionally charged animated comedy on TV right now. <br/><br/>The show introduces us to Bojack, a struggling washed up actor who may still get roles, but nothing like his big hit Horsin' Around in the 90's. <br/><br/>Ultimately what this show is about, beyond everything else, is the pursuit of finding yourself, and finding a place in the world that seems to have left you behind and forgotten you, and I think we can all relate to parts of that, in life. OK so I admit it took me a while to discover this show and when I did it was sort of yeah what's all the fuss about? and then after a couple of more episodes it was where have you been all my life. Fantastic animated series an humanoid horse human lost in a sea of self pity and loathing. Will Arnett at is best ably supported by Aaron Paul and the rest. As a fan of previous works of Will Arnett and Aaron Paul, I was very curious to watch Bojack Horseman, which I thought was gonna be an interesting and funny experience, yet it wasn't that much. The jokes are not that funny, sure, it makes you giggle as it goes but you don't feel rewarded in the end. The animation is superb, I'll give them that. The plot is OK, a has been celebrity living his regretful life is solid, in my opinion. I was not disappointed, only unsurprised, I expected more from a Netflix show with such great actors voicing the characters. I give it a six for the brilliant actors in this show and for the great animation, not the jokes nor the plot. My impression of this show is pretty much the opposite of the critics; which is to say, it started off fun (quite excellent actually), then went downhill. And that's the key word: "fun" - which this show has lost.<br/><br/>This show simply takes itself a bit too seriously. I stopped watching this series at Season 5 ep 10; the main characters have reached a point where they're simply not likable anymore. The secondary characters - while likable, aren't interesting anymore. I have no idea what's in for Season 6, but I'm uninterested in finding out given the series' downward trajectory.<br/><br/>Unless you have a fetish for depression, there doesn't appear to be much to look forward to in future episodes of this show. I understand they write bojacks character to be unlikeable but they over do it ... bojack is so selfish and self centered to the point that he's so unlikeable it's painful to just watch .. I try to get thru an episode but I hate bojack so much .. they overdid it I think.. he literally has no redeeming qualities .. princess Caroline was the only character done right and maybe Todd but they went way overboard with bojack The series is too dark. It gets too existential after the pilot. I much prefer the first couple of episodes which were just about fun and comedy. The creators of this NetFlix original cartoon series turn Los Angeles into a giant version of the Mos Eisley spaceport from Star Wars Ep. IV, if it were drawn by children's author Richard Scarry on a bad day. <br/><br/>BoJack is a bipedal horse, and an actor, glorying in the trailing embers of 'Horsin' Around,' a long-ended 'Full House' sort of treacly family comedy.<br/><br/>His on-again, off-again love interest is a purple cat with a mouth like the alien in Alien. <br/><br/>Of course humans exist in his world also, alongside bipedal mosquitos, and talking penguins, and Bojack likes him some human girls, in the same way that Catherine the Great liked horses. <br/><br/>The initially absurd premise of the show, that anthropomorphized animals and regular homo sapiens walk around and clink glasses together, and that there's nothing odd about that, nothing at all, is not paired with any pay off or punchline that gets the audience to the other side of the chasm of annoyance the absurdity furrows. <br/><br/>The talented Will Arnett plays BoJack and good dialogue is written for him, but by the end of each episode whatever voice talents he can bring to bear are overwhelmed by the dim-to-gross animation of the animal characters and the inescapable heaviness the Dr. Moreau landscape the creators persist with. <br/><br/>Odd, yes, bizarre, for certain, but humorous? No, BoJack Horseman isn't very funny, or even mildly entertaining, at all. It's a cartoon series for adults that will make you chuckle, mainly in the first season, then takes a serious dark turn into the mind of a depressed horse. I guess I'll be one of the few reviewers not thrilled with this show. I was unsure after the pilot, but know you can't truly judge a show based on that. Well, made it almost to the end of season 2 after almost 2 months and my husband and I decided to quit. We just didn't care about the characters or what happens to them. Bojack has no redeeming qualities. He's a bad boyfriend, a bad friend, a bad employee, a bad client. Who cares if he's subsequently unhappy? I don't. I didn't find the show to be "deep", just heavy with a few clever "jokes" (more like social commentary, which yes, I did understand, but no, it wasn't enough to truly elevate the content) sprinkled in, but I don't think it's really funny enough to be considered a comedy, which is what we were looking for. Could only bare to watch a few episodes of this. Thought it was rubbish. Not funny, weird that the characters are a combo of human and animal (bit beastiality-esque). So many of the jokes are at the expense of the female characters. All characters are so stereotyped and boring. Just stupid all round really The first two episodes were laugh-out-loud worthy. It does take an interesting serious tone for a cartoon series with animal heads. Delves into depression and deals with some serious issues concerning relationships. I liked it, but I can see that this may not be everyone's cup of tea, as the humour element does drop off early. This show is life's itself.This show pushing me to thinking about life, peoples, mistakes, best animation i've ever seen. It's funny looking at a few of the negative reviews it's very easy to see that some people would rather watch "feel good," comedys about love and friendship and happy feelings with warm inviting families, but thats not the kind of show this is or ever set out to be. Some people obviously aren't very into dark/over the top humor and that's okay this isn't the show for you... That being said rating this show a 1 out of 10 is doing a real injustice to hard working talent on this show. It's really grinds my gears that some people won't even work past two episodes before jumping online to bash probably... No the realest show on Television right now! Sorry, just needed to rant a little about the bubbles some people choose to live in.<br/><br/>I don't want to really spoil anything, but do yourself a favor and get through the first season before voicing any criticism over this show. I had personally given up during the run of it's first season due to how unlikeable all of the characters were during the first episodes... But something happens towards the end of season one and you start to realize when watching, yeah... These characters represent some of your worst weaknesses as people and they are just human, even though they aren't. The whole humanoid animal hybrid thing will turn people off, but it works as a great device to structure of course some of shows famously creative punny/rhyme heavy humor and also it's very surreal dramatic moments.<br/><br/>Bojack horseman is very much like a great wine, it only has gotten better with age and shows no signs of growing stale. Well, it's all over written & everyone knows; Weak pilot and the first six episodes of the Season 01 are not that good either, it was ok but man oh man, after that it gradually becomes more and more darker. It provides So much of pop culture references (I barely have got any of them coz I only knew few of them), sarcastic jokes (which is really funny, a lot of them actually), drug abuse (which is pretty much dark), mental health issues (even way more darker), relationship with each other (it's really uncomfortable but it's the hardcore truth), self destructive behavior, racism, sexism, current political issues & show business, perfectly balanced with much accuracy.
I will adore this series forever & yeah, it is my favourite Animated series, Period. BoJack Horseman is has-been celebrity whose moment of fame has passed, but he's gotten the idea of maybe reviving his career or even his stalled life. This series is the crazed reflection of a lost soul, or maybe a city ("Hollywoo") of lost souls; can you relate to the concept? It's hilarious but it's also touching, and as messy as complicated as life itself. The first season intrigued me, and subsequent seasons have varied in quality. But the fifth season is something eerily reminiscent of genius. Best blend of philosophy & entertainment.
Recommended for people into existentialism, philosophy, thought provoking content and love to read the sub-text of the show. This show always surprises me. While I wouldn't call the artwork primo it's real enough that once my suspension of belief kicks in, I stop caring about that. I feel like each main character represents a different facet of a whole personality making each character both relatable and realistic. The voices were all perfectly cast and the plot is both drawing and seamless. The first time I watched it I didn't notice the change between the seasons. The intro sequence staying consistent with the show helps that out a lot. The show even gets pretty HBO, but despite knowing all that I already did the already raunchy show went over it's own top toward the end of season 2 and blew my mind. I loved this show. THIS IS A REVIEW OF SEASON 4 (MOSTLY) CONTAINS VERY MILD SPOILERS<br/><br/>Excellent series that I fell in love with. Insightful jokes, dark humour, superb tone and pacing.<br/><br/>It all ends with season 3 though.<br/><br/>Season 4 is almost completely devoid of any humour. It's full of unnecessary and uninteresting story arcs, and in most of the episodes Bojack is basically a background character.<br/><br/>The premise of this season takes a bit to establish, and while the premise itself is fine and could be eventually interesting, it takes too long and is not utilized in any way. Only way it IS utilized is the end its consecutive story arcs.<br/><br/>Bojack-centered story arc is short and relatively minor compared to the screen-time given to other characters personal dramas. It feels like a show in Bojack Horseman universe, and not a show about its main character.<br/><br/>It wouldn't even be so bad, if not for completely botched ratio of depressive / funny content. The best part of this show was exactly that - when the writers wanted to 'go deep' with Bojack story, they masterfully connected jokes and drama, so after watching an episode, a viewer was left with this 'tears of sadness mixed with laughter' bittersweet kind of emotion. It made the show unique, and true. Not every episode was like that, but the depressing/existential ones usually were.<br/><br/>When the first seasons made me feel bad, it was for a reason, or at least it felt that way. Bojack, apart from being self-centered arrogant asshole on daily basis, usually TRIED to do the right thing when it came to deeper moral problems. Obviously he usually failed miserably along the way. It made the character easy to empathize with, and made him feel realistic in his eternal dilemma - do the right thing, or succumb to egotistical self-centered thoughts. A rather universal human predicament.<br/><br/>Sure, Bojack struggled and complained a lot in previous seasons, but now? Now there's NO struggle, No dilemma, there's ONLY complaining (and not the comical one). Bojack was always an asshole, but his dilemmas were understandable - at least when they weren't entirely comical or sociopathic. Now, in place of real and universal human (horse?) emotions, we get toxicity and depression. And almost nothing else. Sure, toxicity and depression are common too, but they are certainly less comical than being pathologically self-centered.<br/><br/>Bad analogy: You could say that before, it seemed that Bojack needed some serious therapy with a psychologist (like we all do to different degrees, right?) and there was still some space for humour. Now, it looks like he needs hospitalization, psychiatrist, and lifelong drug therapy. It's not funny at all, it's just sad.<br/><br/>Watching 'current' Bojack just makes me feel lousy. Awful things are happening to characters for Non-Bojack related reasons (or for no reason at all), and it's a weak thing to do, narratively speaking. Really weak and lazy writing, sorry to say it. Weak, when compared to the quality of previous seasons. Feels like a first draft of a script, and whoever wrote it mistook cheap drama for depth. <br/><br/>'Bojack Horseman' seems like The Simpsons story all over again. After a great beginning with several excellent seasons, the show falls into mediocrity, with each new episode being a weak imitation of what made the show great in the first place. Did the original writing team walk off the show? It certainly feels like that.<br/><br/>Sorry for my rant, but i used to LOVE this show up until now. A real pity. I'm so sick of hearing people praise this show so much for doing basically nothing. The characters get themselves into dumb scenarios that 90% of the time, they're 100% at fault for. The entire show is characters whining about exaggerated problems over and over, and that's the entire show. If you want comedy? The best you're gonna get is a stupid animal pun or some character acting like an idiot, or the same tired gag over and over, like a kid wearing a trenchcoat.<br/><br/>This is the most love it or hate it show I've ever seen on television. Most people I talk to offline just straight up get bored or fall asleep by the first episode, and who can blame them? It's always the same crap. It's just whining and talking and whining and talking and there's NEVER any real action or anything to keep your attention. The ONLY way the show works is if you are immediately invested in these characters and every single little minute problem and detail they have in their lives. If you don't care about the characters, the show is a waste of time. Because that's all it is. Character "development" (aka them just bickering with eachother) and them whining about their problems that usually mean nothing, because the entire time it just feels like a bunch of writers throwing characters into stupid convoluted situations and making crap up as they go along, moreso than an actual story being progressed, or anything being told at all. It's like sad family guy with animal characters.<br/><br/>I can think of many, many better shows that are much more worth your time. Breaking Bad is actually well written. It might not be a super accurate depiction of mental illness like this show apparently is, but at least you can watch the episodes without wanting to gut yourself by the end of it, and at least the entire HOOK of the show isn't literally only just "this person is very sad and whines about his life problems". I mean you get a lot more emotions in general out of any other show. A show is supposed to be an emotional rollercoaster. Bojack Horseman is just a straight constant stream of FEEL SAD NOW OK!! for practically every single minute of every single episode. It's a miserable DRAG to watch, god forbid if you bingewatch it.<br/><br/>It's a shallow, boring overrated show. It fails to be entertaining as a show, and it fails at being a realistic, accurate show. It builds up to plots that always fall flat or get solved by some stupid deus ex nonsense. I will never believe a show can be called realistic if a failing actor can just ditch an entire movie and then they just say "haha its fine we just CGIed you in, no lawsuits" and everything is fine and dandy, but once Bojack gets rejected by a married girl or something stupid and small, oh man it's the end of the world!!<br/><br/>Just watch a more entertaining show. It's not comedy, it's not even really a TV show, it's just depression . Not even good depression , either, it's just stupid, forced eye-rolling drama. After just watching the fifth season for the second time in preparation for the first part finale of the final season, I'm now completely confident in calling BoJack Horseman my favourite show of all time. I'm in awe at how good the show is. It always takes me until the intro for the second episode of a season to remember why I love this show more than any other. I get goosebumps in anticipation for the brilliant episode and season that lies ahead, then I simply say to myself "God damn you are brilliant".<br/><br/>The writing is incredibly tight, the characters are more real than perhaps any characters I've ever seen despite having a premise that sounds ridiculous and one you wouldn't take seriously upon hearing about it. The animation is very expressive but the attention to detail is perhaps the most I've seen in a show. Honestly the amount of sight gags and references that fill the show deserve a repeat viewing of each episode on their own. The music fits incredibly well and I've found some songs that I absolutely love and play very often from the song. The voice work is stellar to say the least, it is so good you don't really ever stop to even notice that the voice actors and actresses are doing a fantastic job. I have grown with the show and it has helped change the type of media I consume and how I analyze them. It has made me laugh countless of times but it has also continuously broken my heart and left me gut punched.<br/><br/>It is hard to fathom how the creators and writers have managed to consistently deliver what is among, if not the best, season and episodes of television for the past 6 years or so. Every year we have two or three episodes from the show that completely blow you away. The show has produced what should be among the greatest episodes of television ever produced, and it somehow does this every season!<br/><br/>Honestly once this show ends, which is fast approaching, it will be one of the most bittersweet moments I will have experienced. I would never want the show to go on longer than it should but to say I will miss my favourite show dearly is an understatement, is an understatement in and of itself. There will be nothing to replace it and I'm not sure I want to try and find one. I will keep watching great shows but this is still the only show I make an active effort to watch every season twice and will definitely watch the entire show again once it finishes. It was a classic in the making after the later part of season one, but right from the moment that second season dropped, the show all but secured its legendary status. Thank you for the top notch TV quality and entertainment, you will be missed. I've never seen any series that has better ending than this. 11/10 for the ending, 7/10 for season 1. My final score will be 9 Starting with a 'must watch' wouldn't be enough for this show. It's an experience, the experience of becoming part of this wonderful, funny, colorful world filled with interesting, reletable characters. Growing affection with them, become happy when they are, or cry when they do. Listen to their music on the bus and wondering, why one character did this or that and wainting for the next part.
Yes. It really is a whole experience. I first watched this show because i wanted to laugh and I thought this is the show needed. But it wanst. There is some scenes that will make you laugh but in general this show is so deep and is makes me sad.
Please if you are a suicidal person dont watch this show. This year "Joker" made a very detailed and sensitive comment on mental health and people who are suffering from it, but also recently i came across a very very brilliant show "BoJack Horseman" its a web series on Netflix. In India i can say this series is very much underrated, This show talks about a horse, Yess a horse with a human voice and emotions who is suffering from some serious mental issues. Everyone tries to love him but he always destroys that feeling by doing something inappropriate not deliberately but its like this has become his attitude towards life. Why he is like this the shows talks about that part as the series goes ahead.
Many times you feel bad, angry,happy for BoJack you compactly get hooked to that horse who is just horsing around.
All the other characters are mostly some animals like cat, dog or penguin but they have human emotions and this make the show more awesome!!!
So I would defiantly recommend to watch this show because the way they have successfully achieved to show the real emotions there is no comparison to it!! Weird, funny, dry, sarcastic - everything you could want in an animated show. BoJack, along with the other characters are extremely humanized and the series itself has a depth had not been anticipated. A lackluster beginning made me fear the worst when I began to watch this show once the first season dropped. Fortunately it picked up pace halfway through the season and turned into a seriously relatable, depressing, yet entertaining experience. Some brilliant running jokes, one liners, and characters bring comedic value throughout, but it is peppered with some situations that I'd never expect from a cartoon, even after the trend of adult animation. Bojack horseman, for me personally, is one of the most emotionally relatable characters in television, just from the way they depict his reactions. You feel like you're in the head of this egotistical, depressed, shot out horse. Certain episodes in particular such as 'time's arrow' and 'the old sugarman place' delve even deeper, taking on common situations that plagued past generations relating to immoral values, pridefullness, and ego in a slightly satirical way that exaggerates the horrors of what you're watching, while making them easy to appreciate. First of all Bojack is one of my favourite shows in Netflix. Loved the balance between drama and comedy. Its comedy is fancy and similar to south park like its social commentary. I also enjoy character moments and almost everything Todd says. Its drama and character arcd have been quite satisfying for many characters like princess carolyn, mr peanutbutter and even todd had some. I know Bojack is the lead and most of the series has been about him and his relationships. I beleive his arcs' repetition started to wear out. I mean every penultimate episode we continue to see bojack's lowest and it doesn't still get better. Is it the direction we were being directed? Are we watching Bojack's demise in a sugarcoated way? These are the questions i have been asking since i finished watching season 5. This is not a very serious criticism and i will not stop watching but since the beginning we witnessed the lives of actors and their sidekicks in a glamorous yet cruel background. We also see similar stories in entertainment news etc. And i beleive we have been quite fed up to stories of actors or actressed failed to keep it together. This show gave me the impression that they will explore rhis situation and maybe find a way to turn around this pessimistic, downward way. But now, i am not sure this is the thing they want to tell or maybe the impact of many dramatic moments in the show were more satisfying to the viewers but i think doing this over and over again will be just exploitation and wear out the impact on the viewer. In it's fifth season BoJack Horseman remains one of the best shows on TV, and arguably Netflix best show. It arguably doesn't quite hit the highest heights of season four but the "show about a talking horse" yet again delivers real drama and character development amongst all the jokes If you haven't watched this show, put down every other one and get to it. This self depricationg self aware comedy, drama satire is so chockful of funny moments, it never get old. Probably the best cartoon i've watched.
pretty raw, funny and very nice cast. Although the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, the season is both dark, and funny as any to date. There is poignancy in the fact that bad things don't get reported because they might make things even worse for the accuser. It is a great show with lessons and it shows that not all rich people are happy This is a show for adults, and a great show for adults at that. <br/><br/>BoJack is an anthropomorphic horse who, in summary, hates himself and takes it out on everyone around him. He was once a successful actor who achieved great fame and fortune after starring in a cheesy but successful 90s sitcom. Since that show's end, he's resorted to stagnating in his LA mansion, living off his seemingly bottomless riches and distracting/comforting himself from all his issues (loneliness, emptiness, mundanity, etc) with booze, philandering, indulgent nostalgia from the good ol' sitcom days, and basically cursing the world in as many ways as possible.<br/><br/>Despite BoJack's cynical persona, over time he proves himself to be a thoughtful and incisive person intolerant of BS yet also someone who wants to care but is terrified to. He ends up being a character we're all familiar with: a hurt softy taking refuge from himself and society in the protected darkness of a hard shell.<br/><br/>The story progresses in a number of ways, but is primarily hinged on the exploration of BoJack's psyche, which is incrementally revealed through his interactions with the many (fun) characters in the show, particularly with Diane Nguyen, a ghost-writer tasked with writing a tell-all autobiography of BoJack's life.<br/><br/>The writing is great; it's clever, hilariously parodies TV and societal tropes, and it's unpredictable. The voice acting is spot-on for the characters. And although the animation is somewhat crude, it depicts the vibe of the show well. In all, I highly recommend this show. It's a trip. What can I say about Bojack Horseman? It's such an interesting way of Netflix to define what adult animation can really do, and have such a lasting appeal to its adult audiences. I love just about everything about how a former washed-up actor can deliver such raunchy adult humor, and surprisingly, the jokes throughout the series does such an amazing job, you'll totally get the jokes and have a joy with the show's way of amusing you. Also, love how the cast has human and animals throughout, which kinda makes the show all the more reason to laugh and smile at how much fun the writers have and get away with a lot of things you can accomplish in an adult-oriented animated series, more so than live-action. Overall, Bojack Horseman is an interesting series to get into animation and have loads of fun-fueled entertainment that will surely be watchable again and again. 'Bojack Horseman' is a unique TV show. I haven't seen anything like it. It's a dark comedy that goes really dark, plumbs the depths of human misery, but still remains a comedy, and that subject matter is very incongruous with the visual style: it's a colorful cartoon and the protagonist has a horse's head. This really striking combination makes an intriguing watch.<br/><br/>The story follows Bojack Horseman, a washed-up actor who is still wealthy and connected but much past his peak popularity. He is surrounded by ex-girlfriend/agent Princess Carolyn (a cat), a friend/rival Mr. Peanutbutter (a dog), a social media expert doing a book on him, Diane (a human), and Todd, a freeloader who has no business living with a celebrity. The show chronicles Bojack's ups and downs, but mostly downs. The opening credits show him drunk at a Hollywood house party, overcome by an anxiety attack and almost drowning in a pool.<br/><br/>Both the opening and ending credits songs are really great, too. I actually hated the ending credits song at first, but after a few episodes I started to get used to it, and a little later I realized its brilliance. I've been watching from the very first episode and loved the first couple of seasons - even though there is a dark thread. My issue is that since then it started to focus more and more on dark themes. Not humor. First 2 seasons 9/10 after that 5/10. I hope they regroup and look for fun and entertaining instead of sad and depressing soul searching content. This show glorifies abortion like it's a "brave" thing to do. I get it, Netflix is leftist media but they at least should've been mindful of the fact that people do in fact (unintentionally) get influenced by the show. Moreover, the show depicts US history in such a way that it virtually misleads audiences into believing that US history has a patriarchal base and women were virtually not even considered people. It goes to the extent that one of the more "wise" characters trashes the Second Amendment and promotes prohibition of possession of guns. Overall, character development and storyline are smooth sailing but gradual indoctrination of leftwing belief in the minds of the audiences made this show off-putting. Bojack Horseman is quite funny, absorbing and deep. It's major downfall is it's sometimes mundane obsession with celebrity culture that is blanketed by the fact that every character is a different animal in a human language world. The celebrity appearances feel overused at times as well. Nevertheless, there is quite intelligent subject matter and the storyline related to Bojack's childhood and subsequent personality defects are particularly engrossing. Oh boy. Yet another depressing, obnoxious show that contains drugs, alcohol, sex, stupidity, politics and did I forget to say more stupidity? It has BS that 98% of people in North America have to deal with because they are well...Dumb. They will continue to watch crap shows because their reality is not good at all.<br/><br/>This show is no different from all the other adult filth shows. The characters are characters we've seen before and the plot is about plots that we have seen before about depressing non-sense.<br/><br/>BoJack is just another depressing show like I already said. Its nothing that I've never seen before. If anything these new modern day adult cartoons are all bad. It's another emotionally brutal season for Netflix's animated sitcom about the perils and pressures of Hollywood. The show has been extraordinarily layered in its exploration of the pressures of the entertainment industry and has managed to balance dark material thanks to a litany of genuinely hilarious jokes and interesting subplots, but here the cracks starting to show. The supporting characters have stagnated and the show's structure is becoming predictable and repetitive in its apparent effort to never let any positivity or hope come through, and it's starting to be punishing and tiresome. On the plus side, the voice work is just as strong as ever before, in particular Will Arnett in the titular role, who continues to imbue the character with equal parts tragedy and buffoonery, and series newcomer Stephanie Beatriz, who acclimatizes herself very well. A change in the show's emotional DNA may be necessary if Bojack's story will continue for more seasons, and while it may be the weakest season so far, it's still pretty good. I shouldn't be giving this a positive rating, but the pros have so much potential that I'd be kicking myself if I didn't.<br/><br/>When the writers of this show try to establish Bojack as a dramatic setup, it usually works. However, since this is a comedy-drama, comedy being the priority, it fails quite often. The jokes just aren't funny. They do not take advantage of the surreal world effectively that could have made way for more odd humour, nor have the darkness of shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, in the end, barely outclassing Family Guy in terms of pop culture-based humour. <br/><br/>I suspect if there were more examples of adult animated dramas, this show would comfortably write an interesting character study of a terrible person, along the lines of Moral Orel Season 3. However, as it stands, I don't believe it will.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping that Season 3 was better than abysmal Season 2. I Would like to start by saying that from seeing commercials for this show It looked to be entertaining. I've always been a fan of Similar shows such as Rick and Morty, Squillbillies, Aqua Team, Futuram and South Park. But this is just down right awful.<br/><br/>The characters voices are more annoying than what I've ever heard on any other animated comedy. This pathetic show tries to take a stab at classic tv shows of the 90's. All of the charectors are just lame alcoholics with nothing interesting going on or anything funny to say. It wasn't that interesting to me. Horrible to watch how doting it is. Its Really good I like it a lot you should watch it This is probably the most creatively hilarious comedy/drama being made right now, and it's animated, so you really have no reason not to watch it. Unless you hate puns. This show is built on puns.<br/><br/>Layers of surprising character development support a goofy and unique comic style. This style is typified by exercises in wordplay so complex that they provoke respectful applause rather than laughter, animal puns baked into everything from the dialogue to the set design, and smart satire built into the fictional world. Some of my favorite examples of this humor are the subtle puns that they never actually use, but merely pepper the scene with for the audience to find on their own-a painting in the style of Van Gogh's famous self portrait, but he's been replaced with a goat; an anthropomorphic statue of the Punisher as a rabbit. I'd list more, but I haven't found many of them.
The drama is thought provoking and blended well with the comedy, although this often means that one brings the other to a grinding halt. My favorite parts of this show, especially in the most recent seasons, are the impressively apt and insightful depictions of mental disorder, stress, and addiction. Watch out for S4E6 and S6E2, they floored me.<br/><br/>The show has exceeded my expectations from day one and only gets better with each additional season. I can't wait to see the path of this truly impressive animated series. Bojack Horseman is unique. On one end it's an adult animated comedy. On the other, the creators have a few things to say and they aren't afraid to use the series to that end.<br/><br/>While it starts off like a typical comedy, the main character Bojack, is remarkably unlikeable. This may hinder most viewers because it's not only until the later episodes, the darker themes start to take form. And through them, you see the antihero, Bojack and understand why he behaves the way he does. While the humour may not be to your taste, with absurd scenarios and random quips, the story behind each character is developed quite well. Through the characters, Bojack Horseman excels in storytelling and character analysis.<br/><br/>Moreover, I enjoy the non-episodic nature of Bojack Horseman as I find most formulaic shows become dull gradually. The showrunners aren't afraid to experiment with episodes having different spins and perspectives, making certain episodes notable in the entire series. So that it feels novel and fresh. Making it stand apart from other series of it's kind.<br/><br/>Another trait of this series is the subversion of plot tropes. It's aim of realism, allows the series to disallow a happy ending, and not give closure. This causes the series to feel melancholic and disturbing at times, but it's what makes the series the more impactful. It's difficult episodes honestly spurred some reflection and I found them incredibly memorable for a twenty-minute episode. More realistic perhaps, but definitely not something other series have continuously tried.<br/><br/>Bojack Horseman may at times feel clumsy, but it's due to the difficult nature of intertwining the comedic and cheerless moments in the series. I was engaged throughout and I'm looking forward to seeing, how else they are going to redefine the comedy series. This show is amazing, bingeworthy, and relatable even when you have absolutely nothing in common with Bojack. Not many people can relate to his actual life story, but this cynical show will have you feeling his emotions throughout. Not a family show. certain episodes really messed me up so make sure you are some what emotionally stable. actually watch it either way. godspeed IMO the second episode of season 5 the old sugarman place was my favourite episode of all time. an episode that combined the ghosts of the past with the current time and explained much as to why bojack's mum was the way she was. whilst i enjoyed season 5 it lacked something present in the previous seasons. Delivers some great humor and amazing emotional depth and character development that will make you invested in every single character. In it's fifth season BoJack Horseman remains one of the best shows on TV, and arguably Netflix best show. It arguably doesn't quite hit the highest heights of season four but the "show about a talking horse" yet again delivers real drama and character development amongst all the jokes. But it's not far off it, well written the hate able characters are very likeable for the hate factor. It's engaging, entertaining, funny, but again, just missing a lite of the top The comedy in this show is bult almost primarily on sarcasm derived from the endless struggle for Happiness. This is a show about a Has-been Actor that struggles to find a place he belongs, if you think youd enjoy an animated show that can take you on an emotional rollercoaster and also makes you think deeply about your own life then i highly recommend it! I found this show one day while searching through Netflix. It's one of my favorite shows that I have watched since Family Guy!<br/><br/>This show in its entirety is great to watch! Each episode is Humorous, dramatic, and you will always get hooked into the next episode.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this show is it aims at Celebrities and current politics. More of a less, this is mock off South Park and this show is awesome to watch!!!!<br/><br/>I love all the characters and how they live together. It really makes me want to watch seasons 1-5 all over again!!!! Can't wait for season 6 if they do one..... Bojack is one of those strange animation series that not everyone get. I can not watch this with my girlfriend because she feels "uncomfortable" with the animals/human crossover world. However i believe that if i can get her to see two episode it will end.<br/><br/>Okay, over to the review for this season, and i must say this is a show that really grows on me. The twelve episodes went by really fast, and the one with the aquatic world was great in all its dark conclusion. However nothing will prepare you for the downhill the last three episodes takes you on. Without spoiling it gives us a great voice-performance from the actors that really shows us the dark and human sides of the different cast, until it all again goes into a crazy frenzy, totally deluded from real life. <br/><br/>Behind all the madness and the surreal situation there is a pure human drama about an man, on the wrong side of the lifespan, forced to confront his accomplishments. While Bojack is riding high with his performance in a Oscar-worthy blockbuster drama, he is mentally still in the stage where we left him last season. Alone with serious mental issues. We now follow him in both present and in 2007 around the time of his "bojack horseman show" and we see more of the background to why he became who he are. <br/><br/>In some aspects the episodes focus on other characters also, but the main character is of course Bojack and in the climax of the last three episode we see the final breaking of him and the season ends on a semi-cliffhanger. For me Bojack represents the potential of good histories told on binge-watching. I can not recommend this enough. It's an ok series.. watchable.. but not good as th reviewers say It's just OK...literally just okay. Maybe not my cup of tea Bojack Horseman is an complex and interesting cartoon. It stars the Protagonist with his self- destructive behavior and his history with booze and drugs. He always pushes it too far in some episodes. This show is certainly one that will not be forgotten soon.<br/><br/>It is let down by its subpar first season but then becomes more exciting and tense. The show easily lets you know that Bojack is a bad person..<br/><br/>It has really bad comedy all throughout the show, with 'Todd' providing the childish and low effort jokes all throughout the series. He makes the show less realistic and worsens the quality.<br/><br/>I do not think that this show is depressing or sad as it makes the more serious moments more silly, and they are many, many more depressing shows.<br/><br/>Rating = 7 out of 10 I'll admit the start of this show is a bit wonky but the more you watch it the better it gets and by season 3 it turns into something special. Best and better
Totally recommend guys
I hope u like it Give it a shot and you wouldn't regret a bit of it Never gets boring! Dark comedy which leaves you thinking about so many things. This is a Netflix original staring Will Arnett,Alison Brie and Aaron Paul. It's a alright animated series with it's good parts and slow parts. It does have a nice change of pace from most TV shows on Netflix. The humour isn't for everyone but it has some points where it really works and it pays off. Seeing all the different celebrity cameos they have in the show is a nice touch to. This show did have some points where I broke down in laughter and loved it. But at the same time I felt like I sitting through mediocre filler.Overall it's a decent 12 Episode show and worth watching if you are a fan of the voice actors and off beat humour. Aint funny extremely boring,ridiculously made cartoon i would say A drinking talking horse, worst show I've ever seen... and people call wrestling fake! Also Paul Adam Lynch needs to stop whacking off to cartoons in his mum's attic Started off brilliantly, gradually began to believe more and more of its own hype, and finally collapsed in a load of existential drivel.<br/><br/>The 'dark' plot lines would have been fine - if they had stayed *lines* and not become the entire series.<br/><br/>It gradually got less and less funny, and so became boring. When it was a black comedy it was good. Because it was a black comedy. Not just bleak, dark, tedious and repetitive. Oh so repetitive. Oh how it repeated itself, repeatedly, repetitively and - I repeat - with repetition.<br/><br/>All the beauty had gone from it.<br/><br/>So disappointed.<br/><br/>Netflix writers kill yet another good idea, and I think Netflix itself for once did the right thing. Take it out and shoot it. The animation and overall quality of the drawings are terrible and ugly the story is a ripoff nicolas cage's character from leaving las vegas James Mason in a Star Is Born Even Starling Archer from Archer the only difference is he's a grotesque horse head with a humanoid body. Usually something like that would be hunted down with pitchforks and torches not a failed te. evision actor. He is unrelatable and uninteresting when his mother died I couldn't believe some people thought that was a sad moment. This show cannot get me to sympathize with these poorly drawn poorly written characters like most "animated adult comedies" it is ironically childish and uncomedic from everything that seth macfarlane has made to the terrible american animated comedies on the ironically named comedy central tbs and on netflix. Most animated adult comedies are poor simpsons imitations with poor animation quality that are made for the lowest common denominator Bojack Horseman is no exception. This show is so shallow. Every character in this show is stupid and inconsiderate. Bojack is an who never does anything productive in any episode. His agent is another one and dont know what she sees in him.
The amount people relating to this show shows the problem of this society. The kids, without even starting their lives, feel like they are 50 year old Bojack Horseman.
The show doesnt have any deep philosophy or something. This show is for people who think they have deeper philosophy than anyother life in this planet. TV surrounding media having a predilection for whatever can be seen as deep or meaningful is nothing new. Their lack of knowledge of how that is a category that can't be imposed into anybody, due to the intrinsic subjectivity it's nothing new. This show, however, can wrongly be conceived as new.<br/><br/>When so many shows run away from the modern world social scenario, mainly the most-watched and "mediatic" ones, eluding a world that is characterized by an excessively interesting and at times complex script, it creates a particular situation. That when a show tackles it they automatically praise it if not for anything, for its braveness and that's honestly not a bad thing. The flaw is having the prejudice of believing that the fact of doing so in any manner makes such series good or even great merely because they did not fail miserably. When they do not fantasies and portray, with dreamlike happy shades of colors tainted over a cruel and downright nasty environment such as those present in problematic worlds like prostitution or the enticing nature of everything that surrounds drugs, they will automatically be above a seven in a one to ten scales like this one.<br/><br/>Funny enough, that what makes this show must, rather than might or ought to watch, television, because it does somewhat, not truthfully nor completely tackle feminism in our present, in mass media, androcentrism, sexual identity, structural deficiencies of society... With bluntness, straightforwardness and at times preciseness. This is a show you ought to watch for yourself because the reaction will vary widely. You will either watch it and force yourself through it or you will make the wise decision of not continue watching it beyond the third season, maybe even the forth.<br/><br/>It is not enticing, not because "it represents life itself", but because it doesn't show much progression and it does get old pretty quickly. There won't be a time where you are happy and contempt with every character's place in the show (that being the point and that being life), they will vary very little and so will the simplistic roles and feelings you have for any of them, for you won't develop much attachment. Barely at times do characters show true complexity outside their simplistic attributions. The good, the bad, the evil, the innocent, the gullible, each of their addictions. All those qualities and more will for a time be stripped away from the character which you do attribute it to and deposited in one that you will not believe its set upon, making it at least not completely homogeneous from a narrative standpoint for an episode worth of time in a twelve episodes per season format.<br/><br/>It quickly becomes evident that Will Arnett's performance it's more entertaining and worth of continued watching than a single joke wrote in these whole series. Fun it's not what it strives for and it should be proud that it does not achieve it at any time. Subverting expectations does get frustrating when it becomes the manly and overbearing staple of your show. It's not agonizing, rarely if ever socially claustrophobic.<br/><br/>It does touch rather nihilistic self-appointed and self-interested views, the principle of agency in one's action and responsibility as a concept, whenever the character eludes it or face it (check Wisecracks take on the show). It does touch the staple of family and how in some cases rather than live with our family we have to survive them. If that is something we ought to do, if we have the capacity of leave them behind. This shows tackles how there aren't absolutistic principles in which we may live our lives, be it in love, hate or friendship. Be it in how do each of them gives us grief or the keys for temporary, never ever lasting, happiness. It does tackle how people embrace toxicity, although in a highly ridiculous manner, showcasing cases in which there's no moral quandary and judging becomes rather easy, where the good and bad decisions according to social construct generally are obvious to the eye.<br/><br/>It's A tale of how complex humans are and the hardship of life itself. More applicated to Hollywood (where ego's reach inconceivable, self proclaiming deity levels). A tale of addiction to sorrow and pain. Of love deprivation in the early stages of Bojack's life. Of mental illness. It's a pompous and pretentious show that could be narrated through the unquantifiable quotes of Oscar Wilde that roam the internet. Bojack Horseman is fantastic at what it does. Ans that is telling stories about characters that are so relatable. And the idea that a lot of them are animals is exactly the right thing that opens it up for a lot of comedy. It makes the tragedy more bearable. But the series sometimes gets a little to quirky or does too much plot in a small amount if time, just to make the next episode a filler again. I am long over anthropomorphised animal people and watching their lives on candid camera.<br/><br/>The situations and premise just seem rehashed from numerous older shows, and the shows pacing just seems forced to either make people deal with something they didnt need to in an unamusing way, or just waste time with blow hard tactics aimed at making people feel empathy with the characters. BUT IT DOESNT WORK!
I just felt nothing withthe show, and after watching episodes 1-5 with some friends baout 4 years ago, I never went back. At least the shows finally over, so that something good might fill the airways ( fat chance, entertainment in most forms has been dead for years lol) . Oh well. 5/10 show at best. If you decide to watch "BoJack Horseman", just be sure NOT to watch it along with your kids. That's because unlike most cartoons, it's a rather adult one at times and is not intended for younger audiences.<br/><br/>The story is about a loser ex-TV star, BoJack Horseman. Like many characters in this cartoon, the is an anthropomorphic animal--in this case a horse with a human body and voice. Most of the schtick is about how terrible BoJack is as a person(?) and how although he might appear to be growing in awareness and personality, he's still essentially a big, rich jerk.<br/><br/>The show's biggest strength is that the plots are all very unusual and very easy to like. It's also rather clever and worth seeing...providing you don't mind the crude references as well as a leading character you really CAN'T like. Ok, so apparently I'm the only person in the world whose not crazy off his rocker bonkers about this show, and I think a disgruntled mob with pitchforks might assemble on my front lawn to skewer me for saying so... but heres my take....First the pros: It has decent writing, and occasional* (emphasis on occasional) funny and insightful social and cultural bits of satire /commentary and top notch voice acting particularly from Will Arnett and Aaron Paul and it does have one of the best intros sequences I think of any animated show but ... The cons: it's still just essentially a half decent yet self indulgent empty depressive sitcom about a washed up entitled kind of dumb egocentric but self aware sitcom Actor and his struggle between validating a legacy and using it to compensate for his self doubt stemming from a broken childhood and filling the voids inbetween with more voids and everybody thinks it's so novel because it's pointlessly packaged as a cartoon, barely using the medium of animation to be visually creative other than pointlessly making random characters animals as generic one note personality jokes or puns that get boring after 2 minutes, they pidgeonhole (no pun intended) themselves into this then beat it to death for the rest of the show...there's an episode with a chicken where they pull literally every chicken pun possible out until by the end I felt like someone vindictively shoved a rubber chicken down my throat.....and I was coughing up feathers....and why the heck is bojack horseman a HORSE!!!! and they really blew an opportunity to create a clever buddy dynamic between Todd and Bojack, and they flirted with this idea in the beginning of the show but instead they turned Todd into a pointless dimwitted borderline mentally handicapped jester in a series of loosely related incoherent idiotic b story misadventures, hes totally undeveloped as a character, just a 2 dimensional cardboard cutout of a character with no depth or motivations explored, compared to Bojack, a fairly well fleshed out character...its a blown opportunity.....strip away the animation and it's just a inconsistent average hollywood sitcom spoof about behind the scenes hollywood and the fallout of a once iconic sitcom.... with all the worst elements of Hollywood elites* ...the whining about their problems ugh turned into a cynical satirical pity party of pretention...although they do lampoon themselves and celebrity culture to be fair, however it's just the fact that it takes place in that element to begin with that's ironically annoying to me..., I despise the vapid superficiality of celebrity obsession culture and it feels like the celebrity tabloids turned into a cartoon...I can see this being great material to those in the industry that can relate but for me, and Gob bless you if you like it, its a total chore to get through most episodes and is at the bottom of the barrel compared to all the other good animated shows imo, dont waste your time or be duped by the incoceivable hype...., the fact that everybody and their grandma rave about this show is beyond me, I am genuinely baffled, the return on investment in terms of quality does not warrant the watch imho... dont get me wrong, it has its moments and their are a handful of clever well paced episodes where it all comes together (particularly the last 3 episodes of season one) but that's only about 15% of the time...because after this it just sunk back into a lull again...not high enough numbers in a field of top notch competition, sorry, pass The show itself is not really good, sometimes it lacks of good plot and revolves into the same things again and again. Also, I think that they use this as a show for giving a voice to the people that don't make good choices. However, it can be good, and I mean it. There are chapters that are masterpieces.<br/><br/>Particularly, season 4 is a pile of it. But it really gets a lot better in season 5. It has really good character development. Can be quite funny, I especially like Mr Peanutbutter and Princess Carolyne bits. I thoroughly enjoyed the first season sharp and clever script poked fun at many sacred cows
Second season I was told to watch 4 episodes before it gets to the standard of the first,
no I can understand that with the first season of something,but not the second When I watched Bojack Horseman for the first time I thought this TV show was about a great comedy and it really is, but after some episodes I could see the other side of the story. <br/><br/>Bojack is a sad man who everyday wakes up waiting for a lot of people's attention. This show isn't about a funny horse, it's about how people are nowadays. <br/><br/>Anyway don't create expectations if you are looking for an American comedy, of course you will laugh sometimes but Bojack Horseman is a clever story that walks through of the worst things that people has to offer. It is an alright show. I will definitely not watch this show again because it is only good the first time.
The comedy is terrible and makes me cringe (especially Todd). Bojack Horseman is an self destructive and interesting character but very not relatably as he is rich and has done a lot of 'questionably' stuff.
The 2nd part of the last season was disappointing and boring. The first few seasons were good then went downhill fast. The last season was the worst! Won't watch again or suggest to anyone anymore. First of, it's not a bad show. I was able to watch all of it, and it's just not bad. But I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, or a show worth rewatching.<br/><br/>Other than season 1/ maybe 6, the overall plot to each season was just... Bad. I don't know how else to describe it. Again, not that bad cause I am giving it an 8, but definitely not the strong point of the show.<br/><br/>While BoJack does get good development, most other characters other than S1 are just stupid people running around. Dian is ok though.<br/><br/>Loads of people say this show is really deep, but really it has like 3 episodes with a storyline. Also the last two episodes are overrated. Second last episode had no atmosphere and feels to... Understandable and dragged out slightly. The last episode nothing happens. I get it's a character episode, but even that is just people having average conversation. It is still a decent episode, but 9.6? Is it really a Heaven Sent?<br/><br/>I do like, however, the universe of animal people. Also how it's never explained, but it does raise the question of whether all meat they eat is from intelligent life that has been killed, which feels like a slight plot badness.<br/><br/>The main success of the show is the wit of the writers. Everything feels so planned out and comes together in a really satisfing way. For example, Free Burrito. Sometimes the writers will do a quick ego boost by making a character say a bunch of alliterating words, which gets annoying after the first time.<br/><br/>I can tell the writers are good, but they didnt have enough material to make 6 seasons, as while there are highlights most of it is just watchable filler. Yeah, that's how I feel about this, 10/10 until like the last 3-4 episodes, felt kinda like a forced ending but I can't really explain why without massive spoilers so if you don't like the ending I'm sorry but the rest of the how is so amazing it's fine. Never had I ever been touched so deeply by a series, it seemed to me they had to make it with fictive characters otherwise it wouldve simply been TOO real. Made me cry, made me laugh, thaught me lessons, just an allround masterpiece As a man who is suffering from alcoholism and a problem with drugs I can relate to BoJack on many levels, however this show goes beyond that, it has a very high level of wit and the jokes are subtle but brilliant. If you actually look into the depth of the show you'll be able to learn a lot, or at least relate too, many of the characters and in my opinion it goes from strength to strength with each season. I never usually write reviews but it must be said this is such a good show, ignore all the stupid comments like "ugh couldn't even get through the first episode" or, "it sounds dumb" that's just not true when you get in depth with the show it's SoooOo good. It has become my favorite show and it's like it was/is there for me. It's a relatable-ish comforting show. Now that I love the show I want everything Bojack, Bojack phone case, Bojack poster, Bojack mug etc. I thougt it was comedy but OMG !! it s pure draama. Its a great show but after the first two episodes the series took a descent into trying to provoke thought than make us laugh. Netflix's deeply peculiar, depressing animated sitcom continues along with this equally tragi-comic season, which continues its deconstruction of Hollywood with all the savage wit of a Robert Altman movie. The voice work is on point as usual, with Will Arnett proving entirely believable in a surprisingly compelling vocal performance, with superb support from everyone - in particular, Amy Sedaris imbues Princess Caroline with a desperate and broken edge, which stands out even among consistently excellent voice work. Highly recommended for fans of "The Larry Sanders Show" and "The Comeback." This is a very original show, it can also be very funny. Will Arnett plays the main character Bojack, and he is great as always.<br/><br/>The character Dianne is condescending and hypocritical. She is just as screwed up as all of the other characters, but she is completely incapable of acknowledging whenever she is in the wrong.<br/><br/>My favourite character is Todd, who is played by Aaron Paul. He is very funny and likeable. I like the show. Hard-drinking, formerly famous Bojack Horseman returns for a third season to skew the Oscar nominating process and touch on sensitive issues. Will Arnett voices the washed-up anthropomorphic horse who recently starred as Secretariat, or at least was computer- generated to be in the film. His agent Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) works to keep him employed despite his abject laziness and commitment to partying instead of working as an actor. His freeloading roommate Todd (Aaron Paul) pursues various business propositions with a total cluelessness that skews faux pas and leads to little profit. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mr. Peanut Butter (Paul F. Tompkins) and Diane Nguyen (Alison Brie) struggle with their relationship as they deal with an unwanted pregnancy, injuries, and poor career choices. New to this season is Bojack's publicist committed to his Oscar campaign, Ana Spanikopita (Angela Bassett). A romantic relationship blossom between the promiscuous horse and his domineering publicist, but they are fraught with the shallowness of the industry.<br/><br/>There are some pretty funny episodes like a silent one undersea where Bojack attempts to return a seahorse to its father, an entire episode on the phone with a newspaper saleswoman, and a bender flashing-forward through blackouts. From the vapidness of celebrities using abortions for fame to the violation of safe spaces to drug addiction, Bojack Horseman does not stray away from controversial issues while continuing to deliver silly animal puns about Hollywood, spoofed here as Hollywoo. <br/><br/>After season 4 The depressed and narcissistic horse who was once famous for a television career is back with another hilarious season of hijinks and interesting storytelling. Bojack Horseman (Will Arnett) has left his life in Los Angeles behind to hideout in an abandoned house of his grandparents while keeping up a bender of alcohol and drugs. Bojack has really escalated in the past few seasons and it is so funny with thousands of witty jokes each season. The show also has a nice mixture of drama from these outrageous characters. Bojack's struggle with addiction is traced back from his upbringing under the harsh criticism of his mother Beatrice (Wendie Malick). The history of Beatrice Sugarman and how she came to be a mother is slowly told through flashbacks and a full episode of jumping memories near the end of the season.<br/><br/>Without Bojack's presence initially, the other characters move on in their own way. Diane Nguyen (Alison Brie) is the only one wondering where Bojack is and she constantly leaves him messages about what is happening in her life. She is working at a blog desperate for clicks while trying to write more serious stories. Her husband Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins) has decided on a whim to run for governor of California against the current governor Woodchuck Coochuck-Berkowitz (Andre Braugher). Lampooning of politics can feel too limited with the absurdity of what's actually going on, but Mr. Peanutbutter silly commitments to issues like fracking cause hilarious hijinks. When he agrees to frack in his backyard, his house collapses into a hole while he hosts a celebrity donor party.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com You might be wondering why the main character has the head of a horse. The answer is: I don't really know. But one of the most unique things about this show is that many of the characters in this show are animals, with human characteristics. The main character is BoJack Horseman, who stands on two legs and has a human voice. This is the same for Bojack's agent, who is a cat, and his biggest rival, who is a dog.<br/><br/>But whats even stranger, is that the humans in this cartoon are not even slightly phased by how most of the people in their world, are animals. It is completely normal to be friends with a walking/talking chicken, or have a boss who is a gigantic frog.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very entertaining show and I'm looking forward to the second season.
