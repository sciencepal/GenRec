Seriously the first half of it was the one of the best things I've ever watched in my whole life. The psychological warfare was brilliant and the show had me on the edge of my seat at every single moment. And once L died, everything went downhill. Light turned into an absolute physcopath and it was almost unbelievably stupid of him to fall in Nears trap. Near was nowhere nearly as smart as L or Light, yet she had the last laugh. If the second half would've continued like the first half, this would be the best show ever made. This is anime at its best. I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric "L" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected "Kira" or "Killer" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, "Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper," but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.<br/><br/>This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a change of pace in anime. It's not for everyone, of course since it's more of an intellectual thriller and not so much an action fantasy, but anyone who can appreciate the mental challenge of following along with this suspenseful battle of wits will be in heaven with Death Note. This is good. I don't watch anime. I watched all of this. It is very good. After watching the first six episodes, I find that the story line is very well though out. Unlike many series, Death Note has a way of keeping ahead of the watcher, and one can never predict what is about to happen. <br/><br/>The series is obviously dark. One of the things that I find interesting about Death Note that the protagonist isn't the good guy, like that of the stereotypical protagonist. The fact that this series goes morally were few others will go is definitely one of the reasons I find this series to be so enticing.<br/><br/>I'm definitely hooked! The first time I heard of Death Note was from a youtube channel Hello Future Me and his storytelling analyses. Previously I had resented anime as childish and totally weird-looking, but after Timothy took Death Note as an example of a good story-beat management, I was wiling to give it a shot. And boy, was I hooked.<br/><br/>Never before have I seen any show try to copy that sherlock-ey way of thinking and incorporate it so cleverly with mystery and fantasy elements. Death Note has such an unique feel to it that no other anime has... every moment Light's and L's theme play, I get slight goosebumps while wondering who will outsmart whom next. It is a matter of simple beauty seeing the writers play with the contrast of Light's and L's personality, making them grow close while simultaneously growing further apart. Ant to top it off with so much symbolism and biblical references in the final episode of L's saga is a matter of pure perfection.<br/><br/>Yes, people will say that the second part sucks. Truth be told, even though it may not be equally as engaging as the first one, I wouldn't say it was unbearable either. The fact is that by this point Light is so cornered that he cannot operate on his own; therefore the tension is dissipated towards minor characters and Near that we don't get enough time to care about. Nonetheless, seeing Light maneuver through all the traps Near sets for him provides a proper build-up towards the eagerly expected end.<br/><br/>And about the end... I really felt for Light in those final moments. Part of me didn't want the series to end the way it did, simply because Light was the embodiment of my answer to the fundamental questions of justice that stem from Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment. As much as I may be a follower of Kira in one part of my mind, I also cannot deny that Near is absolutely right - Light Yagami is just another serial killer; nothing more and nothing less.<br/><br/>Death note is the first of all the animated series that has introduced me with the fact that not all things animated have to have a happy ending. Think of it, how many western-animation movies do you know that do not end on a happy note? Very few would be my guess. And from this time on, my journey through japanese animation has started. I couldn't be more grateful for the way it began and therefore, Death Note will always be the No. 1 anime I will recommend to people new to anime. If you haven't seen it yet, I really do not know what you are waiting for...<br/><br/>... btw I hear the bells. Do you? From the pages of the manga to the silver screen and then to the small screen. Manga = breathtaking, Film = groundbreaking, Anime = phenomenal.<br/><br/>Death Note the anime is one of the best animes to come out for a very long time. The storyline is amazing but not complicated or cliché. Like the film and manga, it depicts the cat and mouse hunt between L and Light on who will uncover one another's identity.<br/><br/>Death Note is a cake; everything good about a cake; and therefore people should see this landmark. Overall, Death Note will remain a classic forever... if the Americans don't remake and ruin it!!!<br/><br/>10/10 Honestly, I'm not a regular anime viewer but I rather consider this show as live action due to its realistic nature and I really love it from core of my heart. Just♥ it This show just keeps getting better and better! Every episode has a new twist, and is never the same as the last! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you will watch it again and again! The story is centered around a young man, Yagami Raito/Light who finds a "Death Note". I won't tell you anymore about this "Death Note" (as that would spoil it). With this "Death Note" he sets about ridding the world of evil and creating a "Utopia", with himself as the new god. Filled with interesting characters, lots of intelligent dialouge and exiting plot twists, this show is definitely on my top 10! I would Highly recommend it to anyone, those who enjoy crime/psychological/dark themes. I have seen many anime but few compare to Death Note. It provides it's viewers with incredible characters, a deep storyline, and view of how power can corrupt. The focus of the story is on Yagami Light, a college student who is feed-up with what he considers a rotting world. He soon finds a notebook named "Death Note." The instructions state that any human whose name is written in the Death Note will die as long as the person who writes the victim's name has the victim's face in mind at that time. While Light considers it to be a foolish prank, his curiosity gets the best of him. Upon learning that the Death Note is real, Light realizes he has the chance to rid the world of crime and create a new world over which he reigns supreme. The story of Death Note follows Light as he tries to create his new world, and the forces that try to stop him. Perhaps one of the most interesting elements of the series is that the main character is neither a hero or an anti-hero but instead an anti-villain. This an excellent series that is guaranteed to leave viewers in awe. I will be short, the series is a gem: character buildup, screenwriting, tension, drama, art, cinematography, everything. Truly captivating story...<br/><br/>...until (without spoiling it) the main story arc ends quite anticlimactically and new subplot begins with new characters in the primal focus. The latter half takes away a hint of brilliance from rest of the story.<br/><br/>Still I would recommend it! I watched one episode and thought the first episode wasn't pretty good, but when i started too watch(watching episode 11 now) i started too love it, its genius and the guy who made this movie got too be one of the smartest filmmaker ever, The animation is one of the best, the story is smart, deep and exemplary written , the characters are interesting, i can gladly say i haven't found one error in this series, so even if you don't watch much anime i just recommend you too watch this and i can swear that you will like it, i think this is as good as elfen lied(or even better). The story is about a guy named light who is top-student and smartest guy in school(without being a geek), one day some kind of diary named ''death note'' falls down from the sky and he picks it up, and then the story begins.. a must see for everyone!!!<br/><br/>10/10 <ul><li>All Together - 96/100 (Favorite Episode: Silence)</li></ul><br/><br/>_________________________________<br/><br/>⭐⭐⭐Screenplay: 98/100<br/><br/>⭐⭐⭐Film Editing: 97/100<br/><br/>⭐⭐Original Scores: 93/100<br/><br/>_________________________________<br/><br/>Really good details on script. Deeply amazing, brilliant storyline. The New World rises with Kira. The best anime ever. This is just summarizes Japanese brain. If you watched Netflix Death Note you can understand the difference... This manga is exceptional: smart, captivating and suspenseful. The script is up to the drawings: astonishing and entertaining. I loved it! Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome series. From the first episode you can note the well characterized characters, incredible production and direction by MadHouse, the good tone and a story that can be interesting for casual viewers and for smarter people. The constant fight between Kira and L was the point where the series harnessed its potential, you know, THE SERIES STAYED ALIVE BECAUSE OF IT and it was damn awesome, you were always thinking what Kira would do next and what would L do to catch him, it was unpredictable in a good way and fascinating.<br/><br/>This was until episode 25 unfortunately, and everything just goes down. Without L, Light feels so distant from the viewer making the next events monotonous and boring to watch,he suddenly starts acting like an impulsive idiot that betrayes his previous character, and about Near, it seems like a plot device being just there for finishing what L started. There's no personality or characterization in him, so it's a nonsense. And then we get to the final episode, Light seems he's going to win but you know what? Let's make an stupid and forced situation where Mikami has the stupid idea to leave the note in a place like the bank. Are you serious? After we saw Light's elaborated plan to hide it in the first episodes, Why didn't he tell him to do that? What I hate from this is that they tell you that Mikami is a very intelligent and metodic guy, but he acts like a fool making decisions without Light's orders. Forced, convenient, inconsistent and rushed.<br/><br/>Death Note starts as an incredible and smart show, then they took the smart part and got rid of it. On it's defense, I have to say that the second half isn't too long to ruin the series, so it goes from being a masterpiece to just a very good show.<br/><br/>8/10 In the first episode, you can already see the amazing animation, the well-chosen voices, the immediate gripping of fear over the future in your chest. Death Note is a must-see for those who love to have a good 5 minutes of thinking because Death Note beautifully weaves suspense and unexpected turn of events that leaves the audience stunned and fascinated.<br/><br/>You'll notice the good production, but to truly decide whether it's worth watching you will have to watch to the 2nd (and for those who are stubborn, the 3rd) episode. If you are planning to watch this for a limited of time, you're in luck because the series is only 37 episodes long since the manga already ended.<br/><br/>While the IQ of the two main characters is straight-out impossible, you still cannot feel but admire just how logical their reasons for making possibilities and theories are (what makes it even scarier is that most of the theories that L or Light, the two protagonists, are true). If you are one who watches things from a personal view, you would have a hard time deciding whether the things they are doing are right and if they are, in reality, insane.<br/><br/>There is slight humor that adds faint scratches on the anime, but it is soon covered up in the next minute with what a character has done or said. There was not a moment where I wasn't sitting at the edge of my seat, my eyes literally sticking to the screen. Every minute is worth watching, even the sinister theme songs played by Nightmare.<br/><br/>What makes this anime/manga unique is that it's a mystery thriller where you hardly question the origins of something. You rarely ask yourself unanswerable questions (not even in the back of your mind) and without realizing, you're only focused on the present events.<br/><br/>I promise, no matter what kind of audience you are, you will be gripped by this chilling life and death chain of events of a bored genius who kills criminals mercilessly with the mysterious Death Note. This review does not contain any spoilers. It is OK to read this. I only mention "L".<br/><br/>The first half is absolutely absolutely superb. I call this the "L saga". When you watch it, you will clearly know when it ends. I recommend you stop there. I wish I did. It's the halfway point of the series. The main characters story really does end there. But to show some moral lessons they put in another half to show that "good through evil isn't good". All world governments and empires disagree with this, so why did this show have to forcefully fabricate new stories in the second half. It totally ruined it. It takes away from the characters that had been established.<br/><br/>Due to the first half being the best thing I have ever ever seen, I give this 9 stars. Even though the second half was so bad I should reduce it to 5 stars. I have to say two things turned me off. First is the idiot reviewer on the front page who feels the need to use 70% of his review(even titled it "Eat Your Heart Out Naruto"-really subtle) to bash Naruto like some insecure 12 year old spoiled brat fan boy. Pathetic. The second was that it sounded like some Gothic action anime from others. However when I finally saw it I thought, meh, okay. However as it went on I got more and more drawn in.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough to start:successful and brilliant student Light stumbles upon the Death Note, which will kill anyone who's name he writes down provided it's their real name and he knows his face. He experiments with it and sees that it's real. He plays with the other rules all the while killing other criminals and meeting up with the shinigami who wrote the death note. The deaths of these criminals does not go unnoticed as the renound and mysterious detective El is trying to discover who Light, under the name Kira, is. Whoever finds the other's identity first will win in this power struggle.<br/><br/>Like I said, the first episode is interesting enough. The story however develops and becomes better and more complex as it goes on. The moral ambiguity of the anime gives it a unique feel among others of it's kind. I was shocked to see a show like this under Shounen jump which usually host anime that combine strong actions scenes with a complex plot and character development. What we have here instead is an anime that dosen't have adrenaline pumping action scenes advancing the plot(not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact I enjoy that as well) but the proverbial chess game between Light and the police as Light becomes well aware the police are after him as he does everything possible to hide himself all the while continuing to do away with criminals at his whim.<br/><br/>Ryuk, the shinigami who follows Light, actually provies some of the comic relief of the show believe it or not. He's not over the top goofy by any means however if there's any laughs to be derived, it's usually from him.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of Shounen Jump anime, you should give Death Note a try. It easily rivals the majority of thriller films. It is well worth your time. I haven't read all the manga's, but from what I've read of the mangas and seen in the anime, this is one of the finest and truest conversions I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The show somehow creates a great sense of action without a ton of mecha and ninjas and also contains a lot of well crafted tension. This is an intelligent triller with some great characters which thankfully isn't full of anime clichés! As with most great shows, let alone animes, as the story progresses and more intriguing characters are introduced the quality rises and you become hooked.<br/><br/>I highly recommend checking out at least a few episodes to see how it sits with you. A lot of anime have a completely different feel from its peers and its worth giving some of them a chance to progress a little before dismissing them. No spoilers... This show has a great starting foothold. The mixing between mythical fantasy world of god of death and police detective story line is brilliant, just works brilliantly.
But as the story grows the details on how things work out gets blurry and un logical character decision making happens more and more often
But overall very enjoyable despite the weak finish, and oddly i am hoping there is a death note 2 Death Note is a show that explores the ideas of justice from two completely different characters' viewpoints. L's is perspective is that Kira (Light) is in fact childish psychopathic killer. Who has a childish view of right, and wrong. Due to Light's actions killing criminals effect progress of our society. Not to mention Light killed many innocent people who were wrongfully convicted of a crime. The cat, and mouse game is absolutely delightful. The clear focus of character's thoughts, and actions is extremely well thought out. Characters have flaws, look and acts like real characters. Death Note has consequences within the story that slowly builds within the series. The series starts off great. There are around 5 excellently developed characters; there's a great premise; the plot develops logically and compellingly; the pacing of building tension then action is spot on. You've got a unique feel, and some moral dilemma action thought-provoking action. Everything has a balanced and cohesive feel - pretty much everything you'd expect when you see a series rated 8.9.<br/><br/>*I have to warn a very slight plot spoil, but I won't give anything remotely specific.* <br/><br/>Then about halfway through the series, to solve some stagnation they throw in a good dose of anticlimax. Now the majority of the interesting characters stop getting any screen time for various reasons and follow up by introducing and then disposing of characters you never have any reason to care about. The very ending was well done. (Pity it wouldn't make sense if you just skipped the 15 episodes preceding it!)<br/><br/>Maybe the manga developed all of the lame characters in the second half and had I first read all of them I would have enjoyed it all, but still... I just can't justify how sloppy everything got. Compare with either of the Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, or Code Geass if you can tolerate mecha action, and you'll see where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>It either needed to be around 20-25 episodes and finish off strong without all of the later stuff, of have been extended to at least 50 so that they could have developed the last half into something workable. It is very special and unique and it makes thing about life and the way we live. Police story and a lot of action. This truly got me stuck staring at the screen. Amazing story. I have never watched anime but i finally made myself give Death Note a chance. A choice I do not regret! Truly a must watch. WOW. Death Note might very well be the very best TV shows I have ever seen. The anime is very well made also. It has a very intellectual side to it, because you never know who is gonna win the battle. Death Note presents a contest of wits between Light Yagami, who can kill criminals from the privacy of his bedroom, and the detectives seeking his identity, who know only that criminals are dying under mysterious circumstances and that they too might be killed from afar if their identities become known. As a psychological thriller, the action of this series is almost entirely mental or conversational, as each antagonist attempts to out-think the other: taking risks which might reveal their enemies' identities, or expose their own. Also interesting are the many moral quandaries the series poses. MUST WATCH! If you are looking for a good Anime to start with , this is it An absolute perfection an awesome game of cat and mouse with the edge of darkness, cleverness and clash of morals with each of characters <br/><br/>Each and everything done in this story arc has a purpose nothing will feel out of content and it's so good after 3 episodes it will become an addiction I saw it only because I didn't have anything else to do, and till this day I am glad that I did.<br/><br/>No doubt it is a popular anime, I had seen some screen shots on different sites and my first impression of it was ' A Gothic guy killing people with a notebook', but I was in fact wrong.<br/><br/>It is the most intelligent thing I have seen in my life, it was the first anime that I saw and the only one of it's kind.<br/><br/>Just watch the first few episodes and you will lose yourself, no big thing even if you become an addict.<br/><br/>Ever since I finished the anime, I have been on a quest to find more but unfortunately I couldn't.<br/><br/>Once you are done with this you might want to see "Code Geass", if Death Note is a 10 then Code Geass is definitely a 9. Death Note is about a high school genius, named Light Yagami, who finds a notebook that allows the user to kill anyone they wish (as long as the user has the person's name and face in mind) by writing their name in the notebook. Light decides to use this power to kill anyone he deems criminal or unworthy of life. Light's continuous killings eventually attract the attention of the genius detective who is only known as L (L doesn't show his face or reveal any information about himself for most of the show). Light figures in order to be completely safe, he needs to eliminate L. The show then becomes a clever game of cat and mouse between two masterminds and it's incredible. You never know exactly what the other is going to do and you don't know if L will capture Light or if Light will kill L. It's absolutely riveting and this is the fantastic part of the show. The second half of the show sucks, for lack of a better word. Without spoiling anything here are the main problems: 1: Some new characters are introduced and none of them are likable. 2: The clever cat and mouse formula gets lost somewhere and the show loses interest. And 3: The ending is wrong, bad, stupid, and I don't like it.You'll see what I mean when you get there. So, Death Note is only good. It could have fantastic, but the second half of the show happened and it became simply a good show. If you only want the good parts watch episodes 1-26. Skip 27-37. I know I'm really late but this was amazing. Light is probably one of the best villains that also happens to be the protagonist. He was despicable and a psychopath that thought himself a God. It was chilling to watch him transform into Kira because he was willing to kill anyone that stood in his way. I enjoyed every second of it. If I could make a comparison, the dynamic between Light and L is similar to that between Hannibal and Will in the tv show Hannibal. This anime kept me on my toes in every episode as Light outsmarted the people who were against Kira, until he was eventually outsmarted. I kind of wished that Light would've won in the end but honestly the ending meant that nobody but Ryuk won. Ryuk had the most fun being around Light and it was only right that Ryuk was the one who took Light's life. It had come full circle and it was a little bittersweet to see this end. Best anime of all time. That's basically all I have to say. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED This anime was the first anime I've watched. I've always hated those sharp shaped anime ðŸ˜‚ characters . Sorry anime fans.<br/><br/>But boy after just watching the first episode I just binge watched the entire anime in one sitting .<br/><br/>I personally liked when L was alive I think the show kinda reached downfall from the point but it's still great tho.<br/><br/>Watch it if you are new to anime . I really thought that riyuk would write the names of Near and his fellow agents along with Fellow members of Light to save light and sacrifice himself. If this would have actually happen in the anime this would have been a masterpiece. I hated that Light died. Probably the best suspense thriller out there the storyline the characters everything was perfect One of my only gripes is that L's death was off screen kinda lame. It was a weird jump very jarring. "Hello my names matsuda" This is my favorite anime. It's perfect. L and Kira are awesome This is an ideal introduction to the world of anime , extraordinary development of characters with little to no plot holes . An anime which will always be watched by non-amine lover.
A series which everyone should watch... The series and its premises is really exciting, but this series has the same problem I feel many anime series has, too many episodes. <br/><br/>Even at 37 (or something), it's just 10 too many. After seeing them the pattern is all too clearly, like a thorn in the side, it just screams "bad story writing". <br/><br/>The entire series goes like this:<br/><br/>Protagoninst: Haha, I have this super plan that no one can stop. Arch enemy: AhAha, but I knew you would do that, so I did this. Now I got you! Protagonist: HAHA HA! I knew you knew I knew! So instead I did this! Arch enemy: WELL!!! I knew that you knew that I knew, so therefor I did this!! Also, f**k you! Repeat...<br/><br/>And this goes on for every episode. Killing off the main opponent was a bold move, but replacing him with an identical kid, just younger, just didn't give anything story wise, you could have just kept "L" and the story would have been the same. If it hadn't been for that kid they could have taken the last episode and aired it whenever they wanted and no one would have reacted. "Death Note" is simply one of the best anime series from the recent years, having an outstanding animation, very interesting characters and a magnificent plot, filled with many unpredictable and surprising plot twists, keeping a high level of tension from the beginning until the ending of the story.<br/><br/>The main premise of this series was pretty attractive and very well developed, making a great use of some supernatural elements in a realistic context.<br/><br/>The motivations and psychology of the characters are portrayed in a very convincing manner: Their complex personality's serves as the main core of the plot development, resulting in one of the most fascinating mystery series ever made in the history of television.<br/><br/>The animation is simply excellent: Not only the character's designs are beautifully made (Having all those designs many subtle details which are able to combine realism with the stylish characteristics from the anime aesthetic) but also has a flawless atmosphere, which captures perfectly well the overall mood of this series. The use of colors and light effects is equally brilliant, keeping a high quality level in all the episodes. The voice acting and the music are pretty effective, complementing the greatness of the plot and the animation.<br/><br/>"Death Note" deserved all the hype and praise that it received, being one of the most brilliant television shows that I've ever watched. It would be the perfect series if it wasn't for one little detail: Misa Amane. She is one of the most annoying characters ever made, and she feels totally out of place in the context of this series. I know that there is too much hate directed toward other characters (Such as Mello and Near) but none of them were so irritating and dumb as Misa. Maybe is just me, but I feel like this character were from a completely different anime, and that's the main reason why I don't like her very much.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is a magnificent series, which I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this yet. Regarded as one of the best anime series ever created, and I completely agree. I highly recommend this to anyone that's either new to anime, or just hasn't seen it yet. The voice acting for both sub and dub is phenomenal, the animation is spectacular, the story is very intriguing, all the characters are very well-developed, and the music is literally perfect.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 9.8/10 (Amazing) The storyline is totally different for a Japanese anime series. An insociable nerd who has the power to cause death and a mysterious detective with a sweet tooth who works in the shadows. It's a great show, until L dies. It should have ended there. I hate every episode past L's death. I just watched all the 37 episodes after some friends recommended the series. I am not sure why I watched them all, to be honest. Really unlikable characters, same things happening over and over again, with some rare twists that are not even that brilliant. I am completely ignorant of the anime world, and this might be considered good. But it never happened to me to be so utterly indifferent about the main characters (especially after the time jump). So watch it if you really don't have anything better to do, or if you really like egocentric and self-loving, arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous characters who try to defeat "mistrerious" and brooding ones by "manipulating" an army of weak and stupid (by the main character's own definition) ones. I checked out Death Note because I had seen a couple of episodes on Adult Swim way back and had been intrigued by the premise but never caught it from the beginning and wanted to see what all the hype was about. While the series is entertaining and wasn't necessarily a waste of my time, it fell short from being a masterpiece for me for several reasons.<br/><br/>The characters and their motivations are simple and static. They barely develop if at all throughout the show. Light is the same from beginning to end: a brilliant sociopath with a black and white sense of justice and a God complex. L is the equally brilliant oddball detective not above taking unorthodox and unethical measures to take Kira/Light down. That's about it for the two most interesting characters in the show. Everyone else is even more one note or if they are interesting or have potential, they are disposed of. These characters have no shades of gray no complex or conflicting emotions, what you see is what you get. <br/><br/>Just as simple as the characters is the plot. There are a lot of plot points and details in the schemes of the characters that make it seem like the plot is convoluted but it really isn't. Light wants to rid the world of criminals so that he can rule it like a God. When L and the police start investigating to bring him down, he focuses on covering his identity as Kira and bringing down the task force before they can bring him down. The cat and mouse game between two geniuses is what the whole show boils down to. The rules of the Death Note and the different players that come in and out keep the routine from becoming stale, but the plot is straight forward, the sides are clear, the stakes don't change.<br/><br/>Then there are some plot point actions where characters do irrational things to either secure Light or the task force a win. For example Light's big plan to throw suspicion off of him relies on two Shinigami following through on a plan that they have no incentive to follow through on because one said he wouldn't get involved and the other hates Light, yet she goes and helps him anyway because? Then the last part of the series has one character just figuring out every key detail that identifies Light as Kira with no explanation as to how they drew all of those conclusions.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the show is still entertaining as long as you ignore all of these shortcomings and don't think too much about what you are watching and if you are expecting this show to deliver a message about morality or justice or have any depth. It could have offered so much more and been a true masterpiece, but just doesn't do enough. So I started to watch this show years ago but somehow I forgot about it and stopped watching after a few episodes and recently my friends started talking about it so I thought I'd re watch it all. This show starts off great and would have to say the first 12 episodes are amazing.. music is so good too! After that it gets a little confusing and you kinda think to yourself that it's repeating itself over and over and what could happen next but then a few more episodes in and it drags you back in for more. Friends told me it gets boring after the first few episodes but I would have it gets better! Overall great TV show one of the best animes you'll ever watch One of the best anime ever. Light is a sort of "Walter White" from "Breaking Bad". He is the protagonist and the antagonist at the same time. He wants to reach something good by playing an evil game. At the beginning we can see a normal boy who wants to create a new better world, but after L's death, we can see a change in Light's personality. He becomes more cruel and without consciousness. He can kill everyone who stands in his way, even his family. L is one of the best anime characters I've ever seen. His abnormality makes him a man without feelings who only wants to play a game. He is not even frightened by the possibility of loosing his own life. This two characters keep the world in an equilibrium that breaks after L's death. L and Light also share a mutual respect for each other knowing that only they know the truth. They could have been friends or even lovers, regarding the fact that they both never felt something for girls (I know it's a stupid thing to say, but maybe it's true), if not for the Death Note. While now the only thing they can do is to hate each other. That's because, as L said, they are both childish and hate to lose.<br/><br/>The directing is very good and highly watchable. The atmosphere is very dark and obscure from the beginning, as it has to be.<br/><br/>I also think that this anime has one of the greatest soundtracks I've ever heard.<br/><br/>10/10 Absolute pure F****** brilliance. I wont lie, my knowledge of anime is not great and this is one of the few I have seen, and, embarrassingly enough, I haven't even seen Akira (please don't hurt me Anime fans). However, when I watched Death Note, I am more captivated than almost any other movie or show on lately. I got the first 4 episodes on Disc about 4 weeks ago, and now I am up to Episodes 14-16, and I am still captivated. The stories are extremely complex and multi-layered with great discusser issues to it, and great characters. Nobody ever feels safe, you honestly believe anyone of them could die at any turn, and the stories are very well paced, thought out and believable. Another great part of the series is the Music, the music works very well and gives you a early feeling of the type of show you are witnessing. Also, the animation is very top rate, it looks brilliant and is very convincing. The introduction of L, of Misa and Rem, of the Universitie episodes where Light and L meet, the whole issue of both Kira's, the story gets better and better, and each episode whets your appetite for more. It would be interesting to see how it would have been if this was a Live-Action series, but then again, don't look a gift-horse in the mouth. Truly brilliant series, and deserves recognition all over the world. Well, A friend is mine told my about this new anime series called Death Note. So i got my hands on the first few episode and i was completely blown away. Im actually not that anime freak and i don't watch TV series at all, but this one really got me. The Story begins with a young man finding a book, which kills people once their name has been written down in it. Using the note to purge the world from criminals he soon has to use it to remain undiscovered. Because after the police found out that there is one man killing other people on purpose they try to find him with the help of a genius profiler named L. <br/><br/>I don't wanna spoil too much so i wont say anything more about the storyline. However, this series is one of the most intelligent and original stories I've ever seen and even non-anime fans should definitely check this one out. A modern classic. This is like the Prison Break or 24 amongst anime. Every episode is building up a certain tension, leading to the most nerve wrecking cliffhangers you can imagine. It fuels the drive for its viewers to watch the next episode as soon as possible. And I think that's the best thing about this show; the addictiveness of it. <br/><br/>It is also a nice intellectuel ''chess'' game between great minds, the evil Kira and the noble L., both making their moves one at a time, trying to defeat the other one with cunning plans. At a certain point the story takes a slightly different approach by introducing some new characters that join this game. Most of my friends hate this, but I think it refreshens the battle between Kira and L. and gives it a new dimension. I can't be more specific without spoiling the plot. <br/><br/>On a deeper layer it asks a philosophical question: is it alright to kill rapists and murderers without any trial? Will it make our world a better place? Answering that question may well spoil the show for you, so I'd suggest you better go watch it! This is anime in optima forma! If there is one thing that Death Note has, it's a creative concept that could really lead to some very deep and interesting concepts. The show could've been deep and profound... HOWEVER it has nothing to say. While this isn't always bad, it just means this show is nothing but pointless entertainment. There is nothing truly unique about the show because it doesn't take the extra step to actually have a point.<br/><br/>First let's get to the plot holes: This show has a lot and this is one of the worst things about this show: the character's will have huge shifts in character just to force the plot in a certain direction. This is frustrating because there are multiple occasions when Light should've been caught but huge character changes (or coincidences) occurred kept him from being caught. If Light is going to escape then I want him to escape fairly. No bending the rules. No forced plot. However, this series constantly forces the world to its will to make sure everything goes in a certain direction. This is cheap, unfair, and unsatisfying to the viewer.<br/><br/>Imagine the ending to Thor 2. Why did the spears kill the bad guy in Thor 2 if the red mist was clearly established to protect him like a shield. Imagine if in the The Lord of The Rings the ring got destroyed by dropping it off of a 20 foot drop... even when it was established it was nearly invincible. This show doesn't do this once or twice, no, it does this CONSTANTLY. It will establish rules that are crucial to the survival of the characters and then it will break those rules just to throw in a "plot-twist". This is a blunder if anything else, because plot-twists only work if it fits in the plot. The show acts like it is being really clever but it isn't.<br/><br/>Little plot-holes I noticed was: If someone dies by suicide, what is to make them die immediately? Couldn't the person go off and kill Kira and then commit suicide? How was Rem able to kill Watarai when that is clearly helping a human out? Why did Ryuk have a sudden character change of helping Light find the cameras even when before and after that episode he says that he won't help out? Why did Chief Yagami kill the thugs without giving them the right to surrender? This goes against his character. How did ANYONE survive the blast from that gang raid? Why in the WORLD WOULD THE COPS UNBUG LIGHT WHEN HE IS THEIR TOP SUSPECT!!! SERIOUSLY, HE IS THEIR NUMBER ONE SUSPECT AND WHEN LIGHT SAYS "unbug me" they unbug him. That is an example of a terrible character change/alteration. The characters were clearly established as thinking Light is their number one suspect, but when Light says "unbug me... you know... just because" they do it... how stupid.<br/><br/>Trust me, there are a lot more.<br/><br/>The other major issue with this show is that it is incredibly tedious. The same things happen in this fashion: Light is smart, someone chasing Light is smart, Light becomes friend with the chaser, chaser dies, Light is smart, someone chasing Light is smart, Light becomes friend with the chaser, chaser dies. The show throws in character after useless character that do nothing but just buy time for the show to be longer. Many "new and unexpected" characters start joining the show, but for very little purpose other than to make the show longer and bigger in scale.<br/><br/>Overall, Death Note has some good in it, but it also has a lot of bad. The premise is a great one and a lot of the supporting cast (L, Near, Mello) are all very interesting and intriguing characters, the rest of the cast is dull and boring. Light has almost no motivation other than "because I want to" which makes him incredibly 2-dimensional. Why should we care about Light? He has no interesting qualities, he has no "views" and he has no personality other than being "smart". He is a walking plot-device. Even worse, his henchman (who's name escapes me) is an exact duplicate of Light but even more dull. It is a guy who is just obsessed with Kira and has a really stupid back-story: "I kill people because I realized that students in High-School were mean". <br/><br/>The good parts of the show are mainly in its premise and a few of its really well done characters. Other than that, it turns out to be fairly disappointing and frustrating to watch. Everything was perfect from episode 1st to 16th episode, 17th episode was a bridge for next bad and chaildish episodes, 18th episode was sucks and boring until 23th episode. 24th and 25th epidoes was just a little bit worse than 1-16th episodes. everything changes when L died. after 25th episodes was sucks and super boring! The N who is the new L was just a little similar with Real L but it was still sucks and childish! I thoroughly enjoyed the game of cat and mouse between Light and L, but after L kicks it the show loses its luster. The game could only go on for so long, and in my opinion the show should have ended with L's demise. The show is a great psychological thriller with almost every scene including some incredible tension. The show is amazing up until the death of the MC's main rival. Then it falls off and has many episodes that leave you feeling underwhelmed. The ending is a bit disappointing as well, although it's an overall great series and recommend that you check it out. If you decide to watch the series and like the main character at all, stop watching at episode 25. The last episode ruined what could have been a true masterpiece. Light acts completely out of character and makes some truly stupid mistakes when we were shown throughout the series he was a genius. The L ripoff named Near made utterly ridiculous assumptions that were always correct which led to lights "defeat" and then he has the audacity to claim that he surpassed L. What a joke. If you disregard lights poor final plan, N won due to complete luck and a stupid mistake of lights subordinate. So disappointing to see the "good always beats evil" cliche ruin a show that definitely would have been better without it. This is totally absolute great series... I never saw such a thrill movies. Every step there was a lot of mysteries revealed and obviously L is the finest characters above all of them. I think you should watch this..... Really interesting.... Gives a complete mystery who will win... Sometimes even makes my heart skip a beat This is best anime i have ever watched and the ending is emotional really i love the character of light and also misa and light's sister and mother also No words!! One of the best anime till now!! The graphics are dope considering the year of release! Coming to the background music, this anime is just an another name of perfection!!!! Amazing story line and plot!! There's only a few --good-- series in world history, in which the lead character isn't, actually, a heroe that everyone's loves. The very opposite way, Death Note can considerate itself as pioneer of anti-heroes plots, back then in 2007. Kira-sama will ALWAYS be remembered as one of the most hated/loved, ICONICS anti-heroes of all time (just as Lelouch or Walter White). And not a simple villian we're talking here, but the Judas figure himself.<br/><br/>The "God" complex twisted sense of justice takes form in a brilliant, charismatic, high-class privileged japanese young student; Yagami Light. But yet, there can't be darkness without light (paradoxically).
And so, there's the antithesis of Kira (but not necesary a heroe...); L, Lawliet; a gifted, lonely young investigator who will challenge Kira's vision of his "perfect world", in a intelectual, strategy game to death, or untill one's identity is revealed.<br/><br/>You'll not only be moved by this anime show, but you'll be forced to use your head so you can understand how the Death Note strategy game to death, works for each character. Mystic, esoteric, religious and even philosophical content will be featured. But most of all, the Heaven and Hell concepts will be mentioned a few, but very important times.<br/><br/>So, if you considerate yourself a smart-cookie fan of intellectual series, go watch inmediately. I am the god of the new world . I am justice. Iam Kira Needless to say that I was never an anime person, and when friends were talking about it I loose interest. I kept hearing about Death Note and because they are short episodes I took the time to engage. WOW!!! in only 20 min. I was hooked and each episode keeps getting better. <br/><br/>The characters are clever and they will stimulate your mind. Just when you think there is no coming out of this one the characters take a different route that the spectator does not expect. It is very easy to watch because the episodes are short. I am on the 11th episode and I still haven't come across a boring one. Now I can say I am an anime fan, Death note has changed my perspective. <br/><br/>:-) I am a fan of animes and I watch diverse varieties of them, mostly the the ones with the highly praised. So, I decided to watch Death Note. Everyone was talking about how geniusly written it is, how great is the battle of two of the greatest minds, how it is suspenseful etc...<br/><br/>I watched the whole series, but I really don't get it. The idea of some mortal boy finding a death god's notebook and using it to create a crime-free "Utopia" is genius. However, the writing of this anime is not genius at all, as most people saying. Actually, it has very dumb logical flaws in the base of its story. Until the last episode, I waited to see that jaw dropping moments, but there were none.<br/><br/>Let me explain: The so-called genius boy Yagami Light finds a death note and wants to erase crime from world by killing criminals. That's okay. However, he kills small time criminals like murderers, rapists etc. The genius isn't able to think about the big guys who finances crime and creates the environment the crime thrives in. For a genius, he's pretty dumb. Making the world crimes by this way requires hundreds, even thousands of those death notes, there are hundreds of thousands small time criminals. A genius would have go after big corporations and organizations which promote crime, and corrupt politicians who sides with rich and powerful, instead of righteous.<br/><br/>Another thing about Yagami is, aside from his intelligence, that he's a normal person, having a normal life until finding that death note. He has a good family, he is successful student, he didn't have a psychological trauma caused by a criminal. Then the minute he found that notebook, he turns into cold hearted killer. He even uses the girl who loves him, just to learn more names to write to death note. The only time shows signs of emotions, when he writes to death note and at the end he got caught. If he doesn't have any compassion in his heart, why does he want to rid the world free of crime? <br/><br/>Now, let's talk about "L the genius detective". He's more than a genius, he must be a psychic. From the first time he gets the case of dying criminals, he gets after "the" killer. Criminals are dying of heart attacks, traffic accidents or other natural causes at random places, at random times. Yet, our psychic genius smells murder. Even if this isn't enough, he starts to investigate who the hell is "murdering" those criminals. I mean, even if those deaths are murders, it might be some organizations doing. It might be a vigilante organization, a corporation that tests illegal drugs on unwanted people, or it might even be the government. But no, thanks to his genius and psychic powers he narrows it down to murder and decides to go after "the dude" murders those criminals. Riiight!!! <br/><br/>After beating the anime's plot senseless, I want to say about a few good things about it. First of all, acting is very good, and the sense of suspense and mystery is very appealing. The animation in this anime is top notch, characters are realistic, and movements are fluid.<br/><br/>If the plot wasn't that flawed, I would have loved this anime. I really, really don't get why people get so exited about this. Its whole point is to have geniusly written plot, its mediocre and high school level at best, like the most of other Japanese animes. It isn't worth more that five stars, just because of acting and perfect animations... Let as an exposition suffice, that I expected, after reading the comments, a somewhat reflexive series -i.e. something that requires thought to get insight out of it- and was extremely disappointed; to be fair not during the whole course of watching the series, but really instantly after the sobering first episodes and anything that followed.<br/><br/>My purpose is not to get into the story details of the series, as those are not its primary flaws, but rather get done with the notion that Death Note is in any way "intellectually stimulating", or such. The conception and nearly any other aspect of it's protagonists characterization is extremely misguided, and the series whole dynamics -by whichever standard you choose to evaluate art by- deeply ignorant. It isn't simply that the whole presentation of the protagonists is immature (though there are many parallels to, for example, flat, heroic depictions in fantasy books) they are throughout strongly misconceived, or rather devoid of conception, only tagged with primitive notions like "genius", "dumb", "girly" etc. This naturally determines the pacing of the series, and it does so in a negative way, especially in the beginning: I of course get, that it was the intention of setting up the premises fast and to develop a character setup that efficiently generates suspense, which led the writers to compactify Light's decision to become the 'god' of his envisioned 'new world'-utopia and hence to murder countless criminals, without considering any evidence but TV-newscasts in the first episode- but exactly this decision already nearly destroyed the possibility of the actions of the main protagonist being believable in any way. And as absurdly it may feel to state the plot as above: that's essentially all there is to know about it.<br/><br/>The exception being the presence of Death Gods, whose powers allow the titular Death Notes to work: but these are a unmotivated, comical construct that rob much of the series credibility, not only because they are Death Gods, and as such rather ridiculous, mythical creatures- but most of all because they are extremely helplessly, and without any interesting explanation, embedded in the story and they individually have no defined personality whatsoever. They further are seldom of importance as plot catalysts (because there were seemingly no ideas about how to include them reasonably) but still are featured the whole time simply because of their function as a necessary story-device and as such constantly introduce (outragouesly arbitrary) 'rules' that shape the possibilities of the Death Notes. The Gods themselves are badly thought-through, badly presented and badly integrated in the story-arc, and therefore their presence often is awkward and irritating.<br/><br/>As the overall story is really hard to take serious, I hoped the characters would at least partially relief this circumstance by being interesting- but this is not the case. Light and L. -which are for a good part of the series the absolute center of the plot- are its gravest flaw. They are at no point characterized and act at (nearly) no point like humans. Both seem to have no interest in anything still mysteriously know and are able to predict everything (for example: neither of them is ever seen reading a book, neither of them has at any point a scientific or philosophic discussion). These demands are primitive I know, and should serve only exemplary: it doesn't suffice to let some character hold a book about string theory and tag him a genius- but L. and Light are worse than that: they simply are geniuses, without having a personality- which is obviously a paradox and makes them seem like obsessed robots bare of any motivation. The central premise, that Light wants to create a world for 'gentle people', isn't addressed in more than a few sentences in the whole series. He doesn't reflect any moral dilemma, or is tormented by it in any way, he doesn't even sense that there may be a contradiction in murdering without regret in order to create a purer world- instead everything the viewer perceives of his thoughts are his childish schemes and ridiculous deductions. L. on the other hand is vaguer still: He has no personality, background or declared motivation except pride, and is only given a few stereotypic trademarks that obtusely symbolize concentration and obsession. The plot dynamics therefore are: will he be caught?, and diverse variations of it- the rest of the series' construct is devoid of any believable aspect. <br/><br/>I didn't mention another important character, Misa. I don't want to spend much time discussing her because she really is a f--king disgrace. Never, I think I have seen -not even in b--lshit Holly-Wood-action fabrications- a character of such sexist design. Her unconditioned love for Light is never explained or analyzed, but merely introduced as another premise which can be used as an artificial story device and includes thereby conveniently the possibility of randomly showing her of in a short negligee. Really; it occurred to me that her character comes closest to a 'babe'(proverbial: as she behaves like a little child) out of some hentai. I cannot belief how anyone can be satisfied by such an ignorantly cpmstrued protagonist. <br/><br/>In spite of this having been only criticism, I give the series four stars: Primarily because it managed at many points to really generate a strong field of suspense and kept me watching -unproportional to its quality- many episodes (though leaving me, besides of wanting to know what will come next, deeply unsatisfied), and furthermore the criticism is at a fairly high level,in comparison to, say: Pokemon. Finally Death Note is anything but a thought-provoking, good series and at best to be called -in terms that aren't too harshly degrading-: harmless, naive, slightly childish. So it really either is misconceived and misshapen or doesn't intend to be thoughtful. It generates an atmosphere of intellect, for those who cannot envision it themselves, i.e. it creates a model of genius that is pleasurable for those who can't see that it's phony. I have to admit that at the beginning I was not sure whether watch it or not, it took me more than a year to encourage myself about taking the decision to have a little time off to watch the entire series, it may sound dramatic to you but that's how it is, during this time, I had read and heard great comments about this anime, a lot people saying how a masterpiece this anime is and so. I have never felt the obligation to follow people's advises or 'recommendations' but there have been times when you have to be honest to agree with people's opinion. Unfortunately this was not the case.<br/><br/>When I finally finished to watch the anime, I felt DISAPPOINTED - yes, in capital letters- disappointed with the end and disappointed with the plot. I do not consider myself as a genius but the plot turns out to be clever and dumb at a time, with unrealistic points on the table. Although I have to admit that the first half is interesting and entertaining, the animation is great and the character designs are awesome. The story is predictable and you easily lose interest in the series after the first half. I won't say it is a waste of time because it is not, but it's not like watching Code Geass either, which keeps you up with the story.<br/><br/>I do not try to offend people that may find this series as a masterpiece but I guess the cleverness on the plot makes it boring at one point (if you are smart enough to understand), maybe Death Note does not have the perfect balance between cleverness and silliness, turning it into a plain story.<br/><br/>I think the '7 out of 10' is perfect for DN! It makes you wonder, what does this life mean, why all the struggle. In the end, we all die, that is it, no doubt about it. I don't watch animes at all. But this is so good and addictive that I can't stop until I know what will happen next. Very well written and brilliant characters. Light's character is witty and sharp. Even if you don't like anime, you will definitely love this. This show/anime is absolutely brilliant. There is seldom a show or movie that can portray a point of view of an anti-hero main character in such a way that you feel justified by his/her actions and yet also feel conflicted by their actions towards achieving what they believe in Absolute Justice.
The pharse that comes to mind is "You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain". I'm going to start off by saying I don't watch animes. I don't like them at all. This one was suggested to me and at the beginning I was quite sceptical. It took me some time to sit down and watch it.<br/><br/>But then, after all this fear, I couldn't put it down. It was so enjoyable, full of suspense. There was no real action, fighting scenes or shooting, but that didn't bother me one bit. Why would have it, when the plot makes up for it. You never know what will happen next. Just when you think 'That's it, he got him' you say 'Wow, another twist'. That is what makes this series stand out for me.<br/><br/>Despite its praises, though, I feel that after L's death the series took a dip. From there on it's too rushed and things don't happen in the manner they used to. Near (or the new L) just realises things to quickly and easily. L, who is clearly a better investigator and character, would never have come to conclusion that easily. Also, the inclusion of Mello is useless, he doesn't add anything particular to the series.<br/><br/>This doesn't take too much away from the series, though, and I would still highly recommend watching it. Great series!!! I Used to love to watch normal movie ...but I thought of Seeing an ANIME for change of mood.
I thought I would be not great , cartoonish .
But when I watched 1 episode of it I was so enganged , the story of the ANIME is so good, then I was hooked to it , watched 2 to 3 episode daily .
The Twist and Turns in the series keep me hooked to it. After the 20 episode the story is just going round and round ..It feels like when it will END..But is not at all Boring. The ending of the Series is quite unexpected and Brilliant. Loved My First ANIME in My life. If you have not seen this show. Watch it. From the ridiculousness and brilliance of L's character to the the insane yet genius calculations of Light this show will make you question society's idea of right and wrong and what it would be like to have the power to make change happen before your very eyes. The show is thought-provoking but if you dislike intellectually oriented shows this may not be for you. Anyway 10/10 would watch again. <br/><br/>P.s. If you liked Code Geass, Monster or Fate/Zero you will enjoy this. Ending was bad<br/><br/>good initial premise but stretched out too long
tedious and cliched characters although notable exception is Light's dad<br/><br/>two 'sherlock' characters battle it out in a game of wits but neither can one up each other for the sake of stretching out the show.<br/><br/>only one real stand out episode. if you've seen the show you would know.
kind of chilling how he comes to accept his fate This anime is perfect in every way. From the first intro song, to the plot, storytelling, tension, character development. Everything. Flawless. A quick summary without spoilers that will not do it justice.... The story follows Light Yagami, a student who one day discovers a journal which primary rule states that any name written inside will result in death of that person. Light initially in disbelief "tests" its power and finds that it does in fact do what it says. Equipped with the journal, Light Yagami becomes the embodiment of what is his view of "justice". If there was ever a time to get into an anime and you have yet to see Death Note, which in my opinion rivals the greatest of greatest anime, its now. The 3 out of ten is because it starts amazing but then goes downhill. In the end it does not work. The story is designed around a set of rules regarding the deathnote notebook but the writers obviously couldn't deal with their own rules and after a few episodes started adding more rules and changing existing rules until I forgot what half of the rules were but even so the story and characters started off amazing. By the time I got to the the episodes in the late teens I was starting to feel it had become silly, disjointed and at times confusing maybe because by this point it had lost my attention. Episode 19 I rewatched 4 times because I was getting bored and kept getting distracted at which point I thought enough is enough and I never watched it again. <br/><br/>I can't deny though the good bits are pure brilliance and exceptionally clever. Such a shame it lost direction. Would I recommend this - yes - but without me giving spoilers I will just say when it starts getting silly call it a day and then watch a good anime like Hunter x Hunter. So, I today started watching this show called "death note" cause it seemed interesting when my friends told me about it. So, I got to the episode 25 and so far, I think will not continue. It could've been much more interesting if the main character wasn't a complete ***hole. I have noticed that writers of the show seem to forget the main character's girlfriend, and when they remember her, she just says something like "Why don't you spend more time with me" and all that kind of sh*t. Many other characters have almost no character development and are quite boring. Then there's some horrible jokes here and there. And story doesn't seem to be going anywhere. <br/><br/>Uh sorry, I shouldn't sh*t on it too much. I'm tired, it's like... what...? 3am. So yeah. (btw first review from a annoying hippie teenager) I read the manga, and now I just finished watching the anime series (next up is live aciton), and I'm quite thrilled.<br/><br/>The plot as a whole is original. The premise of a DeathNote in itself is quite ludicrous of course, but once you get over that you just watch in awe as the most epic cat and mouse game in a long time unfolds before your eyes over 37 episodes. You never quite know where everything is headed. The plot and constant twists always kept me guessing and thus highly entertained. (Not exactly in the anime version because they followed the manga very closely, but still. Watch the anime. I actually would recommend this in this case.) The characters are quite fascinating. While I didn't care much about Misa, even she played her role. But its obviously L and Light that take the crown. Their relationship pretty much carries the series, and it shows when L is suddenly absent.<br/><br/>Light is one of the most scariest, twisted, nihilistic and most of all intelligent bastards in recent creative history and you still root for him. L is pretty much every detective ever and I couldn't really place why I like him but I did. You end up rooting for both sides, and that makes for the fascination in this series.<br/><br/>Truth to tell (and thats why I'm subtracting stars) I didn't that much care for the things happening after L's demise. It was a nice twist, but I never really warmed up to his replacements. Hence I also didn't like the ending. It just seemed like N and especially M didn't deserve to win. Things like they were, I would have much preferred for Light to succeed and the ending to be open.<br/><br/>Still, this was one of the most original series I've seen in a while and is definitely worth a watch. If you're not hooked after three episodes though, it's probably not for you. I am glad to see that despite the average of 9.0 from numerous voters... there are still many people here who can look at this anime series from an objective point of view and openly state its flaws.<br/><br/>No need for me to go into details or spoilers at all. I've seen about every Death Note there is to see (aside from the 2017 American series which I refuse to watch just on principle). Like many here I understand the Death Note concept and found the original move to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>But this anime... it was like packing a 2 hour movie into a 14 hour slow-motion treadmill. As pointed out by several others-- plot concepts were repeated, concepts thrown in and then ignored, and by the 20th episode I was feeling like Ryuk... bored bored bored. Although well-presented, this felt like nothing more than someone trying to drag out the original story lines to as many episodes as they could possibly milk. But the cow ran dry long before the series ended.<br/><br/>Filled with gaping plot holes, lack of logic, areas of ridiculous complexity and jump-the-shark "logic"... this felt like an old Charlie Chan movie mystery where one person says "I have won because" and the other person says "Except I foresaw that and" and then the first person says "But I knew you foresaw it so I" and then the second person... well, you get the idea. Savvy viewers can only handle so much of that stuff before they start thinking "seriously?".<br/><br/>The gore in the very final episode was unprecedented in the series, gratuitous and totally unnecessary to ending the story. There was a strong feeling of anti-climax pretty much through the entire last half of the series (if not before). I started questioning where they were going somewhere after the 10th episode. At the 20th episode I was asking "how long are they going to drag this on?". By the time we got to episode 30 I had given up all hope and watched the rest on sheer "closure" factor-- let's get this watched and over with.<br/><br/>One major mistake in production which I don't understand (probably had something to do with legal rights) was the change in the theme song about halfway through. They went from a barely-tolerable beginning and end song to a total-trash, super-heavy-metal theme song that sounded like it came out of some stoner's garage band. If the purpose of that "music" was to convince us there are insane people in the world... it was a total success. I like just about all kinds of music, but that second theme song was a loser in both concept and performance and did nothing to support the series. It turned Death Note into Dead Note and was a terrible choice for theme music.<br/><br/>One scene especially (no spoilers) where someone was going to murder two people in cold blood to eliminate Kira-- all I can say is the writers must have been smoking weed when they came up with that lame concept. That didn't make any sense from any viewpoint, and certainly was not Death Note. They had a shark jump the shark on that one.<br/><br/>In the end the series was way too long, too contrived in plot, and had too many unbelievable points and logic flaws to stand up to examination. No matter how much someone may have enjoyed the original Death Note movie, if viewed honestly this anime just doesn't stand up to the standards of good anime or the Death Note concept either one. I'm a great fan of the original 2006 movie... but I was yawning 2/3 of the way through this series. The story line was forced and mediocre at best. As I've stated with a couple of other Death Note wannabe's... we don't need yet another Death Note; the original was just fine. This is one of the greatest series that ever created, and very simply there is no words to describe the peace of art in this anime. It's amazingly beautiful, incredibly smart, and very thriller. There is no talk about the animations as drawing and characters, as the Japaneses anime is very known, amusing and attractive. But the story is incredible, i just sit and watched the whole series one time, an episode after the other, because you just can't stop. I'm addicted to movies and series, where smart and intelligent tweaks dominant the story, and this is the case here, the complexity, the smartness, the intelligence and the events are very amazing. I recommend this anime for everyone who's searching for a brain teaser, and who likes brain tweaks and tricks. It really deserves 10. Good luck watching it. Death Note is a masterpiece among thousands of anime. It shines above all, basking in the light of a new world. The plot line is slightly confusing, which is why I gave it a 9/10. I still need to re watch it to refresh my mind, as it has been over seven months since I watched Death Note. However, I remember a twisted main character, an ominous foreshadowing, and an incredibly intense game of cat and mouse. This anime will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. Death Note was the most intense thriller of my entire life, and this diamond in the rough of many other anime is definitely a keeper. For the love of Light Yagami, please watch this! This anime succeeded my expectations! I heard about this anime,but didn't pay attention to it because I thought it was just another anime about demons! It is true it has an supernatural element to it! But for the most part this anime is a thriller! And a very good one! I have seen 21 episodes now (i think there are five left) and the tension only is building up! This anime is full of twists and turns and is very exciting to watch! As the story goes on matters get more complex,more people get involved. But the main reason to watch this show is because of the mind battle between "Light" and "L"! "L" is a special agent in charge of the "Kira" case! "Kira" kills criminals in order to make the world a better place! (The way he does it is a real mystery for the police but not for the viewers because we know kira is using "the death note")! "Light" is "Kira" and knows that "L" is close in capturing him! Of course "Light" wants "L" dead so he can continue his quest! And "L" wants to stop "Kira"! Each time when they get close to their goals they outsmart each other! You don't know what to expect!This is such a thrilling experience! This anime is tense and serious but also manages to throw in some humor to lighten up matters! I am hooked! Go watch this anime immediately!<br/><br/>Seen all 37 episodes (28june2007)! A good ending! But I would have ended the series earlier (after episode 25)! Than the ending would have been more powerful and satisfying! Still it is one hell of an anime! Death Note has been very intelligently written, directed and dubbed. The story moves with great pace without losing any control over the plot. Though the story and concept is complex, it has been elaborated such that there is no scope of confusion.Each of the next episode beats its previous. Kira vs L, the best brains at work, kept my heart pounding like anything.Its like, story has been written over most brilliant game of chess. But during the last two episodes, I could see my heart beat through my shirt as the mystery unraveled. There is no doubt that it is the best TV series I have ever seen(and I have seen many).Watch it because serial like Death Note is not created every year. The first half of this show is a 10/10 masterpiece, no spoilers here, but after a certain point the show just goes downhill. The second half introduces some new characters that are annoying and intolerable, and maybe it's just me but I feel like the quality of the writing kind of goes downhill too. Honestly, if the show ended at episode 25 then it would've been perfect, but nope instead it kept going and got worse and worse and worse. Luckily the actual ending itself was really satisfying though. This is one of the best anime for people who have just started watching anime. It is a very good series that show what this medium of entertainment can achieve. to this day anime lover still quote light yagami and are in love with L. The show is fantastic, episodes 1-25 are the best, after that the show kind of takes a nosedive, I would still highly recommend the show I mean, really. Two death gods fall in love with her (not to mention one is a girl), Matsuda idolizes her, Light's sister loves her, and everyone else acts as if there isn't a little pest buzzing around the room. Honestly, how can you not make her want to shut up? I hated her 30 seconds after she first showed up. She's not even necessary to the story, to be perfectly honest, and it would probably be 10 times better without her. But still, L dies because of a shinigami's misguided love for her. <br/><br/>And then they try to replace him with children, one of which is an obvious ripoff of L himself (dark circles under the eyes, crouching position, black eyes, calm demeanor, etc.). And they don't even offer something like a clever he's-still-a-genius-because-he- planned-his-death solution, which would have made sense considering how smart he's supposed to be. The authors also made L's death out to be unimportant. No one grieves for him or gives him a funeral. Everyone's just like, "L's dead, we need a replacement." Instead they just killed him off and pretended that nothing major just happened. It's worth watching series you will love it but after 26 episode other are slow and not interesting and i think it's because of L ? maybe because first we all want that character dead and then after he died the show died as well . One of the most interresting animes i have seen in my life, all about mind games and simply clever scenes! Light, a Japanese high school student, finds a so-called Death Note, that enables the user to kill people by writing their names in it. He sets about cleansing the world of evil, while the police try to determine who he is... and stop him. This is the first animÃ© series I watch, so I can't draw comparisons to others. It gets extremely visual at times, but at least half of the time, it isn't, particularly. The focus is on the writing, the twists, the mind games. There is a lot of cat-and-mouse going on, and we follow the investigation. Thankfully, both the law enforcement and our young lead are rather smart, so it is a very even match, and quite interesting to follow. In fact, at its best, this keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you'll find yourself watching multiple episodes in a row. At least until about the halfway point, after when it, at times, seems to not particularly move forward(and it suddenly decides to follow something that hasn't been brought up at all prior to that point, and sometimes soon after stops doing so). There are a few plot threads that go nowhere, or that could have been removed to tighten this up. The characters vary... L is awesome, definitely. We do have some that are clearly mainly comic relief, and yes, this does have a little of the silly humor that can be found in a lot of mainstream manga. The animation is nicely done, with some stunning moments and impeccable style. There is brutal, bloody, violent content in this. I recommend it to those who like the concept and want to see it explored, or anyone who enjoys this kind of detective thriller. 8/10 Im a big anime fan, So I've seen many many series.However, I can honestly say, this is the best of the best.Death Note is creative and well thought out. While there are a few moments during the show where things could have been changed slightly, but overall, Its near perfect. During its 37 episode lifespan it throws enough twists and cliff hangers to keep you going and wanting more.It may not appeal to some people.But if you begin to watch this I can guarantee if you at this show you will be thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>Death Note<br/><br/>9/10 stars This is a super-difficult anime series to describe--especially to those who are not anime lovers. This is because the plot is so totally bizarre and complex, but I'll take a stab at it: I death god ("Ryuk") is bored, so he drops a death notebook randomly to see what occurs when a mortal finds it. A brilliant high school student, Light, finds it and soon realizes that if he writes a person's name in it and concentrates on the face of that person, then they will die! At first, Light uses this notebook to kill off the evil scum of the world and he becomes a pop hero--though no one knows who is doing these murders or how they are done. Eventually, the police decide that murdering these scum is bad and try to put a stop to it (why, I don't know--he is performing a community service).<br/><br/>At this point, most viewers will likely side with Light and the story isn't all that compelling. However, the writing is brilliant, as Light slowly transforms from a well-meaning young man to someone with a god complex--and a person willing to kill ANYONE--whether they deserve it or not. The anime really has a lot to say about the notion of power corrupting, though I would sure be willing to use a death notebook to see if I would be corrupted (look out DMV workers with an attitude and trial lawyers, here I come!).<br/><br/>As is typical of any anime, the original manga is slightly different and the live-action movie is even more different yet. I advise you to give the series a try or watch the first movie (which is even better). Even if you are not a huge anime fan (and I am NOT), you'll enjoy it if you are willing to give it a try with an open mind. *Beginning & L saga was superv, fantastic.
*32-37 episodes Good( ending was 8/10)
*Middle parts are mixture of 'okey' & 'Meh'. It is extremely well written plot! Something that you must watch if you like crime drama! Ok this is my first anime series and I loved first half then it gets worst sorry This anime is too good but i wish it lasted longer it couldve been even better but this is a masterpiece. Death note is a show that twists everything up and comes out amazing. The protagonist isn't a hero and most of his actions are interpreted as downright villainous, but that adds to it. His interactions with L are almost sherlock-esque and the plot, visuals, music, and all are splendid. This anime came out perfect and while the second part is a bit worse it couldn't take a star away. Definitely the best anime I have ever seen. The storyline, metaphors, character development, drawings, music everything is perfect. Finished the whole series in two days. The ending is nothing less than expected but frankly it broke my heart. I root for Light because, he is courageous to change the world risking his life and in my opinion the smartest of all, always finds a way to trick opponents, on the other hand, I hate him for hurting Misa and some other innocent characters. To me, death note is magnus opus of the anime kingdom. Death note was the first anime i ever watched, and is my favorite one. amazing. although the ending made me sad, the show was a masterpiece I am not an anime lover. But this show omg it was amasing probebly one of the best shows in the world "Follow the teachings of god
then the blessings of the sea will be bountiful
and there will be no storms"<br/><br/>Those are the words that we first hear from Yagami Light, the main character of this show. And in many cases, this represents that we are about to watch. A god who will bless those who follow his teachings, and strike a storm on those who don't.<br/><br/>
Death note is a show about Yagami Light who finds a notebook on the school grounds. Someone must have dropped it. This catches Light's attention. So after class, Light checks the same place to see if the notebook is gone, which it isn't. He takes the notebook and reads the next on it, which says that "The human whose name is written in this note shall die".
Light drops the note and walks away thinking that it's a sick joke, but something makes him take it home anyway.
He decides to try it out, and it works. Light has found a way to kill anyone. He has become a god.<br/><br/>And if I had to describe the show in one sentence, it would be that Light tries to become a god. With the accompanying sacral score and dramatic animation, we see how Light's mind works. How his god complex is affecting him.<br/><br/>But even though Light is the character that makes everything work IMO, it is L who makes it all stick.
L is the "detective" character who is introduced as the contrast to Light. He is very unpredictable, quirky and calm. But even though they're personalities are different, they're "intellectual levels" aren't. L is the only one in Lights way. And that is what makes L's character work so well. Even when similar characters are introduced in the last third, they could never compete with L.<br/><br/>This is both a problem and a blessing.
Cause L works best when Kira is active. Both of them work the best when both are active (BTW, this doesn't really have anything to do with the story. Just my opinion on the characters). And so when one of them isn't, my enjoyment suddenly changed. And if you have seen the show (Which I hope you have), you know why I bring this up. Cause when a little more than a third of the show has gone, Light isn't Kira anymore. He gives up his role as the killer. This made his character a lot less interesting IMO, and therefore L's too. And when that arc has finished, L dies too.<br/><br/>So as you can see, I wasn't nearly as big of a fan of the second half than the first one. It wasn't bad. But if one of them were gone, then the show lost what made it special in my opinion.<br/><br/>But again, I really liked this show. I'll give the show a 9/10. I know a lot of you will disagree, but I couldn't ignore my lack of enjoyment during the parts where one of Kira and L was gone. This anime was one of the first ones that I watched, And I totally enjoyed it I recommend to Death Note was a stellar TV Show and on its way to being one of my favorite animated TV Shows. With its incredible concept, interesting villainous protagonists and an antithesis to the protagonist that complimented his genius perfectly. The formula was great with the exception of episodes 18-22 which features our protagonists cunning on a boring way that leads to a lackluster payoff. After this however. Episodes 23, 24 and 25 are phenomenal works of art. This is where the series goes from Incredible to incredibly mediocre. With the exception of the last 3 episodes of the show, there is no right for any of the episodes after episode 25 to exist. The show went from having me completely invested to it feeling like a chore to finish, which is a shame because of how great the last 3 episodes actually were. They introduce new antagonists that are literally the exact same thing as the last one we had, except much worse and no fun at all to watch. I was frustrated with these new characters and their placement in the show. In my opinion Death Note should have ended at episode 25 then it would have been a nearly perfect anime. Known as the masterpiece of the animation "death note", this is a type of intelligent and suspenseful animation, there is no large-scale bloody violence scene, but in the plot and the core is extremely powerful. "Death note" is very powerful. It shows you a duality of justice and a deep discussion of human nature. In fact, human nature will have desire. When the night God moon wrote down his name for the first time after he got the death note, he was doomed to be unable to stop. For example, in reality, if you can have a notebook that can realize your wishes instinctively, when you write down the first wish in the notebook, can you really stop? If it's me, I can't say I can. This anime is unrivalled by any other. The story line is great and the course of anime is top. No one will regret watching this anime. And the music is also great. Death Note is my first anime I've ever watched. This show is chock full of double crosses, bluffs, fakes, and tons of guesses. These characters act very intelligently, always considering what their enemies might be up to. This works most of the time, but I think there are some episodes (especially in the second half) where this causes the plot to get overly complicated. The finale was really great except how did Near get the real death note?<br/><br/>I think the show should have ended at episode 25 with L's death. The rest of Death Note was still very good, but it gets way too complicated once Near and Mello are introduced. L and Light's rivalry and eventual friendship was phenomenal. I don't think we really got that with Light pitted against Near.<br/><br/>If this show was a little slower paced, ended with episode 25, and wasn't extremely complicated, then I'd give it a 10/10. But those issues move it down to the 9/10. At least we had Matsuda for comic relief amongst the chaos. From Dororo, to Sword Art Online, to Overlord, to Cautious Hero, and finally The Seven Deadly Sins, I thought it was clear to me how anime goes... but after watching Death Note, I could never be more stoked. Clearly, it has a much different way of capturing the attention of the viewer.
By making one think harder, and yet, "concerned" for the sake of the success of - what could be expected to perhaps be - "the wrong side", the edge of the seat could never be closer.<br/><br/>The rush that comes by thinking of "what to do next" is simply unparalleled by any show or movie I've ever watched. The vitality and complexity of decision making is just beautifully portrayed. And all by heightening and exploring the vulnerability that comes with mortality. In my opinion, this show goes beyond just anime.<br/><br/>By revealing the blur between what is thought to be "good" and "bad", it shows just how possible it is for black and white to be one and the same, all by their capability of being grey. Just remarkable. I can't think of anything I've ever watched (including anime) that explores the concept of "change" as well as this show right here... that had 1 perfect season. Couldn't have done it better. Amazing show. I can simply say that this anime is the closest I have seen to perfection. Unfortunately Death Note can't hold up to its standards in the last few episodes which felt rushed and not executed properly. Could have been perfect it's really close to perfection but I guess nothing is perfect? To everyone reading this, just stop right there and START WATCHING THIS SERIES.<br/><br/>If you made it this far to read this review, I've got a bad news for you, you are wasting to your time since you haven't started watching this. Anyway, you may need a bit more specifications why should you watch. I won't be going for spoilers, just few things I needed to add, doesn't matter whether you are old or in your 20's, this is something you would want to watch. It has got excitement, a bit of romance and a whole lot of thrill. I started watching anime with this one. The story is really good. Weather you're new to anime or an anime fan this series is for you
I have watched it three times until now and i discover more things the more i go back into it.<br/><br/>I would really recommend you watching this especially for the ones that hate anime
Cause it will blow your mind.. I loved every second of this show. Not one second was the show boring. The animation of this show was good. They did a good job on the plot of this story. This was the first crime/ action anime I finished. I loved how the story turned out. The hats tee development was nice. I liked the fact that the police son was the person killing everyone using the death note book but yet the police and everyone didn't know it or want to believe it for most of the series. L was my fav character hands down even know everyone else was good too. Something about L made him so good. I when I first saw L from the way he looked I thought he would have been the person using the notebook killing anyone but he wasn't. It turned out that he was on the good side and was working with the police. At first I thought the police son was gonna be good but it turns out he had the notebook and was using it to kill anyone and was getting more and more power hungry as time when on. I like how L was on the good side working with the police instead of the son it made the story so much better then it would have been if the son was on the good side working with the police instead of fooling them like he was in the anime. I loved the fanstay/ magical creature that we're suppose to be caring for the death notes books so they didn't get in the hands of someone that would use it for bad. I like how they were designed. All of the other character designs where good too. I liked the colors they choose for this anime to be in. It had lots of action. I liked how the anime had darker colors in it. I would recommend this anime to everyone. The best anime of all time but the ending was bad
But it's good Are you kidding me? An 8.9? Really? Okay, lemme just break this down from the experience that I had. It starts out with lots of dark colors and a generally gray atmosphere that gave me headaches from the blandness. But that's a stylistic choice I won't focus on. There was character dev in the first episode, and that was it. Light when from boring student to serial killer in like 15 minutes. And then it's just him Ocean's 11-ing schemes to kill people without the antagonists finding out. Well, until an 8 year old boy joins the crew. So Light talks to Ryuk a very small amount of time then he just became a background character. Light is a generally unlikable guy with a flat personality that he held true till the end. L was probably diabetic by the end. And the finale finished up just how I would expect from the person that created the series. A big "f**k you" to any fans by killing of the guy that most of the -angsty girls that touched themselves to his image- fans liked. The animation and drawing style are what's to be expected from a big budget anime, the dubs are acceptable, and any technical aspects were fine. In the end though, I personally watch something for an experience. I want to feel emotion about the media in some way, and I just didn't have that. I found a completely overrated and boring story about a kid that wants to kill people and is aided by a death god. What seemed possibly exciting became boring as it went from psycho-drama-adventure to cop drama. tl;dr boring The plot of Death Note is unbelievable and childish. A notebook that kills? the premise is so far-fetched that you are never fully into the drama. It could have been much better if it was a more human murderer.<br/><br/>The main character is a fascist by all standards, although we know he is evil we are driven to sympathize with his views. It wouldn't be surprising that the majority of fans of this are selfish and overly-shy teenagers, who think that they have the right to impart justice without understanding or compassion, only because they feel so superior.<br/><br/>-- SPOILER -- Although it starts and ends dramatically, there are very poor episodes towards the middle specially after the best character makes his/her unexpected final exit. I have to admit that this anime hooks you from the very first episodes and it is most definitely interesting to watch to the very end (maybe except a few episodes). However, the more you think about it the more ridiculous it gets. Characters are pretty typical for an anime (even if the main character is a bad guy, he's still a typical anime bad guy)... a bunch of weirdos for fan-girls to feast on.<br/><br/>The more I think over the plot the less sense it makes. A lot of things simply seem unnecessary and unreasonable. Actually, it's hard to find anything that makes sense in this show and some parts simply seem funny.<br/><br/>Basically, it is interesting to watch but I'd suggest doing it only once otherwise you might start hating it. Death Note is a pretty good anime. I am pretty picky about my reviews (so that even above 6 is a rarity since it is hard to find something good. Just look at Sturgeon's Law), however I must say that there is a ton of good in the beginning. This anime had alright characters (not much character development), good music, good animation, and some of the most clever plots and plans I have seen in anime. However, I must note that while it had some great features, this was in the first half before L died. If it had ended there, it would have been a masterpiece. However, after L's death the show became quite boring. The show had a deus ex writing moment when it is revealed that L had a timer to tell everyone in Watari's orphanage that he was dead. The once clever plots became boring, and the new characters were bland and boring. And the ending? Oh god, the ending. This was especially disappointing since the first half was so good that if this half did not exist I would have perhaps given this show a perfect score. Otherwise, Death Note was a fairly well done show that could have been a masterpiece had it known when to end and not show off its flaws. Let me begin this by saying there are hardly, if any, things that can be described as 'bad' in Death Note. This anime is just absolutely amazing in every possible way. When I first heard about Death Note a few years ago I was not appealed at all and had no intention to watch it, but then last year I was searching for a series to watch after finishing Dexter and I stumbled across this again. I'll be honest when I say I wasn't sold on the first episode as I found it very sudden and it seemed too rushed. How wrong was I? By the sixth episode I was absolutely engrossed. With the short but sweet 22 minute runtime per episode, the show left me wanting more without letting it drag with irrelevant segments. The entire series is only a brief 37 episodes but it doesn't give some draggy backs-story, it cuts straight to the action. After breaking through the shows somewhat intense opening episode, I managed to watch the entire series in less than two weeks.<br/><br/>The characters are amazingly developed with an unusually unique protagonist and other characters with flaws, they give the show a realistic feel and let the audience connect emotionally. The story is probably the most unique story I've ever come across. It packs a punch with its darkly twisted story interlinked with a lightening touch of comedy and jaw dropping plot twists to make the audience completely unsuspecting of the plot's next turn. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Death Note is amazing, even if you don't like anime, I highly recommend that you watch this as you will rarely ever find another masterpiece like this. I may seem a bit biased with this review but believe me, it's for your own good! Death note is about a genius high school student Light Yagami who one day finds a note book on the ground. Instructions in the note book say that you can kill anyone by simply writing their name and picturing their face in the note book. Light is stunned that it actually works and decides to create a world without evil by terminating all the hardcore criminals in the world however worlds greatest detective only known as L gets closer and closer to the truth of all these killings.<br/><br/>There only a handful of series who get my 9/10 vote, but Death note deserves it, the thrilling and intellectual cat and mouse game between Light and L is brilliantly played out yet simple to follow after the 3rd episode your eyes will be glued to the screen by the breath taking story, which is a accomplishment by itself without much real action. Anime fan, or not, 80 or 16 years old I would strongly recommend watching one of the best series of all time, Death note 9/10 Death note is one of the best anime series I have ever seen. L is the greatest detective and Light is very evil, Misa is quite dumb and Ryuk just wants to eat apples -.-<br/><br/>L vs Kira was amazing. After L dies the show was not that good. Near tried to be L but wasn't anywhere near him<br/><br/>The 2nd episode of the series is epic. Light will do anything and use anybody to achieve his goal. He is the Walter White of this show.<br/><br/>The beginning episodes were nicely written but in the last few episodes they were just dragging it. Overall I was glad that I watched an amazing show which could have been mind-blowing. If you are new to the whole genre of anime (as I am) you should probably watch 'Death Note' just due to the relative popularity of this title. <br/><br/>It turns out to be a curious examination of the concept of justice through a teenager / young adult's eyes. The setting laid out in the beginning of the series with a bored-to-death shinigami, a god of death, deciding to amuse himself by venturing to the human world is rather non-trivial, although his own story is quickly sidelined and, unfortunately, not explored in any detail. <br/><br/>The plot develops with the introduction of some well-written characters, like the protagonist Light Yagami and his antipode L, as well as the skillfully devised twists to keep the viewers engaged and eager to watch the next episode. With the Misa storyline, however, it all goes a different direction and when the Higuchi narrative comes into play, the whole show simply starts to drag.<br/><br/>I would also hope that the original dialogue is more sophisticated than the English-dubbed version, which at times seemed painfully simplified, childish and, by and large, too westernised. <br/><br/>So, since it was just about 11 episodes that I could watch without feeling like the series was losing its potential, after the fact I would give 'Death Note' a pass... But who knows, maybe it is just because I didn't like the over-the-top predictable ending and let this cloud my judgement. This anime can be wrapped up kinda quick (Warning.. kinda spoilersish) Okay so the beginning started out with a first episode that I can only compare as, perhaps, almost as powerfully grabbing as breaking bad. Seriously it was great, then it followed up strong and kept it going good until it starts to make you wonder how there going to keep it going around half way. Then...<br/><br/>WHAT THE !@#$ DID THEY DO TO THIS MASTERPIECE, they start off by killing off THE WRONG !@#&@#&#&ING GUY... :*( WHY HIM SERIOUSLY (If you watch it.. you will know who I mean), then they throw in some stupid generic anime twists to a already convoluted plot line. NOW to top it all off, three new terrible antagonists step in and eventually it all winds down to a very anti climatic ending.<br/><br/>It's kinda funny, you can see it happening a million miles away, despite the convoluted pile of crap leading up to it, yet you watch it to the end... Sort of like if you could only look as your life's savings got slowly poured through a wood chipper..<br/><br/>Really... sad... I hope the manga is better, still gets 7 out of 10 for the first half though. I am really concerned and confused by the decisions of shinigamis and as well the reasoning of Near and Mello in the mid of the series?! Dull, dumb and empty dialogs in the 3rd part, like the writers wanted to overcomplicate the story with unanswered questions and unspoken thoughts ? Just a pure unnecessary confusion! Plot holes? 95% of viewers just didn't notice at all, so many illogical and skipped explanations and reasons for some actions of characters. The rules that were made from the very beginning were just forgotten later like they never existed. Watched show many times, and the same questions remained.<br/><br/>First 20 episodes were pure state of art, 10/10, later it went so low This is the first manga-anime conversion I have seen and it has made me very restless to watch other anime shows. Now speaking about the series, it is the exhibition of great minds who have done great work to write this brilliant,suspenseful and ever so interesting story.It is so tempting that you will want to watch episode after episode.Music is just so melodious that at sometimes I got more concentrated on music rather than the story.Here,much cannot be said about acting as its animeðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†. This is one of the series after watching which you will surely love all the characters,you will also feel sad when the series comes to end.Please watch even you haven't seen any anime or you don't like anime this will sure make you watch more anime. Its a must watch show before dying. Deathnote's reputation as an excellent anime is well-earned in my eyes and it was a pleasure to watch. However, it is not without flaws and while I would strongly encourage any anime fans to watch it, I would also never recommend this to someone who didn't already have an interest in anime.<br/><br/>The series greatest strength lies in taking the relatively simple premise of the deathnote and building complex and highly engaging characters around it. The challenges and interactions between these characters is the singular driving point of the series, and what keeps the viewer engaged.<br/><br/>Kira and his continuous battles with his pursuers, most notably L, are fascinating to watch and well executed in concept and form. The visual animation is excellent and the production values, scripting, and voice work (in both Japanese and English) are very well done. I also noticed that the music for the last 7 episodes was especially perfect. The major plot twist at the end of the second act of the series is absolutely stunning and there have been few times I've felt so engaged in what I was watching.<br/><br/>Despite these winning combinations, I did find some faults with the series. First and foremost is that the final act failed to live up to the second. I found many of the key actions of the characters lacking in previous brilliance. Yet an ultimately satisfying conclusion is still there.<br/><br/>Secondly, the series can seem a little too long at times. While I don't think it could be fit into the usual 25 episode anime format without losing some of its quality, I did feel that there were at least 5-6 episodes that could have been cut out for being ultimately inconsequential.<br/><br/>My third and final criticism is more about my personal preference. I found that it held on far too strongly to the conventions typically associated with Japanese-animated film. Deathnote lost some of its potential by making use of several overt stereotypes, most notably the highly annoying character of Misa Misa who seems to exist only to provide fan service, and the far-too-perfect Chief Yagami who's every comment is both unneeded and boring. In addition, the over elaborate settings, resources, and quirks the characters are provided with are somewhat over-the-top.<br/><br/>The core focus of deathnote remains the brilliant game of cat-and-mouse between Kira and his pursuers, but the fact that it is framed within the overly-conventional aspects of anime means it lost both its accessibility and some of its potential to be truly unique. I'm aware that the series is extremely faithful to its source material and thus don't see this as any fault of the series creators. Yet this is why I consider more accessible/nonconformist works such as Watanabe's Champloo and Bebop to be slightly superior to Deathnote, and certainly a better introduction to anime for new-comers.<br/><br/>Despite my complaints, the pros far outweigh the cons and I'd like to reiterate that this is an exceptional series that should be watched by anyone who claims to be an anime fan. Look no further than the jaw dropping anime series that is Death Note.This show is a supernatural psychological thriller that pulls no punches and is not for the faint of heart.Forget those anime shows full of filler, too many characters to count etc,this show was out to tell a dark and morally inept story and succeeded in doing so.The constant battle of wits between the two main characters is literally mind-blowing and the plot is consistently fast- paced,introducing you to new characters who are vital to the endgame.The voice-acting is powerful and passionate in both the dub and sub version and I cannot compliment this show enough.It is unarguably the greatest anime of all time as well as one of the greatest TV shows ever.10/10. Yagami light son of top police officer gets a notebook which has got power to kill anybody whose name is written in it.He uses it to kill criminals.He also learns that he can control the action of persons whom he is killing. The other main character is L. He is very intelligent and has helped police many times to capture criminals.It becomes a contest of wits between the two. Other central character are shinigamis or the dead lords to whom the death note actually belongs.The serial is send into a frenzy when another person gets a death note. Now L and light join force temporarily to fight the new menace. But both do it to Altai different goals. yagami calls himself KIRA. Then he finds that the 2nd KIRA is a girl who has fallen in love with him. Yagami uses it for his benefit while L keeps on matching wits with him while the viewer is awed by there contest. Instead of relying on cutting-edge CG or action sequences, Death Note provides the viewer with top notch story telling and a rich cast of involving characters.<br/><br/>Death Note also offers viewers a chance to see things from the other side of the fence. Where the hero of the story would actually be considered the villain. (No I didn't ruin anything for you because you should figure this out in the first episode) Light Yagami is your typical boy-genius: bored, stuck-up, cynical, and selfish; but when he starts to use the Death Note for his own personal gain you actually start to cheer for him.<br/><br/>Death Note not only gives you a charismatic anti-hero, but it also gives you a great cast of secondary characters that you begin to cherish. From Light's ambiguous shinigami partner to his intellectual equal and rival "L". Death Note offers you an unforgettable ride that will have you cheering for the bad guy. The central premise of Death Note is one that, to say the least, left me rather sceptical, the whole idea seeming like something dreamt up for someone's high school creative writing homework.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long, though, to realise the error of such a judgement. The skill and precision with which the story unfolds is rather breathtaking - the central battle of wits between Light Yagami and his nemesis 'L' must surely rank amongst the subtlest ever laid out on screen, yet the pace never seems to drop for a moment. A mere self-introduction has surely never been as electric in any other story as 'L's is to Light here...<br/><br/>Much of the success of the story can be put down to the brilliant characterisation of these two protagonists, engaged in a life-or-death struggle that essentially boils down to a difference in moral opinion - each considering himself a bastion of justice. It's a story that's been done many times over, sure, but it's kept fresh here by the particularities of the set-up. Indeed, Death Note is a story where everything comes down to the minutest of details, where one simple slip-up could mean total failure or death.<br/><br/>The supporting characters work exceedingly well too; the Shinigami (Death God) Ryuk in particular, playing the role of the voyeur, providing some blackly comic moments of respite from the ever-present tension. Amane Misa is, perhaps, a little grating at times, but even she eventually charms.<br/><br/>If there's anything to criticise in Death Note, it would probably be the slightly disjointed final act. The events at the end of the second act are understandable from a storytelling perspective, and a very bold move in terms of writing. From then on, however, it somehow fails to quite measure up to what has come before. A shame, really, but it doesn't do much to dampen the brilliance of a quite extraordinarily entertaining story. Highly recommended for fans of quality anime. Or, indeed, anyone. I believe that every favorable review for this title is coming from persons who watched the show only until 25th episode, because there is absolutely no chance this show would get so good reviews based on all episodes, since the ones from episode 25 are just... blah... (sigh)
So here's is my opinion, an opinion coming from a guy who watched the entire series and reviews it as a whole. An my verdict is simple: This is the most inconsistent show ever put to screen. The first 11 episodes are awesome with some of the greatest moments ever put to the smaller screen, then comes around 15th till 17th episode some great moments, and then from there the show lost it's tempo and never recovered it. Then aside from 23th, 24th, 25th, 29th and 32th episode the rest is just generic anime that compared to those great episodes seems like garbage.
I don't understand how many people consider this as one of the best anime since it has some huge problems, especially about character and story.
The Character: Light Yagami is very one-sided character from the beginning. I remember when he found the death note he acts as he has an inside turmoil about keeping the death note or not, seeming as if he knows what the death note is from the moment he first saw it. It seemed so in your face along with countless other moments throughout the show where I was like: "Why is that happening? What's the reason/logic?". Next, his motivation has no background. He wants to bring justice because he is bored? Is that really a motivation? Usually a human being wants to bring justice because events that either shaped his life or someone who he cares about. Here? Nothing... absolutely nothing. More, he wants to become god of the new world... again why?... don't know... the same reason most of the Hollywood villains want to do bad things and that's because they want and maybe can. The show even went so far as to give "L" background before his death and give background and motivation to the fourth "Kira" instead of Light who was THE MAIN CHARACTER and the one we should understand and feel for... but nah... there is room for filler and other nonsensical stuff.
Story: The story is interesting only in the episodes I mentioned above... the rest is just filler due to the fact that the show introduces characters and situations that are just not interesting and at one point repetitive. The story was interesting until the 25th episode with a few exceptions because there were so many drastic things that happened that made you think "what more can happen now that can be better than this?" well the show up until a point improved upon every previous great moment. But from the 25th the story became a rehash of the first 25 episodes but faster and more ridiculous. The death of "L" was the most bold thing this show did and maybe any other show did. But they should have continued it with something different not the same with different characters that were just boring. For example at the beginning of episode 26 we see a video that is pretty much a compilation of all the proves "L" got all along the case. I expected that to be a background plan of "L" to make the other people in the task force doubt Light(since he was a suspect and even imprisoned at one point) and bring him down in the end. What did the show did? The same thing it did before episode 25: bring another "L" called "Near" that was just way too over powering that eventually brought Light down, who after episode 25 got dumber and dumber eventually reaching the lows of childish behavior somewhere around the end of episode 36 and 37. All these scream inconsistency which is a problem that many TV shows have, and honestly I would rather prefer a medium TV show like "Person of Interest" that had clever writing and action that improved each season and showed that the writers had ideas, rather than watch a show that has some great moments followed by stupid filler and repetitive stuff.
In conclusion, this is another overrated TV show that just wasted my time overall, even if it had some of the greatest moments in TV history those were unfortunately followed by repetitive and stupid stories. 7/10 from me. Life is quiet boring sometimes. And that's not onLy true for humans, but also for Shinigamis (japoneses gods of Death). But when a shinigami gets bored, the consequences couLd be dramatic for the world. And that's the story this anime chooses to tell.<br/><br/>Ryuku, one of those Shinegami, decides to drop one of his Death note to earth, in order to watch the interesting consequences of his act. This death note has the power to kiLL everyone as soon a the name of a person is written in it. And the young boy who found it has decided to kill plenty : he wants earth to be a paradise, where every criminaLs are erase from its surface thanks to the power of the death note, and to become the god of this new utopia. But things won't be so easy for Yagami Light aka Kira : if he wants to kill someone, he has to have his exact name and to visuaLize his face, and InterpoL, aware of this experience, send a genius detective to stop him, mysteriously named "L".<br/><br/>The most interesting part of this complex and inventive anime Lies in the confrontation between Kira (the owner of the Death Note) and L, that takes the appearance of a deadly chess game, where a single mistake Leeds to failure and death. The first 18 episodes are a mentaL masterpiece, scenaristicaLy very impressive and visually extremeLy convincing. If the rest of the anime is a LittLe less good, the conclusion is also quite surprising and really beautiful.<br/><br/>As Ryuku, that symboLizes the spectator point of view in the show finally said : "It was very pleasant to kill time with this game for so Long. That was really amusing". I have reached episode 28. And it gets more exciting and interesting after each episode. I always think of watching max 2 episodes but end up watching at least 5 :) Must watch series.... I like all the characters and they do justice to their role. I am watching English dubbed version. Also, the theme song is nice and catchy but the 2nd song is not that good. I recommend this series to everyone who is interested in mystery and thriller. I also like the intelligence that the main cop and the main lead has. Both are equally intelligent. Also the female lead is cute. The concept of Shini Gami is nicely put and it makes you wonder if its actually true. Out of the many anime that i've watched till today (including Code Geass) this one tops the list.<br/><br/>you will find reviews which say that the second half of the show is not good, but that is just half the truth.first off the show starts off brilliantly awesome. i can bet you ,if you like thrillers, just watch the first 2 episodes and you will be forced to just go on watching it. the first half continues to be amazing and the show just gets better and better and better.....<br/><br/>now when i say that first half is simply awesome, it doesn't mean that the second half is BAD. the truth is that the first half is just so consistently mind-blowing. there comes a huge plot twist after the first half , and you think -"can the show go on with the plot twist". well it doesn't . but the plot twists again and we're back to where we were.but we land up with another(even major) plot twist) and show loses its charm a little.new characters are introduced and by the time you get used to those new characters,the show ends.but the ending emerges as ,lets say, as good as the beginning.<br/><br/>so it is only fair to say that the second half is irregular (and not bad).one more thing -YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THE AWSOMENESS OF THE FIRST HALF.it is far more mind blowing than anything you can imagine.<br/><br/>Conclusion-go for it you'll be thrilled for the first half, might be off for 5-8 episode , but in the end you might as well want start watching the show again. Like many, I first watched Death Note on Adult Swim many years ago. Back when I felt rebellious sitting in a dark room until 1:00 A.M. And nothing was more fitting than Death Note. Dark, borderline controversial, smart, and page-turning, its probably one-of-a-kind.<br/><br/>After half a decade, I decided to watch it again. I wanted to see how it held up. For the most part, I still think its one of the best animes of the 00s. Its fascinating and suspenseful to see the characters set up their elaborate plans, only to be countered by those a step ahead of them, or with even smarter ideas. Most of the characters are realistic and likable. Even Light, by all means a selfish man, has ambition and charisma. Writing-wise, its excellent. Even when little action is in an episode, I couldn't help but see the next one.<br/><br/>However...two problems stuck out to me this time around. I still think Death Note is great...but I lowered my score because of them, and I can understand if they're deal breakers.<br/><br/>The first big problem is the post-L episodes. Going in, I had no idea why they got so much hate. I figured it was due to whiny Light/L fans. But now I realize how bad Mello and Near really are. Mello has surprisingly little presence for a main character. When he dies, you don't think of him as a misunderstood genius, but an impulsive idiot. Even when his role is revealed, I still didn't like or respect him. Near is even worse! He's basically L without any moments of personality and Gary Stu levels of intelligence. Light and L were unnaturally smart, but Near is just unbeatable. He's never stumped, nor wrong about his assumptions. L didn't need to survive to the end, but his successors show that not even Death Note's writing is perfect.<br/><br/>I should note that I still found the second season very exciting, despite the imperfection.<br/><br/>I've never seen the next problem get brought up before, which I find kinda distressing. Throughout the show, you are forced to wonder if Light's actions are morally right. We get a good idea of his philosophy - the truly evil do not deserve to live, and their deaths only benefit society. Regardless of what you think about it, its an actual, human belief. As for the humanistic side? L, Near, and the task force are all complete i-d-i-o-t-s. It is rare for their arguments to go beyond "Murder is wrong, yo." Yet few questions are asked when they... A. Consistently violate others' right to privacy B. Use death row inmates as pawns C. Even encourage the death penalty (L says so at the end of episode 2). Evil is evil, no matter the intended purpose...unless they do it? Its hypocrisy, but its barely brought up, so it just seems like bad writing. No wonder why so many Death Note fans have become pro-vigilante justice. You and I could make a better case against Light.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I no longer call Death Note a "masterpiece". But its still very good. I don't hand out 8s often. I'm glad I watched it, and for the early impressions it gave. *May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>The main character in Death Note, Yagami Light, is a very intelligent high school student that discovers a notebook that allows him to kill anyone if he knows both their face and name. The notebook has other rules that are discovered later as Yagami Light learns how to use the book and continuously evolves into a maniacal anti hero. He is challenged by a detective that I personally think is better than Sherlock Holmes. They face off against each other in an intellectual battle that is thrilling and exciting. The writer's decision to allow us to hear their thoughts at times enhances the experience as we understand the way their minds work. They weigh possibilities like rational characters and remain diplomatic with less important characters. They don't tell everyone their motives when it is necessary to keep ti a secret and they never stop being intelligent even for a second. If they make mistakes, they are usually do to lack of information at the time. With this said, the show isn't perfect, but it is as close as I have seen. The second half of the show isn't as strong as the first, but the new characters prove that they are unique and worthy of their titles. The ending is also very entertaining and quote worthy. The best story and scripting I've ever seen.Probably the best anime out there.Will be remembered for years. A great first part with minor errors, the second one itÂ´s just not good, they tried to keep the feeling of the beginning unsuccessfully. I'm a big fan of anime but never have I seen one quite like Death Note. Death note is about a teenager named Light who is one of the smartest students in all of Japan. He's too smart for everything and everyone and he thinks that his life is too boring. But one day he finds a mysterious note book, called the death note. Light just thinks it is some stupid joke but he takes it with him home. When he tries it for himself he soon knows what It's all about. When you write a persons name in the notebook that person will die. He then meets the shinigami Ryuk who owns the note book. Light's goal is to be the god of the new world and he kills all the criminals in Japan. The police tries to find Light or Kira, which is his serial killer name. The police takes help from L, who is one of the best detectives in the world. Light and L fights for who is truly Justice.
The story is full with so many plot twists and that's probably one of the best things about it. The characters is also really good especially Light and L, It's so cool to see them coming closer and closer to each other every episode. So this is probably the best anime I've ever seen and I think you should watch it if you haven't. A Good Anime TV Series 
 with Violence, no cringe, Deep Drama, and a good telled Story I heard about this series that its very famous and all that and my friends recommended me to watch but actually i feel nothing special when i started. but now I'm glad that i watched this and it's one of the best series in my life. I watched first 6 (out of 37) episodes and I'm hooked. Although this type of animation goes on my nerves, it's not as bad as in other anime I encountered so far, and the story is so good that I have to see it through, no matter retarded looks of Shinigami and all the other flaws of the genre. This would be excellent feature thriller, either movie or series. If possible, in Japanese or European production, although I doubt even Hollywood could screw it too much. But, speculation on the side, in this form, I rate it<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>As the series progressed, I was more and more tempted to give it a 9, or even 10, but the last episode was a real disappointment. Someone who has been living a triple life for six years and playing the game at such a high level would not make such an amateur mistake. I knew they will get him eventually, but I was expecting some highly intelligent mindfak, not the outworn cliche of a villain exulting in the face of the enemy before his plan succeeded. Final rating<br/><br/>8,5/10 This is the best anime out there, or at least in the top five. If you're not into anime(which I wasn't really), this show is still amazing. Think Breaking Bad meets Sherlock with a supernatural twist. Every episode is riveting and the two lead characters are continually impressive.<br/><br/>I highly recommend. I'm only about 6 episodes in, so I will have to update this in the future. I'm new to anime, with only some exposure via Avatar, Korra, GITS. I actually watched the live-action 2017 movie first, and that piqued my interest enough to check out the original anime. This show already is much more detailed and in-depth than the movie (which I admittedly did like), yet still moves at a very quick pace. I'm definitely curious what there is left to explore in the remainder of a long season, but every episode so far has been very intriguing. There was definitely a lot of thought put into the play between Light and L and their constant intellectual chess (think the intricacies of the story in Primer). Very well done.
Even though I'm new to anime, I know that the English dubbing is a big part of the review. The English dubbing on this show is amazing. Very great voice-acting. The actor voicing Ryuk actually sounds very much like Willem Defoe in the live-action movie-a pleasant coincidence! A great suspenseful clever anime that doesn't rely on action to make it great. Usually I'm not one for any TV show that lacks action and is slow paced but however the suspense keeps me gripped into watching. It is visually stunning with it's dark Gothic tone. The idea of the main protagonist being a bad guy makes it interesting and the cat and mouse chase between a bad guy and a detective makes it so gripping you won't know which side you should root for. First half of the show is enjoyable but without giving any spoilers the second half does go a little down hill but still watchable. Overall great anime and probably one of the best crime dramas to have watched. Even people who aren't into anime may know what Death Note is. It's a franchise that's turned people into fans of the medium. For me, this series has a damn-fine story told throughout its 37 episodes. We're introduced to bored high-school student Light Yagami comes across a book simply branded with 'Death Note'. And the book's power is that 'the human whose name is written in this note shall die'. And the book does just that. Now Light is stuck with this book, along with its owner: Ryuk the 'shinigami'. After using the Death Note to kill some petty criminals, Light starts a crusade to vanquish evil, and 'will become the god of this new world': Kira.<br/><br/>Death Note is well done, and becomes a fun ride and more complicated one, when its best character, 'L' (we never know his real name), is brought into the story in Episode 2 and is Light's equal. And 'L' is my favourite part of the show. He's smart, can outguess even himself in the most outrageous circumstances, and he's completely unpredictable. You can also never tell what he's really thinking; but he fights for JUSTICE! This dynamic is akin to James Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes, Ernst Blofeld and James Bond, The Joker and Batman; Light and L are no exception to these great rivalries.<br/><br/>The story of Death Note is masterfully adapted to the television storytelling format, it looks just like its source-comic book ('manga': as they call comics in Japan) and its amazing cast of characters makes the show easily worth a watch from start to finish.<br/><br/>You want to watch anime but don't know where to start? Well, start here. You'll thank me later. I am not a big follower of Anime. I haven't even watched Dragonball Z, and my only encounter with the genre has been Avatar. I loved Avatar, and I loved Death Note far more. It is by far one of the best shows I have watched, and I have certainly watched a lot. Most shows I watch involve some sort of a mental duel between two equally matched minds (Sherlock vs Moriarty, for example) and Death Note is nothing but that. It has no secondary filler story lines, something which haunts too many good TV shows, and it has only a 37 episode duration, which makes the story focused and tight. This is a must-watch series, irrespective of whether you like Anime or not. It is an excellent show. That's it. This is the best anime that I've ever seen. It has everything done right. First of all, the characters are great and developed nicely. Everyone has a reason to be anywhere and to do what they are doing, you feel for every character and could also relate to them. Then there is the story and script. The plot is so interesting and creative. The story is so original and genius. Nothing is left unexplained. You get to know the characters so well. The story progresses in the best way possible. And when you get more into the story, the more excited and interested you get for the show. It is really commendable how they have directed the show and written the script. The story of this show is like a game of chess, strategical and complex. But the way the story progresses, you understand everything. As I've said that every character is beautifully explained and you feel for the character's gain, loss, sorrows, and aim. Another thing is that the music is beautiful. It pumps you up and there are moments which just make you excited and make you feel like jumping out of your seat. This anime should be seen, it is highly recommended. You'll fall in love with it. I'm a little biased but..... Death Note is the best show ever! How? Well simple it's serious at times,but comical when it needs to be,has amazing fight scenes,but doesn't do it every episode,has likable characters with motivations,etc<br/><br/>The thing is everyone in the series is likable including all the villains I MEAN Jesus IT'S AMAZING I won't give too much away but watch it<br/><br/>It's really engaging and you feel smart watching it<br/><br/>The basic plot (only from ep 1) is that a collage student named Light finds a notebook that when someone's name is written down they die that's the basic premise and it only get's better from there<br/><br/>so just watch it! Yes, this is probably the best thriller ever made on the planet... Well it was a good but I had many confused moments, specially after the second half of the series; too many events were unnecessary!<br/><br/>So is it a must-watch? definitely not
Is it good? it is..
but keep in mind that many incidents were confusing and not told properly
I even noticed many plot holes, nevertheless it was fun to watch.<br/><br/>You'll never find the perfect anime..
many of them will have good and bad episodes;
and speaking of Death Note, I expected something more because 37 episode is considered short in the anime world.<br/><br/>My rate will be 7.5/10
Sorry for the die-hard fans, at least I didn't hate it :p A pure Masterpiece, beyond any definition just hurry up and go watch it Many people saying the second half was was ruined, some said it was worse.... Agreed... But the end wasn't bad, the final three episodes were so powerful, engaging and convincing. The main character was a villain from the very first episode and hence the climax was perfect according to me. Did you just expected that light will really become a God of the World? I saw this anime 7 years ago and from that moment to the present I have seen it too many times complete. Light's story seems exceptionally interesting to me, because it's incredible the transition from a boy with a high IQ, considered one of the best students in Japan and with a promising future, he can be corrupted by the power of death note and a shinigami, becoming a serial killer of all bad people. I think Light is a reflection of uncensored society, because we have all thought that the world would be better if criminals did not exist, and Light's philosophy of creating a world without malice is something that many people share at some point of their life. On the other hand, the development of the anime seems spectacular to me, as the story unfolds in each chapter, and what I like most about this series is that it does not need physical fighting action or supernatural powers such as Dragon ball, but the The protagonists' fight throughout the series is internal, an endless intellectual fight between Light and L throughout the anime to find out who makes the best decisions to play cards in the next move that each one will make. Also, the section of drawing, music, scenography that can be observed and heard in anime fascinates me, it is perfect, especially the music I love, because it hits every specific moment that can be observed. To finish, I can say that this anime I consider it a cult anime that everyone in this world should see it complete at least once in their life, since it is extremely interesting and because it is short of only 37 episodes. Thank you to Japan for this. Thank you for this story, animation, and beautiful drawings, a complete work worth ten of ten. It's not like any other anime, it's story is much mature I think it's a very good anime overall.
What i find interesting is that Light Yagami has a Delusions of Greatness and he thinks that he can judge wheter a person should die or live by writing their names on a death note.If you think about it in real life there are people who think the same as Light and think that criminals should die because they think it would be good for humanity.
However this is just a childdish mindset and only god can judge if someone should live or not.By killing a criminal, you become a criminal too. I think this is the main point Death Note tries to show us.
Also there are a bunch of tactics involved to catch Kira ( Light Yagami) which makes it more interesting to watch. This is definitely my top 1 or 2 for favourite anime's. The storey line is amazing and you find yourself cheering for The guy who is technically the bad guy. The show really draws you in with character development. It's a unique show as well doesn't follow typical Hollywood styles. I love it. "The Death Note" is soo much captivating that you can't resist. You just can't help falling in love with the characters.They are brilliant including the Shimigami! Full of entertainment and suspense that your brain will seriously enjoy. You will keep on guessing " what next? " and will be surprised with a plot twist.
The storyline is short but it's beyond unexpected. Every single thing about this anime is far amazing whether it is characters, plot, soundtracks, animation. Epic background music, best character developments, suspense, the battle of intellects will keep you glued till the end and will make sure to complete all the 37 episodes at a single go.
Each and every episode (of the 1st half especially) having top level intellectual rivalry between Light and L. The plot may seem a bit complex but eventually it will engulf you totally with the flawless presentation.
It is highly recommended and will make you fall in love with Anime. The best psychological thriller one can find in the Animeverse. I am just stunned. From the plot, from the tragic conclusion and and all the meanings of ending scenes. Light died in the middle of stairs, like Ryuk said he won't go to hell nor paradise. All the scenes of his life and of his loved people passing in front of him thinking how it could be if he had never picked that Notebook. Also, before closing his eyes he saw L's spirit or image admitting his defeat or feeling like "At last old friend I'm dead, too". Misa is going to kill herself probably from sadness of Lights death or because her lifespawn reduced to 1/4 after all. I'm also really sad that L died. I really liked him as a character. The genius but harmless guy. At the death scene of Light seeing L, light passing behind L maybe because he went on paradise or because he won evil even after his death. Also, Near and Melo have both characteristics of L. Near has the strange type to sit and the sharpness, Melo eats sweet (chocolate) and acts despite the danger to lose his life. Death note is really masterpiece. Desperately waiting for Sequel or prequel "Death Note", is one of the greatest anime shows I've seen so far.<br/><br/>The story is really interesting.<br/><br/>A High School Student named, Light Yagami, find's a notebook which is known as, "The Death Note". It can kill anybody within 40 seconds when somebody writes his/her's name in the notebook. Later on, Light tries to hide his alter ego when a mysterious detective known as, L, is trying to solve the mystery about the deaths.<br/><br/>The show also has some interesting character's. We have a comic-relief shinigami named, Ryuk. L is interesting. Light Yagami is an interesting villain.<br/><br/>I can't say anything else because this anime show was really great.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good anime show to watch, "Death Note", is worth watching. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a die hard Anime fan but this title has made me want to explore more! Since watching I have open up to the genre! I have never read the manga but now I really want to give it a try. The story follows a young high school student named Light. He is preparing to leave for college in hopes of pursing work in law; just like his father. He is deeply troubled by the mass number of crimes committed all over the world and is out raged with how Japans worst criminals seem to be able to just walk away unpunished.<br/><br/>During this time we also find a different world that is ruled by Death Gods. Higher beings that takes the lives of humans by arranging there deaths. You think this would be an exciting world of horror and adventure but it would seem the world of the death gods is one of boredom. All they do is gamble and joke around causing the boredom for one Death God named Ryuk to become just too intense. Then we find ourselves back in the Human world and Light has discovers a strange note books with the title Death Note. In side there are instructions written in English.<br/><br/>"Who ever name is written in this book will die. Write the person name why picturing his/her face to avoid killing others by the same name. Once the name is written, write the cause of death in the next 40 seconds so that it can happen. If not, they will simply die of a heart of attack. If the cause of death is written then the details must be written in the next six minutes and 40 seconds so they can happen."<br/><br/>Light takes the book home thinking it's a Joke. That is until he test's it out on a pair of criminals with successful results. He latter learns that the Death Note belonged to Ryuk who had thrown the book in to the human world in hopes some one would use it. All in attempt to cure his boredom. Being the new owner of the book, Light decides to take it upon him self to kill ever criminal in Japan and the world. He starts to write the names of every criminal who appear on the news or internet causing them to die of heart attacks. After so many criminals start to die people start to suspect that someone is behind it all. The public comes to know this unknown killer as Kira, meaning killer. Light/Kira actions catches the attention of the world's Greatest Detective, L. A man who's true identity is unknown to all, even those he works with to solve the case. L Promised the public that he would find, catch and put Kira to death. Thus beings the big epic chest match between two rivals. The game is to find the true identity of the other first. If L wins Light go's to jail and receives death but if Light win's, L will die. <br/><br/>That all I will say about the plot. I don't want to give away to much, but it's very interesting to watch this story. When you first meet Light he looks like a nice guy who has noble intentions but as the story moves forward we watch him change in to a monster who's more evil then the people he kills. In fact you may find your self routing for those who are hunting him down more then him by the end of it all. The only down side to this series I can think of is half threw the story we start to meet characters that I found to be annoying, but these are minor draw backs and do not really have a big negative impact on a very good story. I tell you more about them but I would have spoiled too much. The story is very well thought out and well written. Ever move done by Light, L and other Characters is all about trying to stay one step ahead of there opponents. You will be on the edge of your seat as Light make his way to become a New God to rule a world with out crime; even if it means killing good people who stand in his way.<br/><br/>If your an Anime Fan, this is a must see. If your not, it's a great place to start.<br/><br/>That why I give Death Note a 9 out of 10. Death note at first was a great anime as it introduces you to a whole new idea and seems very captivating. Later on throughout the story, it gets really boring and the ending is terrible. The whole concept of a chase mystery genre was a great idea but if they didnt make it so confusing and made a bunch of plot holes it wouldve been much better. Like its a good anime but definitely not on the level as high tier anime like the big 5. Its comparable to some short anime like tokyo ghoul or sword art online which are fantastic anime but comparing it to top tier anime its nowhere near its level Before, I goes into this critic, I just want to make it clear that I didn't dislike this show. In fact, there is only one mistake in that show, but this mistake is so big, that in my opinion it justifies the 4 points that it lost.<br/><br/>First, The concept is excellent, at the very beginning you even don't know in which team you stand, because the motivation and the fact that Light is able to reduce the rate of crime is great, but it also make you think about the meaning of justice.<br/><br/>Second, you have some very powerful moments that changes completely the plot like the death of Raye Penber or the one Naomi Misora. Aswell as the last scenes of the show in which Miss Amane kills herself, or the one of Light.
But the two first were especially important, because they mark the point where you notice that Light is now ready to kill innocent to achieve his goal then you realize that he is more and more evil as the story progress.<br/><br/>Now for the big error that I was talking about, the biggest mistake is the characters of Near and L. Those characters are simply here to put a challenge on Light, but there are not as well written as him. In fact, on that side I think that they have suspicion on Light too fast, throughout the whole show, they don't show any emotions, and they jump to conclusion unrealistically fast. This is why I think that approximately the half of the series where you see them investigate is boring, unrealistic, and repetitive. The beginning was way more full of emotions and heartbreaking scene.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to admit that after the torture scene of Miss Amane, I didn't show anymore understanding to L, he want Light to be executed like Light execute murderers, but for me that is not the true justice, he would do exactly what Light did. He has no remorse for anything like Light, but for me the part that made me decide that L was really the bad guy after all is that he don't even hesitate too torture Misa. I'm almost certain that Light wouldn't have torture anyone. I know life changing sounds like an exaggeration but it's not, I seriously relate to this show in my real life to solve problems. I am not a big fan of lots animes because i don't like the graphics and the visual aspect especially when they try to show those anime fight scenes. BUT The beauty of the writing in Death Note will take you away and you wouldn't notice any visual flaws because the writing is absolutely flawless. The supernatural aspect of the show makes it unrealistic but it is very LOGICAL. Noo loopholes, no character inconsistency to manipulate the plot, characters don't make mistakes, they're are geniuses, things don't just happen everything is explained very logically. The elaboration on the thought process of the characters, the human behavior, deductive skills are TRULY OUT OF THIS WORLD. It touches you on so many levels, on moral, emotional and logical levels and it keeps getting deeper every episode. The thing is I COULD NEVER tell which one is the protagonist and which is the antagonist, They're two geniuses fighting and i love all of them, never have I experienced that in a in a show or film. I have never ever seen better writing in a TV show or a film. Start really great.
addictive binger.
probably lasted too long.
still, great soundtrack and ideas.
very recommended. Came across Death Note while casually googling for the best-est anime, and man did it live up the hype. I know this review is quite outdated regarding the time it was broadcast but can't help but appreciate this classic after having a great time watching this. To anyone considering watching an amazing anime I would recommend this a hundred times. P.s. Don't Waste a lot of time like me, 2 a day should be fine. *Current and the following lines are for the sake of the ten line rule*.you should be a bro and unsubscribe Pewdiepie he has become a cancer to YouTube. This is really amazing though huh you didn't think so; then I'm afraid you are delusional an live in you're own world like friends if you like me because it is amazing plus you will learn friendship wouldn't you yeah you would This is the best anime series i have seen till date ..!! and that is due to many reasons<br/><br/>1.THE STORYLINE: the story is just too awesome and induces all the emotions in a human as you go through each part in the anime..I was laughing,crying,excited,tensed and freakedout through the anime.<br/><br/>2. THE VOICE: the voice for each character has been chosen perfectly and cannot be more perfect<br/><br/>3.THE BACKGROUND MUSIC/SOUND: the background music is one of the best things in this anime which just gets you crazy<br/><br/>4.THE INTELLIGENCE OF THINKING: the way of thinking and action of the characters is just out of this world..I would congratulate the deathnote team on this way of thinking and direction<br/><br/>5.LENGTH OF ANIME: this anime is just 37 episodes ,so you don't have to spend a lot of time into this anime<br/><br/>6.OVERALL: you will never feel bored during watching this and that this anime is full of surprises and intelligence.. The anime series I had watched before this one, Ano Hana, was a solid show but definitely didn't make me fall in love with anime. It had some clichés, some horrific plot holes and overall just didn't blow me away like all my friends said it would. This show, Death Note, was what got me into anime. I'd recommend you go into this anime knowing nothing as all I knew was that it was about a high school student who used a notebook to kill people. The story is written so well and unlike most television series' it doesn't make you anticipate a thing. When you start wanting to know what a character looks like or wondering where a plot point goes it reveals it to you almost immediately yet only then unfolding more plot points and complications to always keep the series tight. The story is so well-written and it's at it's highest point when the characters show off how smart they really are. Also what's so amazing about this show is how many different directions it goes that you just wouldn't expect. Nothing gets dull as interesting situations are always happening and they are presented in such fantastic ways like the subtlety in story-telling, the awesome art-style and really cool music.<br/><br/>The story's themes surround morality and it's presented in such a clever way that you start questioning yourself and who you are really rooting for. A few flaws I have with this anime is that a few plot holes arise at around Episode 20 and the show get's a little underwhelming between Episodes 32-36 but it is horrible because it finishes off brilliantly at Episode 37. This series is impeccable and I recommend it to everyone,especially people who are first getting into anime. 9/10 The show that the addiction is equivalent to heroin consumption. <br/><br/>Intelligence characters, intense interaction and dark atmosphere around the show is the main highlight of Death Note. As the show involve police case, the mystery element of the show will hook everyone up! Many considered to be flawed whereas other believe the show is over- complicated especially with the Death Note rule, thus, causing audience sometime in extreme confusion. Death Note offers unique experience for the audience and I don't think there is no other show similarly like this, one of the best anime out there!<br/><br/>Plot- 8.9 Character- 9 Originality- 10 Animation- 9 Enjoyment- 10 Overall Average- 9.38 Word Summary- Genius Sociopath vs Intelligence Detective Therefore, AWESOME SHOW!!! Obviously anime's have nothing to do with the reality, but the most amusing fact about "Death Note" is this that it keeps the viewers intact with the darkness inside a normal human being of 21st century!!!<br/><br/>The story is just so thrilling and "class" that movies are missing for the past 20 years- - Strongly recommended for not only teens it was good to know that Americans are going to have a movie of the same name and concept i have to say that This show is just as good as Breaking Bad and Code Ge ass. This show is seriously recommended for people who do not want to stay in peace for the rest of their life and keep their hair erect for sometime. I watched this show since it was recommended to me. For me there was no suspense since it was obvious that Kira was gonna lose because they made L a psychic who could tell Kira's every move despite it being a huge leap in logic. Also Near was literally the same as L, there was no point in killing L off if he was just going to be replaced with a worse character. An overall overrated show with no suspense. OK so there's a minor spoiler just Minor I haven't finished the show just yet but I just want to say a few things about this show that is pretty crazy but still not the best its so hard to find the perfect anime show I don't like dragon ball I like attack on titan but the titans were ugly and that was the only negative. Akame GA kill is near perfect but has one problem which I will not spoiler here but the only problem I have with this overly hyped show is "Misa"'s voice in the Japanese version get really annoying and I wish she was dead by now but the engli9sh dub isn't that b ad but if you've watching the episodes with her in Japanese you will be saying "shut the hell up" like a lot or "please just die" that's me I will admit "L" creeps me out but doesn't make it through the series but I do like light and his shinigami there the only really likable characters next to the cops? I"m not sure its still worth checking out but please watch in English DUB or your ears will bleed of annoyance from Misa's voice but again not bad, good but not perfect check it out Death note is my favorite and also my first anime, so far, no anime series can beat it. Of course, because it's my favorite it doesn't mean that it's the best for everyone. Light Yagami's mission to save a world from criminal by being killer himself is, some would say not so good idea. Well, what about Batman or Superman? They also kill people, criminals. And yet, they are superheroes. The idea itself is not completely bad, but development of the story made him do some things that are characteristic of bad and evil people. He was not a gruesome villain at the beginning and with the power of the book, he became one. I like how "Death note" shows us what happens when person has power. Can we change from good to bad or we have all of that inside us, but just showing some of that, depends of situation we're in? What is good and what is bad? These are questions that "Death note" brought into my mind. Light Yagami is one of Japan's best and brightest. During his time in high school he picks up a mysterious notebook which can kill anyone whose name is written in it. He takes it upon himself to cleanse the world of crime. L, a mysterious detective wants nothing more than to catch him. From here on a mysterious intellectual battle ensues. One slip up and it would all be over for either side. Winning means everything. We get sneak peeks at Light's mental condition and L's background. The other characters don't have that much depth to them bust still play an important roles. Deathnote has a gift of keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat. Tension is permanent. It is probably, after code geass, the most intelligent anime I have ever watched. Death Note is without a doubt one of, if not the greatest TV show of all time! Everything from the characters, to the story, to the music, to the visuals are done 100% spot on. The story all begins with a boy called Light Yagami who finds a notebook that claims to have the power to kill anyone who's name is written in it. He soon learns that the book does indeed have the power to kill. All of the characters have an amazing amount of development, the scenes are incredible dramatic, and the story is the kind of genius you would see from Sherlock. Yet another thing to admire about the writing of Death Note was the right place to know when to end the series. There are two places where people could stop watching if they want one ending, or they could choose to keep watching and see the alternate ending. Seriously speaking when it comes to animated series i was the fan of Dragon Ball Z only but after watching death note i was huge fan of it. The music, character, story line, Thrill etc everything is perfect when i started to watch first episode i couldn't stop to watch next episode. I was so curious about what will happen next. Seriously You nailed it guys. <br/><br/>Hats off to the maker of this series. You should think to come up with second season.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure people will love to watch it.<br/><br/>Or else make some more series like this because i guess now people wants to watch some thrill and mental games series like this. <br/><br/>Please consider my request for second season. I'm basically a "big" fan of anime's, still i never took the leisure of commenting or complimenting a particular series but after this one i really got enthusiastic to know something from the fans of Death Note.. From the beginning to the death of L, light was very brilliant and used all the possible ways to kill through death note yet while confronting near he didn't. let me explain, when the follower of Kira comes to the scene where near assembles everyone, "why is it that he is required to carry the entire book wouldn't it be convenient if he used a ball point pen to a piece of paper and write on it like 'light' always did in the past?". anyone could have thought of it because the book itself would attract everyone and they will forget the point that a piece of paper can kill them. <br/><br/>My only logical explanation is that, the writer purposefully made it look like "Light who was an intellectual to actually turn into a foolish person" to end the show... so the ending would have been very good if it was something like "Light getting shot by misa in an unexpected turn of events after killing near". I admit, I am that kind of a person who will read the reviews of others, watch tonnes and tonnes of cinema from all parts of the world, and then mentally agreeing/disagreeing to those reviews. In spite of staying on IMDb for 4 years and giving out several ratings, never wrote a review. This is my first, and I thought my ''first should be special'' :D Death Note is not just a mind boggling back and forth psycho manipulation between Yagami Light and L. It is a tale of deception, lies, a sense of justice within their own minds, and how the decisions of one man can have a chain reaction and make someone else join him up on that ladder, for him or against him. I must praise the dialogue writer and the person who did the background score of this series. It is one of the best, and even though it was subbed, it had me on the edge of my seat. Animation is good, if not great. The premise and plot is mind-blowing, and the character development is class apart. If you miss this series by any chance, don't. This is one of those things which have the potential to change the way you look at things. To be honest this is probably the most overrated anime. It is very good but the fans just exaggerate too much. The ending was pretty dope.<br/><br/>The anime starts of really well with two extremely smart people fighting each other psychologically. It gets viewers excited. However, it was good only till the death of a certain character. After that, the anime was pretty bad.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is really good (I've heard better ones though). Overall, I'd say it deserves a strong 8 but 9 is just giving it too much credit. It's definitely unique and a MUST watch anime but just overrated. Don't let this review make you think it's not good. I only want to say that it's overrated. But its got an amazing plot with amazing characters. Do you know those movies that you have on your computer but you never watch? Well that series was one of those. I had it in my collection for the past 5 years and many times I thought of deleting it. WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE!<br/><br/>I am not really a fan of Manga, actually I do not like to watch Mangas especially if they are not translated. This series was a big surprise to me. You can choose to watch it in Japanese (after the 3 first episodes you will get used to it) or choose the translated version (which is actually really good). <br/><br/>The scenario is so complex and every single episode has a wonderful twist. It is totally unpredictable! The storyline is very fast and they do not spend time or even episodes, building up characters and repeating things you already know.<br/><br/>Those who like Mangas - you are gonna Love it! Those who don't - Give it a try, I promise you will be surprised! Let's get one thing clear: Death Note is not for those who don't like to be challenged or have thoughts provoked. That being said, it was a totally unpredictable, dark, suspenseful, and fascinating show. It's not your typical 'shounen', heck it's not your typical anything. The 'protagonist' is actually the not the 'good guy' depending on your viewpoints, of course. Light Yagami is a bored teen-aged boy with the view that the world is rotten. He finds a notebook which can kill anyone whose name is written in it, as long as the user knows their face as well. He decides to kill off all the criminals in the world. L, the world's greatest detective and technically the antagonist, is trying to catch him. And so it goes. A cat-and-mouse game between two brilliant minds. There isn't too much action; actually, the number of fight scenes can be counted on two hands so far (although I've only read to chapter 75-ish). There's bits of humor that add a little light to the series. The characters are really interesting, unique, and quirky, especially the much-beloved L, a 25-year-old who lives on sugar and rarely wears shoes. This anime will sweep you away and keep you on the edge of your seat. It's part detective show, part fantasy, and all wonderful. It's also being dubbed on Adult Swim and I've seen what they have so far, which is four episodes. They're not doing too bad a job, although L's voice is a little deep and Watari's is annoying. In any case, I'd recommend it to anyone mature enough to get the deep plot line. This anime is definitely in my top 3 of all time. It is unlike any other anime, it is unique.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a genius teenager Yagami Light, who is bored with life. He happens to stumble upon a 'deathnote', which allows him to kill whoevers name he writes in it. Seems straight forward, right? Wrong! The twist and turns, the thrills, the excitement this anime brings are like no other... this anime is not for the dull-minded. It can be classed in the 'cat and mouse' genre but there is so much more to it. You will be pulled in, and you will love it! I could not find another anime for comparison as there is none other like this but, I do watch the mainstream animes such as Bleach and Naruto, and I can tell you this... Death Note is just as brilliant if not better! <br/><br/>A Must-Watch Anime! 10/10 The story begins when a bored immortal God of Dead (Shimigami) drops his Death note to Earth. The Death note has the power to "kill" anyone, who's name is written in it. The Note is found by a brilliant student Light who quickly discovers the demonic power of the Death note and decides to rid the world of all criminals. The mysterious death of criminals all over the world draws the attention of INTERPOL and a full scale investigation led by a genius investigator L is started. At this point starts the conflict between L and Light which escalates with every next episode.<br/><br/>This anime is very intelligent and intriguing. Every episode is unpredictable and although the story evolves fast, it doesn't exhaust its potential and never gets boring. The intellectual fights between the two protagonists are brilliantly worked out and are actually the main string throughout the anime. Every episode L is a step from exposing Light and every episode Light manages to cover himself and divert the investigation. The characters are consistent, the dialog Â– cunning.<br/><br/>The direction, music and animation are also flawless which completes DEATH NOTE near perfection.<br/><br/>No doubt this is one of the best non-action animes I have ever seen. A deserved 10 from me. After L, the show goes downhill in quality. The ending was just bad. Light doesn't trust anyone, but decides to fully trust someone he barely knows. I'm glad they chose not to make another season as I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it after this poorly written ending. L death really hurts .I was backing him since start of the season I must say, that this show started out so great and that I got so hooked up by it, so it is really sad how it stupid it ended...<br/><br/>This show is about Light Yagami, a 17 year old boy who finds the death note. Whatever name he writes into it, the person dies, so he uses his new power to kill a bunch of criminals in an attempt to create a new world without any crime, an utopia with him as the new god of this world. Of course this doesnt stay unnoticed and shortly after he has started to get rid of the criminals he finds himself in a cat and mouse game with L, the world greatest detective who wants to bring him down. The only problem is, that nobody knows who L really is, so whoever finds out the true identity of his opponent first, wins.<br/><br/>The rivalship and the psychological warfare between these two characters develops a fascinating story and tension, which binds you on the screen. The use everything they have, use every trick they have up there sleeve and risk everything to bring the other one down. it is almost like a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>The characters are great in this series, not only L and Light, but also all of the supporting roles deliver a good performance and they do there part in creating this amazing atmosphere and it is fun to see how everyone evolves.<br/><br/>There are many amazing twists in she show, some you may have foreseen, others you may not. And even If you think that this show goes into a direction that you dont like, it resolves it brilliant at turns back to the basic idea of the show. All of it culminates in the "end" and it could have delivered a phenomenal, worthy and satisfying ending to this story and it would have been a 10/10 show... But this doesnt happen and when you think you reached the end, it delivers an unworthy and unsatisfying ending to this story arc, which was just dissapointing. They could have done more with it.<br/><br/>And then they use it to go into a different direction with this show and this is, where the downfall beginns. Because the second story arc of this show just sucks in my opinion. The characters we got to know behave so diffferent and out of the sudden the act so stupid and do stupid decisions. The new characters are just bad rip offs of other characters, which dont seem to act logical and only achive something by luck or by how I said stupid decisions of other characters. All of it led into a really dissapionting ending for me, that wasnt worthy for it after how brilliant it started. Probably are there people who like what they did with the show and how it turned out in the end, and I am happy for them, but for me it didnt work and they ruined a brilliant show which could have delivered an amazing ending.<br/><br/>But still I can really recommend to watch the first act and then simply skip the second act of this show because the first one is really brilliant and you can cleary see when it ended and the second act starts. Or you give it a try and maybe you even like it Well, at least almost nothing. 20+ episodes is just way too much of pointless conversations in combination with more or less interesting twists. If it would have been condensed into half it could have been a good show. There is suspense, thrill, depth, intelligence and moral but also randomness, repetition, cliche and shallowness. Maybe I miss the point of my 1st anime series but from a pure entertainment side it's in my POV average at best. The show starts with a above average/smart high school student finding a notebook that kills the person who's name is written in it. After many episodes you can notice how he changes as a person and sees the world in another way. show you must watch! The first half of the it was brilliant , But the second half was okay not very good or very bad just okay .. But the idea worth watching for sure.. Episode 7 is my favourite episode. That episode give u goosebumps. The idea, the concept, the characters, the story, the drawings are so perfects. From the beginning to the end, Death Note Is a perfect mix of perfects components.
The thing I like most Is the last episode, that Is so moving after all the experiences of Light Yagami. Perfect. The greatest anime I've ever watched!<br/><br/>Filled with so many crossovers,great songs,music and such an epic story,Death Note remains to be on top of my list! #Deathnote
Rating - 9.1/10
An amazing anime, perfect for introducing new fans to anime.
Honestly, this is probably the best thing that I had ever discovered. I never get tired of watching. And now I have watched lots of animes but this still has the best story, best characters and my two favorites characters of all time Yagami Light and L.
I think the way it ends kind of disappointing.
one of my top 10 anime list. There is no anime like Death note. I started my anime journey by this anime. It is worth watching and I expect the second season come soon. Let's meet again soon death note. Welcome to the utopian paradise of Light Yamagi, or, Kira. It's obvious that you need to watch this anime, although I would first recommend reading the manga which is more detailed and thorough, not to take anything away from this anime which is a masterpiece in its own right. If you aren't careful you may get enticed into the terrible ideals that Light uses to establish himself as the God of the New World, the question for you is - Kira or L? Think carefully before you choose, it could be your name in the notebook next... This Anime Storyline Is Like One Hell Of A Kind. The Character Development Is Great And Every Episode Has A Climax. I have seen a lot of animes but this is my fav ever without thinks too much. This anime have the first I recommended for everyone to see anime for the first time Death Note is probably one of the few stories which resonates around the globe thanks to its dark theme and realistic approach to handle human morality.<br/><br/>It is perhaps unique and creative together. That's why it has such a fan following around the world.<br/><br/>The premise is breathtaking. For a person who didn't have any prior understanding of the Manga series, I liked the overall theme. I also liked the way the characters have been written.<br/><br/>The idea of having two strong characters eying for each other's throats is definitely great entertainment. But not only that add some serious writing on to it and one can create legendary show.<br/><br/>Having said that the show has some problems also. One can see those problems more prominently in the second half. The plot seems to go haywire and it shifts its themes. The consistent character design also gets impacted. And in overall the show loses its sheen.<br/><br/>But still the show is definitely a great watch. I know it starts a little bit boring, but I think it's part of the story build up, It is a story of a High school lad, Light Yagomi who finds a book, Death Note, in the field. It comes with rules on it and finds out when you write someone's name he/she can die. He uses it to punish the wrong doers in the society by death, but one thing comes in his way, detective L tasked with the job of finding the person killing people using the note book. Story is amazing.Great idea with full story.This series is better than movie,movie isnt special. The writing, voice acting, art style and music are phenomenal with interesting themes and characters. Due to the laid back and subtle design of the show it's great for people who usually don't like the distinct Japanese style of most anime's. Introduction:
'Death Note' is a perfect animated series of all time, and the first 25 episodes of the show, are some of the best episodes of any show ever put on television. A show with interesting characters, interesting philosophy, and interesting stories. 'Death Note' is a show for any fan of anime.<br/><br/>The Story:
Centering around a high schools honors student, named Light Yagami, that discovers a notebook that kills anyone who's name is written in it. Under the alias of "Kira", he plans to use it to kill off criminals and create a new world where he is god. However, he runs into a few issues, as the world's greatest detective, a man who goes under the alias of "L", is out to stop him from achieving his dream of his Utopian vision, and his extreme ideals on justice.<br/><br/>I'm gonna get this out of the way, 'Death Note' is one of the most excellently written shows out there. From the ideas this show presents on the concept of justice, to the endless questions and discussions this show can bring. To the interactions between all the characters. And the excellent use of symbolism.<br/><br/>With all that, the show leaves the viewer a question. Who is right? Who has the right concept of justice? "L" or "Kira"? On one hand, "Kira's" justice does get results. But the other hand, "L's" is a little more just. And in the show, we see how Light or "Kira" progressively worse, showing the cons of having this kind of power, and what it does to a person. It's honestly comparable to "The Republic" by Plato. However, "L" is no good guy either. He's willing to do truly evil and even illegal things that make him come across as more of an anti-hero. From using people as bait for "Kira", to breaking many laws, in his quest for "Kira".<br/><br/>The concept of the "Death Note" is a scary one. A notebook that can kill people, just by writing a name in it. I just love the concept, and the show lives up to the concept. As to keep consistant with the world building, the "Death Note" has a very specific set of rules. And going over all of them would take too long, but the rules set in the show, prevent any potential confusion from the viewer.<br/><br/>To Conclude the story section of this review, "Death Note" contains truly amazing writing. Some of the best writing of any television series, the show kept me invested while I was watching, and allowed to think about it, when I wasn't watching it.<br/><br/>The Characters:
Both "L' and "Kira" are two of the best characters in all of anime, or even just fiction. This show could've just made "L" and "Kira" opposites, one is willing to kill, one isn't, but it's a little more complicated. "L" and "Kira" in my opinion, are more similar. They both have a sort of childish view of justice, and stubbornly stand for their ideas, and aren't willing to computerize, or see the contradictions in their arguments. Both have an extreme view, but one is clearly more extreme than the other. Light believes that a perfect world should be ruled by one god (himself). And "L" simply thinks a world without crime is not achievable. And even though Light mainly kills criminals, he's not against killing the innocent, if they get in the way of his plans. "L" is not willing to murder the innocent, but he does use them for his own means.<br/><br/>"L" and "Kira" are not the only interesting characters in the cast. As this show has an amazing supporting cast; and choosing my favorite is difficult. Chief Yagami is a pretty interesting character, as he is the father of Light, creating an interesting dynamic between the entire cast. Misa is interesting as she's a supporter of "Kira" and is willing to do anything for him. And many others in the cast.<br/><br/>However, my favorite supporting character, is Ryuk, as what is called a Shinigami, and was the creature that put the "Death Note" on Earth for someone to find, it just so happened it was Light. Just the way Ryuk is simply an observer, not really on a side watching the events happened, as to quote him, "Humans are so interesting." he watches because he is just bored, and just wants something interesting to happen. Plus, the vocal performances in both the English and Japanese dubs is great.<br/><br/>Speaking of that, the voice acting is amazing to hear, as they clearly put all their best effort into their performances.<br/><br/>The Animation:
The animation of this series is a beauty to look at. From the detailed designs, to the nice use of color. The animation style is beautiful, and I don't need to say anything else, sense I think just by looking at it, anyone can tell how good the animation is.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
"Death Note" is an amazing example of how to write a good story, that raises questions, and crafts an entertaining series, that any fan of animation or storytelling, can appreciate, and fall in love with, like I did. The best anime because its art not just anime evey chatacter have a nice voice act My only complain about this series is it's just 1 session. The best anime ever. This would be the kind of anime i'd recommend to someone who hasn't seen one before, it has a more dark and violent theme. It isn't overly long, as much as I like other anime series trying to introduce someone to a show with several hundred episodes is usually a tough sell. It is well thought out and you see the progression of two brilliant characters in Light and L, it's quite intense and surprising plus you get some humour from Ryuk to break things up a bit. I also think the art style goes very under the radar, it's beautiful but it's hard to talk about Death Note and not just talk about the story. From the script to the design to the way ideology of this show is given is absolute perfect, I didn't and i won't see something like this ever again! a phenomenal. Best of besties , one of the great human creature its not just anime You maybe forgot your first love or forgot your first day at school but you never ever forget death note , i used to watch anime in cartoon Network all the time but when I grew up I never felt like to watch anime but one day I watch Netflix death note trailer on YouTube and I am gonna be like I have to watch it , couple months later I was scrolling down top rated tv series and I seen death note .. and that time I started watching death note and it kept me awake the entire night i finished it at 1pm and I missed my class for this . After finished death note I watched Naruto Shippuden , full metal brotherhood these are also great but when it comes to mind games death note .. I can't describe it with words .. and one thing it doesn't matter how many spoiler you get it will still pleasure you more than any other TV, movies ,anime .. it's that much good One of the best thing on internet. It definitely it more than you would hope for. Death note has one of the most interesting concepts, I've ever seen in anime. It's about a Teenage kid, who picks up a notebook that can kill anyone. Concepts like this live and die on how they're executed . Death note is one of those rare occasions when a show doesn't just execute this concept to its upmost potential, it's much much more...Well, let's not get carried away, I'll explain why.<br/><br/>
It starts off with as I said a Teenage kid by the name of Light Yagami picking up a deadly book, that can kill anyone! Light decides to use this notebook to kill all of the criminals in the world. Naturally, the Interpol realizes there is a large increase in criminal deaths and decide to put the best detective in the world a mysterious man only known by the name of L to the job. L, takes up their offer and this is where Death note's story really starts to shine! The relationship between Light and L is very unique. L, considers Light his rival and wants him to be Kira meanwhile, Light wants to kill L and to finally get him off his back. They both despise each other, and this triggers an unpredictable cat and mouse chase between the two in the hopes of one of them "Winning" once and for all. It's unpredictable, that It made me think and guess till the very end. How would Light get out of this situation? How would L trick Light intro revealing himself? Fortunately, Death note isn't just about the mind games. It presents the viewer with pretty thought provoking themes, it makes you question yourself many times. Is Light doing the right thing? Should we really let these ruthless criminals live? Are the rules of society preventing us from creating a better world for mankind? When a story makes you second guess your morals and beliefs like this, you know it's something very special. A common complaint Death note receives is that it had a weak second half. I disagree, I thought the second half was very good. Yea, Near and Mello aren't nearly as charismatic and entertaining as L, but that surely doesn't make them bad characters! They had pretty interesting back stories, and had a certain level of unpredictability that made their intellectual battles with Light all the more entertaining. They also had a pretty interesting relationship, that made me tense up every time they confronted each other. That's not the only reason... It also showed us Light's path to insanity and how the Death note impacted him and changed him into who he hated the most. The way he developed really showed us how greedy humans get when they taste power. He changed from his calm old self into an arrogant jerk, who uses others to get what he wants, and won't let any get in his way no matter what... Even if it requires killing them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The show is basically carried by 4 characters(If you count Misa) the first being, Light Yagami. Light Yagami starts off with a noble wish to stop crime. He's a handsome, intelligent, calm and collected guy. He's a sheltered genius with the with the power to change the world. As the series goes on, he changes bit by bit, and begins to lose sight of himself and forgets who he really was and starts becoming arrogant, and loses his humanity.(This is the 2nd time, I've mentioned this, but it's that good!) This is proven when Light loses his memories! He wants to help the police, doesn't want to use people,and he wants to catch Kira! This always fascinates, and makes me question myself... What if Light never got this deadly book? He could've been one of the good guys! L, is the opposite of Light he's somewhat ugly, dirty, and is more of a mad genius, then a sheltered one. He had a certain charisma and presence that was vital to the show's success. I mentioned before that the death note was dropped from the sky, well who dropped it? It was dropped by a death god by the name of Ryuk! He dropped it for one reason, and one reason only and that's because he was bored! That made me chuckle when I first heard it. Ryuk is a great character, that adds a bit of comedy(Albeit dark comedy) To a pretty dark show. His relationship with Light is Simply extraordinary and is the essence of the show. The chemistry between them is magnificent and they play off of each other naturally. Unfortunately, Ryuk doesn't make as much appearances in the second half as I would've wanted, but I digress. We have Misa, who adds a certain level of appeal to the show? Let's be real, she's completely useless and unnecessary but I still thought she was entertaining to a degree.<br/><br/>
I loved the visuals. They fit the show's dark nature and atmosphere well. The character designs are also very well done and help set Light and L apart from other anime characters. The animation is phenomenal! Just look at the potato chip scene and tell me that's not good animation! I also appreciate the level of detail that was put in the car chase scenes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the best parts of this anime is the soundtrack! The two openings show us how Light changed during the anime. The symbolizes how calm and collected he was at the start of the show, and how prepared he was to change the world for the greater good. Meanwhile, the second one symbolized how Light had changed during the show and how he became corrupted by greed and power. And I'll be honest they made me genuinely excited to watch every episode, they're great. The ost really enhanced the experience and made the show a whole lot better. Seriously, I sometimes rewatch scenes just for the sake of listening to those tracks again. The voice acting is phenomenal in both languages. But I have to give an extra round of applause to the English voice actors! Brad swalie and Julianie Alessandro voiced Light and L magnificently! And they're not alone, all of the English voice actors did a great job. They're voices and the great sound track enhanced the show dramatically and are the main reasons, I prefer the anime over the manga.<br/><br/>
Overall:Death note has delivered on every single aspect, and is easily one of the greatest anime of all time(If not the greatest) And I'll give it my first ever 10/10. A must watch! Seriously, if you haven't watched it get off of mal and immediately watch it NOW! I really liked the show from the beginning. It was intense to watch Kira and L trying to defeat one another. They are both pretty smart and I was surprised more than one time about what they came up with to reach their goals. The main problem occured after L's name was finally written into the death note. L was replaced by Near right away, which just felt wrong for me. It's basically the same character. Why not just leave the case to the rest of the team? (And let Kira win) The new characters where introduced much too fast and weren't really interesting which really bothered me. The second half was still ok I guess but not as good as it could have been. It just felt less interesting because I'd have loved to see what the characters would have done without the help of N. While it does drop of slightly at the end it's so intense. This is the best anime TV series ever made. It is mind blowing. Words can't do justice how amazing it is. It is a must watch. Japan is always the best in creating mind boggling stories. I will never forget the characters. They will be in my hearth till I am dead. I still can't accept......... I don't want to put spoilers.<br/><br/>It's a 100000/10 This series gets more serious than the live action movie!! More detailed and more concept! I love both but, why not the whole background story! This is the best series with an awesome story and plot twists, I have ever witnessed. I never expected an anime to be this good. This one totally changed my thoughts about anime series. The characters were well scripted, L and light Yagami are the best duo, I would suggest. You can't take either of their side. But it did make me sad when a character died. Yes, Ending was not satisfactory for the audience. Its not like we are expecting bad things to win but atleast some satisfying scenes should be there in the last episode. Its like we are wasting our time to watch a good going series to be end like this. Its not bad ending but it is what we predicted it from the start. We know the reality. But we wanted some unreal and unexpected ending which would fullfill both reality and audience. Otherwise ofcourse it is a good thriller experience and must watch. Anime at its best!!!! I love love love this series! The subject is very impressive and interesting, while watching it, always want to know what's next and then you'll watch all of its episodes. This fiction is so fascinating and all of characters in series are very original(i am big fan of light and ryuk). So successful. Suspenseful and twisty. I get why this is so popular, it's deserving of its fame. I'm not a big fan of anime but tbh i can't find best after or before death note. One of the greatest anime series ever. Probably Shonen Jump's greatest work of art. Outstanding script and delivery of the story and plot. Execution of the plot is well thought out and there are no plotholes that I know of. Imaginative awareness is at its best in this anime series.<br/><br/>A 10/10 anime series for sure. Personally I think both the anime and non-anime community would enjoy this series.<br/><br/>PS : Remember to watch the anime series FIRST , if u r planning to watch the Netflix version. To be honest, the Netflix version is a huge downgrade and simply can't be compared with this one. I read the manga but never seen the anime until now, 12 years late. 37 episodes which will make you want more that you will end up finishing it within 2 days. I loved everything about it, the plot, characters who will engage in a sophisticated way of events. Sometimes it relieves the stressful atmosphere with surprising outcomes but often it falls into a sad and bitter taste which hapoens to raise more questions than solving the puzzles. Light and L, Yin and Yang, accompanied by the perfect musical score and dialogues, will surely lure you into a magical realm. Not an anime, but an artwork. I loved this! I usually watch peppier romantic animes so this was different for me. But I enjoyed it SO much! The one thing is that I was so sad about Ryuzaki and Watari! I just feel like Near and Mello just wasn't as fun watching like L. But I don't think it would have ended as it did had they never died... but honestly, my heart broke seeing how betrayed Touta felt when Light confessed. All the characters in the anime have a strong role. Its basically the fight of Light with the rest of the world in order to make this world a better place. I can't believe I skipped this before! 
Cons: After Episode 25, the show isn't as good as it was before. Plus the ending is disapointing.
Pros: Everything else! It's fun, filled with action and plot twists, and it's simply one of the best things I've watched in my life! <br/><br/>Spoiler: God damn, I really cheered for YL!.... It is my first review It contains some spoilers so if you wanna watch the series I advice you not to read it.<br/><br/>As some people said the death of L is unsettling and downfall to the story.But it was evident that Light is one step ahead of L.And the story is good even after it .<br/><br/>The storytelling is great.It is one of Best series I've watched.<br/><br/>Overall I've enjoyed every bit of it . This anime can really prove that how much powerful can an anime character be even without any super powers. Yagami light's brain and the this supernatural phenomenon made the entire anime's content very deep and complexive to understand. Yagami light's motives were mostly unpredictable. His rival L was also very clever, clever than any normal human being. I highly doubt if there are any human with such intelligence exists, may be the authors are one of those people. This show is by far one the best TV shows, not anime, TV shows I have and will ever see. It is a psychological phenomenon that has extremely intelligent characters playing mind games in order to trap the other. The sort of cat-and-mouse premise makes the show really intense, and the show will always be one step ahead of the viewer. Most anime (that I am aware of) has extravagant fighting scenes or scenes of high action. Death Note opts for scenes of contextually high action and and undeniable suspense. The show tackles some varied topics, and will leave you thinking of how or when or why. It constantly pulls the rug from under your feet with its plot and amazing characters. While, like mentioned, it may not contain supremely high action, it emphasizes on its story. As far as the story goes, there is Z E R O filler in Death Note, as it is straight to the point. If you want a break from regular fighting anime, watch this. If you want to experience a battle of only the highest intelligences, watch Death Note. If you want a dark-themed mystery, detective-esque, and overall amazing TV show, don't forget to watch Death Note. Its worth the time, trust me. There is not one thing that I dislike about this show, and it will sit comfortably at the top 3 TV shows I have ever seen for my short and miserable life. The main conflict of this anime has no clear right side or wrong side. People can support Light to become the God of the New World or support L to catch Light (I was on Team Light, because I found L to be annoying on how he comes up with big conclusions). Both of these characters are almost equally smart. This showdown proves that you can create a successful anime without much action. Also, there is some comic relief at times (i.e. the potato chip scene, Matsuda, and Ryuk) and some romantic interests (Misa Amane & Kyomi Takada). You will want a lot more Death Note after you watch this anime.<br/><br/>*Do not watch Netflix's Death Note if you don't want to see one of the best anime series in the world to be ruined* This show is truly amazing. My anime journey began with Death Note. Not just me, but I am sure that most fans began watching anime with Death Note. The battle between Light and L is super exciting and keeps you on your toes. Every time I finish an episode, I start craving for the next one and that's probably the best part about this anime. I highly recommend that everyone must watch Death Note! I was ready to give up on anime. I'd tried watching several anime series and none of them appealed to me. Most of the ones I've watched have had one-dimensional characters, an unrealistically fearless, heroic main character and a below- average plot. And then comes along Death Note. The concept is immediately intriguing and although it toys with moral ideas, it doesn't have so much moralising that it gets in the way of the plot. In fact, it's very plot-focused, with the majority of the focus being on Kira trying to sentence all these people to death without being caught. This makes Death Note a constantly gripping thriller full of ingenious plot twists and a complex plot that sets the mind racing. At first it seems deceptively simple but within a few episodes it's turned into a game between Kira and the authorities as they try to outdo each other in attempts to get one step ahead of each other. It had me hooked till the final shocking episode, and even then I didn't know which way it was going to go. If there's one problem, it's that the focus on plot comes at a cost. Some characters are introduced with strong emotions with seemingly no reasons to feel those emotions. When this happens it seems jarring at first, but you can see why the writers made those decisions as those features are later crucial to the plot. It makes the experience uneven at times though.<br/><br/>Death Note is an excellent series about justice and the best anime I have seen. Astonishing to start with! this anime is one of my most loved I have ever seen this way, Seriously I was the fan of "Death Note". The voice was ideal for each character, and it gave every one the very life you would expect to see.<br/><br/>The activity is incredible, one of the more detailed I have found in anime, and the design of the characters is brilliant. Go watch this anime quickly! I watched all 37 episodes. Yes, the show is extremely well made and extremely interesting. There is no doubt about that. However, about half way through i started getting a terrible feeling in my stomach. I could not tolerate watching what was unfolding on the screen. I started watching more episodes each day. Not so I could see what comes next. But rather so the show could finally end.<br/><br/>Even the ending of this show is disgusting and serves no justice. The show is truly despicable, and people out there need to know both sides. I caution everyone out there. DO NOT trust the ratings. The high rating is because of how interesting, intriguing and well made this show is. It is not, however, a show you should watch.<br/><br/>You will not feel anything but disgust at the end. You will not feel good. You will not feel, well, anything. You have been warned. I have just finished watching the first epi of the TV series, so there's nothing much to comment about actually. Have read the manga, but haven't watch the movie yet. Personally, I can't accept the moral values expressed in this story. But if you don't mind about morality and stuff, then this one is just right for you. Based from what I've read in the manga and if they are going to bring the exact storyline from the manga to anime, then I would say that the first few episodes would certainly be very interesting to watch. It'll give you a jolt to your human conscience, whether it is right or not for a human to act this way or that. Anyway, Ryuk rocks! ^-^ He certainly looks cool and funny in his ragged clothes! He's adorable! So overall, it's worth watching if you are too lazy to read the manga and prefer motion characters. It's a good anime. I'll give it 8/10 but I think in my opinion it's too overrated. Death Note takes a route much different to most other anime.Light Yagami, a high school student who discovers a supernatural notebook from a shinigami named Ryuk that grants its user the ability to kill anyone whose name and face they know.He tries to create new world,free from crime and he means to rule over it as the self proclaimed "God of the new world".Soon, the inexplicable deaths of criminals catch the attention of Interpol and the world-famous detective, 'L'.Death Note is a smart psychological battle from beginning to end.I Love this anime and so would you. it has a good storyline and a great plot but I think the ending could have been handled better. On the first 10 episodes, I thought Death Note was rather interesting and different. I have heard of it before until 6 years later, I went onto YouTube and finally got around watching it. Although as I watched the 10 episodes and the second Kira Misa appeared, I just lost interest. I even lost interest because they were still looking for the real Kira. <br/><br/>I had to skip the 26 episodes and I got to the final episode. I was actually so sad that Light died. He was such a hottie good or bad. Omg his sidekick Ryuk was so creepy, every time he appeared, I had to look away. I know he's meant to be scary but for god sakes, he doesn't blink or show any emotions, it gives me bloody chills when a cartoon character looks like that haha! <br/><br/>I wouldn't call this my favorite anime but I would call it an anime to remember! The best thing that I found about this show is how deeply the "Kira" and "L" think. Both of them are always one step ahead of each other and their "competition" never ends. The creators of this show have really put in a lot of effort. This show greatly inspired me to think more conclusively and to hone my investigatory skills further. I have tried to watch some other anime after being inspired by Death Note, but honestly speaking, none of them entertained me so much. In addition to the characters' sharp thinking, the score is also overwhelming. I can say with utmost certainty that I am a die-hard fan of Death Note now. The characters are easy to follow. It's a must watch. First of all , my advice is to divide the series into 2 seasons, the first 25 episodes=season 1 , the last 12 episodes= season 2<br/><br/>OK now about the 1st season (25 episodes) ... never seen a similar thriller ! this will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat, I have never seen something thrilling and mysterious in my life. The characters will make you love the show. But the best thing is the amount of twists in the show .. I can say they are endless ! Amazing atmosphere ...I couldn't stop watching the show so I watched all episodes continuously without any break ! If I had to describe the 1st season with one world, I would say it is Masterpiece ! <br/><br/>Now the 2nd season (last 12 episodes) ... Unfortunately the writer went for a weird path ..they were not good as the 1st 25 episodes, they were nice and thrilling but not to the level of the 1st 25 episodes .. <br/><br/>So If someone asked me about the show, I would advice him/her just to watch the 1st masterpiece 25 episodes , and ignore the last 12 episodes not to get disappointed<br/><br/>But for me , I will rate it as 10/10, at least the 1st season deserves it, was a unique experience to me. After a special notebook comes from the sky in the world, Light Yagami is the lucky guy to find it. This special book has the power to kill any human. The owner just needs a name and the face of the person he wants to kill. Light Yagami is very smart, high school boy and his purpose is to make the world a better place, without crimes and bad people. When the world's best detective named L comes in the game, Light have to play it careful and smart.<br/><br/>Death Note is one of the greatest Anime and TV Shows I've seen. It has a great storyline and a very smart TV Show. After I watched 3 episodes I knew that this TV Show is going to make me stay late at night. Boredom isn't a question. Every episode gets better.<br/><br/>Light vs L, this is what I enjoyed most about this Show. I hated Light because I felt sorry for a great detective like L. And I hated L because he was a pain in the ass for Light. I wanted both of them to win and lose at the same time. <br/><br/>Fan of Anime or not. It doesn't matter. There's a surprise for you. Death Note is 1 of the best animes i've ever seen, tied 4 first w/ Sword Art Online (SAO). Though it lacks SAO's physical fighting, Death Note has better animation and a lot deeper of a story line. It Gets You Hooked. My friend recommended it 2 me and i reluctantly went home after school 2 watch it. U c, Death Note wasn't the first thing she recommended 2 me (be4 she recommended hetalia, which i thought was just awful)and i was expecting some lame, inappropriate cartoon which she thought was "funny." Death Note was the AMAZING ANIME!!! I watched the episodes 1 through 3 and went 2 bed thinking about it. U could say that by episode 7, I was in love w/ Light (Yagami Light is the main character).He was so clever!! The only thing i didn't like about Death Note was the opening songs. I thought they were just awful, especially song #2. There was a time in my life where I refused to watch anime, but after hearing countless good things about this show from friends and my cousin, I decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>It's not often that I'd feel so strongly about a show that I would write a review for it, especially as soon as I finish the last episode, but this is a different case entirely. The characters are complex and interesting. the protagonist is twisted and dark, who you'll love and hate at the same time. the "antagonist" is technically the good guy, and is so clever that you'll be routing for him, and against him. The relationship between the two is unlike anything I've seen in a show, with hatred, curiosity, and respect mixed into one.<br/><br/>The story is full of twist and turns that will have you on the edge of your seat, and the ending truly wraps up this incredible story perfectly.<br/><br/>Even if you've never watched anime, I would recommend this to anyone. It is so brilliantly twisted, interesting, and dark that it truly deserves it's 9 rating, if not a higher one.<br/><br/>10/10 easily So when I first got into anime this was one of the first series' that I began watching, and I can tell you that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest...at first. So the series follows almost perfect protagonist Light Yagami, who is a flawless student with a clear and promising future, his life is changed however, when he comes across the Death Note, a book holding the powers of a death god. He uses this to wipe the world clean of criminals, but his morals soon come into question. Obviously the authorities notice this and use what they can to catch the person killing the criminals, who is nicknamed 'Kira' The premise is absolutely fantastic but the only thing that did get me at first was how quickly Light descended into madness, by the end of episode one he was already showing signs of it, which got to me a bit. The characters are great and realistic, and Light's rival named 'L' is a complex but equally interesting character, his goal is to catch Kira and soon Light and L have a game of cat and mouse between them, switching roles on occasions. Now here's for the bad parts of Death Note; First off, the series makes the most simplest of things dramatic, for example, there is extremely dramatic music playing while Light is just writing names down in the death note or just eating potato chips, it isn't that bad, but it makes the series look less serious than it should be. Now here's for the main flaw, the series begins to get repetitive, but then gets good again by episode 20, and episode 25 is absolutely brilliant, but after episode 25? It just gets boring as hell, I nearly gave up on the series because of how boring and uninteresting it got, it introduced two characters, Near and Mello. Near is a little sh*t and makes the series worse while Mello just acts cocky and eats chocolate, which didn't really appeal to me and after looking at other reviews, it didn't appeal to a lot of other people. So in conclusion I recommend Death Note highly because it is a must see series for any anime fan out there. Death Note is a fine thriller, the tale of a student named Light Yagami who is given th hee ability to kill people (if he has their name and face) via a notebook called the 'Death Note'. He begins a crusade to rid the world of criminals, all the while pursued by the best detective in the world, the mysterious and introverted L. The best part of Death Note is the rivalry between Light and L. Their interaction is amazing to watch, especially as they outsmart each other at every turn. The mythos for the gods of death, or shinigami, is also great. The show isn't as good after L dies, because it loses the rivalry and the game of cat and mouse between L and Light. Still, Death Note is a thrilling ride, with a few issues that may affect your enjoyment of the second story arc. 8/10. "Death Note" is a Thriller/Mystery anime series directed by Tetsuro Araki, and produced by Madhouse. Consisting of 37 episodes, this series is based on the manga by Tsugumi Ohba.<br/><br/>Basic plot: A young genius named Light Yagami, who dislikes the Japanese justice system, accidentally finds a mysterious book called Death Note. Learning about its power, he kills lots of criminal people one by one by writing their names on the book, in order to become "the God of the new world". Calling himself a "Kira", he even gets a death God named Ryuk as his company. And so a mysterious character called L is presented, and his task is to capture and arrest Kira.<br/><br/>This series has to be one of the most bizarre anime series I've seen so far. The story itself is very original than many of the animes I have watched. Beside from the animation and the story itself being great, once you get into the series, the story gets somewhat more and more complex in later episodes, leading to a suspenseful end. So you might have to pay attention to this in order to understand what is going on.<br/><br/>This anime is basically serious throughout this series, but the funniest part of this anime has to be how Ryuk has to eat apples, just like how we people get addicted to drugs and cigars.<br/><br/>Beside from having watched this anime, I even have a figurine of Misa Amane, a Japanese idol who has a crush on Light Yagami. I bought this figurine while on vacation at Copenhagen, Denmark.<br/><br/>Two animated movies of "Death Note" exist. However, these movies are basically summaries of the original series. Also, three live-action movies based on the same story exist.<br/><br/>Several other bizarre anime series I've watched include: "Elfen Lied", "Gantz" and "Highschool of the Dead". Light Yagami, an intelligent high school student, embarks on a crusade of secrecy after finding a notebook known as the Death Note, which gives him the power to kill anyone when their name is written inside of it. He attempts to rule the world, killing criminals by writing their names in the Death Note. A Shinigami (a "death god") possess a Death Note and can only be seen by a person who uses it. Ryuk is Light's Shinigami, and the two (neither friend nor foe) journey together as Light attempts to take out every bad guy and ultimately by God of a new world. But trouble arouses when a brilliant detective, known as L, takes on the case and begins to outwit Light. A triumph in the manga world. The show always keeps its audience on edge and their ceases to be a dull moment. Merciless to the end, the characters are very three-dimensional and the story is satisfyingly unpredictable. In a tale with such a controversial main character, it finds itself explaining (or justifying) things through dialogue instead of action, which kind of feels like we as the audience are being underestimated. Perhaps maybe some of us are, as there tends to be a line between the fans who support and who are against Light Yagami. A truly powerful series.<br/><br/>***½ The beginning was good. And It went well. Enough traction. But it ended in the worst and most childish way possible with the message (!) that we are becoming stronger if we stick together! So bad that I wished I hadn't started. I don't usually get into anime because I find them too dramatic and over the top for my taste but no this one. I watched this years back and loved it from the start. Not too cheesy and definitely intense enough and had that thriller vibe to it. Loved the characters, the storyline and the art. A fabulous show and totally worth watching. This show didn't give me a great impression the first couple episodes, but once I got further into the series I finally started seeing just how unusual and amazing this show was! Every episode sets up the next one in such a well made way and leaves you dying to want to watch another episode! The main character Light Yagami is the most loved not hated character you'll ever see, he is crazy smart and thinks of everything regardless the situation. L is my favorite character (big surprise) He's very intelligent as well and is adorable. Unfortunately, as the title of this show states, there is quite a bit of death in this show. For those who might be reading this and haven't watched it don't get attached to any characters. Other than that I highly recommend this mini series to anyone! Regardless if you watch anime or not! I can't imagine this series becoming any better than it already is! Absolutely fantastic show you won't be disappointed! This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. This show goes out the boundaries of what you would expect from a show. You don't always want the cookie cutter good guy bad guy stories and this show excelled at this aspect.<br/><br/>10/10 I really didn't care for how this series ended. My advice is that you should definitely watch this, and then stop watching when it starts to go down hill. Never finish it. It is an amazing anime up til then. If you never feel it start to slip in terms of quality, then maybe the ending will be just fine for you. Most interesting , most amazing and one of the best I am new to Anime and this is the first full series I have viewed that is not a film. The characters and story are incredible as are the arcs the characters go through. Ryuk is my favourite character with his love of human world apples and how juicy they are. 🍎 If you are looking for an introduction to anime like I was, give this a watch as I was not disappointed with the time I invested into Death Note. I am excited to see other anime series now and see what else has been created in this beautiful world of ours This might just be my favorite anime of all time! The story, the suspense, the animation, the characters, and the music all 10/10! Sure the series kinda slowed down after L's death but that's the only negative thing I have to say about it. It's certainly one of those series I go back to watch every year! I was just thinking about L and I just figured out that his ideals of justice were really mysterious for example he disagree with Kira for killing criminals that deserves to die and which has also should be given death by law but he opposes Kira because it Is lawfully not right to kill any one expect by the courts and if he really follows that than why he let kill a criminal by Kira in 2 nd episode yes i am taking about Lind L. Tailor is that was right again in latter episode he just wanted to let the company official that has death note he was also ask for light to gain information from Misa by unfair means I think L was not fighting for justice but for his superiority that he can solve any case and he can do anything for that to achieve it. Then how can he say that Kira was wrong I even think that if L got that notebook he even can use note book for better way than light did. Yeah well y'know there is probably something's wrong with you if you don't give this a 10. Episode 25 is its last and it was a glorious ride. Everything worked wonderfully. This Anime contains Thoughts of super minded Light And L. It's all interestingly aggregating & hooking in start but as soon as L dies next episode are just waste of time It was my first Anime which I watched when I entered the anime world and literally I can say this is the reason I started watching more and more anime.<br/><br/>Although Yagami went full viral but still as an overall, the awesome and perfect.<br/><br/>Hats-off! ;) Absolutely the best anime to watch. Follows the manga exactly. My only disappointment is that I watched/read this anime/manga before any other. This being my first set my expectations way too high for other entries in this genre. I love death note. The first half is amazing and entertaining with L being one of the best anime characters ever. A lot of people do like the first half because of that. The anime has an interesting storyline about a notebook that is able to kill anyone who has there name written inside. Other things like giving the notebook user the ability to gain the Shinigami eyes which allows them to see the persons name in front of them. The animation is very stylish, the music is awesome, characters are interesting, voice acting is very well done in both English and Japanese (tho Japanese wins by just a bit imo). The second half of the anime isn't bad or anything like that but the new character they brought in called N was nowhere near as good as L was. L was funny, interesting and just plain awesome all around. Death note is still a great anime that is full of mystery, suspense and has a great storyline. I would give this one a look. This show is absolutely amazing! I have only seen the American "Death Note" -> don't bother if you ask me. But this show, just truly amazing. Every episode leaves you wanting more and more and more. I am about to watch "Death Note" movies now as well - the Japanese ones. Gah. It was the first manga I ever picked up, and I just finished watching the anime for the first time. It's incredible. The writing is so pristine, and good, even if you hate anime, you can appreciate the cleverness of it all, and how the story is one step ahead of you. What a ride, what a glorious ride. It's very difficult to make a good horror story but this one is absolutely great!
I started watching it expecting to see the "usual" horror story but nothing is usual in this story. The atmosphere and the characters are incredibly well developed and realistic, to the point that you will start feeling what they feel. Great job! Death Note is one of my favourite anime with deep story, really good pacing, commentary on society,
incredible characters, intense story, a view of how power can corrupt,
I do have my problems with the anime, I found some of the characters annoying, 
the ending was little rushed, over all it's a really good anime Despite a simple premise this is actually extraordinarily well written with believable characters and motivations. With fantastic Gothic imagery and a well made soundtrack, this is an incredibly entertaining game of cat and mouse that will keep you interested till the end. As soon as I started watching this series, while the start was a bit slow, I loved it. The battle between Light and L was just beautifully written and I couldn't help but just binge the show. But then they had to kill off L and try to bring in Near. Near was not nearly the same as L, and it was sad to see the producers try to make the same rivalry between them that Light had with L. However, I did love the ending where everything came full circle. This is the most intelligent game of cat and mouse you'll ever see. But, surprisingly, after dozens of episodes of mind-bending battles of wits, your brain starts to get tired and you forget who to root for and why. The two main characters are unique and well-developed, and you may find yourself changing your mind about who the protagonist is. However, there are only so many despicable acts that one can forgive. In the end, I was left pondering the big picture: what other potential uses for this power would their be, and why did the show creators choose to only explore the "power-trip" scenario? I can not explain how amazing and awesome this show was, every single episode was excellent. Every episode there was always action going on! I recommend everyone to watch this. Death Note is a dark, electrifying and well written masterfully Cat and Mouse Game . If you need one Anime that brings you in the Anime Medium than look no further. A Thriller Masterpiece. Don't waste any more time and watch this amzing anime one of the best anime a ever watch To put it shortly, Death Note is one of the best animated TV shows to ever air. It matches the quality of TV shows such as Sherlock and True Detective. <br/><br/>Death Note is a Japanese anime about a teenage boy named Light Yagami, who finds a notebook. Whoever's name is written in that note book dies by heart attack. Light takes it upon himself to rid the world of criminals, killing them off one by one. However, a detective named L is trying to figure out who this killer is. Drama ensues.<br/><br/>Where Death Note shines the brightest is its feel of suspense. From episode 1 to 25, the viewer is kept on edge, never knowing what could happen to the characters. After episode 25 when (SPOILER) L dies, the stakes get higher as Near, his successor steps in.<br/><br/>Another great aspect of the show is its characters. Light Yagami, the main character, is in my opinion the greatest. He starts of as noble teenager wanting to help the world, to murderous psychopath. By the end of the series, many will want him dead, especially after he kills L.<br/><br/>And let's talk about L. He is by far the most beloved character, the fan favorite. His character is possibly the most complex and interesting. There is always an area of mystery surrounding him, but he can be really funny and quirky. <br/><br/>There are lots of other characters that are pretty good as well. I can honestly say there is only one character is genuinely did not like, and that's Misa. Misa is Harley Quinn, and Light is the Joker. Only difference is, Harley Quinn has an interesting back story, a unique character. Misa, does not.<br/><br/>The only other thing I did not love are episodes 17 - 36. While they are still brilliant, it is completely beaten by the first 25 episodes. The finale (episode 37), I'm still split on, and so will many people. However, I felt it was satisfying.<br/><br/>The only reason I am not giving this show a 10/10 is due to the second half of the show. However, they are still good and most people will get enjoyment out of them.<br/><br/>Death Note is a near masterwork in animation and TV in general history. I highly recommend it to both anime and non-anime fans. Death Note is arguably the most popular and well-known series in both mainstream and the anime community.The story involves the existence of death note or a notebook of death in which if a person whose name along with the though of their face then that person would die in a few seconds. Ryuk, a death god drops the death note onto earth in hoping that someone would find it and satisfies his boredom.A high school student light yagami finds the death note at his school and starts using it to kill all criminals and thereby create a peaceful world where he can act as it's god.However upon taking law upon his hands light quickly brought police attention and that of the worlds greatest detective known as "L". From there on it become a psychological warfare between the two characters where morals and ideals of a person are questioned.<br/><br/>Death note is without a doubt among the greatest anime's ever made(at least for the first half). It's a Will crafted story with a tight script, amazing soundtrack,smart deducting and a peculiar color pattern. <br/><br/>the first half is basically a psychologically warfare between L and Light. The characters of L and Light are portrayed as intelligent, manipulative and knowledge people who uses questionable methods to find the other and achieve their sense of justice.Light in particular started out as a brilliant and innocent student waiting to join the police force after age but upon finding death note we see light's progression towards a dark nature as little by little as the series progressed.L on the other hand acts as the law but also reveals have no problem in using immoral methods to solve the crimes committed by light.The rivalry exhibited by both light and L is the highlight of the series as it is full of twist,turns and substance.The art direction is really well done often displaying a realistic expressions in picture and the dark and drained color of the art compliments Lights journey to darkness.<br/><br/>One of the best elements in death note is it's music.Every track is brilliant is some ways and the soundtrack's are used so efficiently and effectively that it really gives an addictive world of evil as given by the show.<br/><br/>Howerver as all good things come to an end, Death Note's quality severely dropped after the death of a certain character and the newly brought out characters both N and M were not properly utilized or written thus cheapening the legacy of the series.The finale which resulted in Lights death was among the most divisive finales in anime where in reality the writers tossed away a realistic conclusion and simply bent the plot to give a morally acceptable solution(don't even give me the crap of how mikami's screw up resulting in lights breakdown and even the more lamer excuse given by N on faking the death note and copying the names in one single night). Like i said the quality goes down the drain during the second half however the overall story ark still prevails moreover we witness the dark and evil nature of light yagami from an innocent student to a sociopath.<br/><br/>So overall death note is an iconic and enjoyable anime.The overall morale are basically revealed in the opening episode and the rest is basically an entertaining battle of wits.Highly Attacked<br/><br/>First half(9.5/10), second half(7.5/10), overall(8.75/10). Starts off: Here are the notebook (deathnote) rules and this is what your story is based around. Story moves on writer thinks oh dear I've run out of ideas, I know, I'll add new rules. Started getting tiresome after about 15 episodes. E19 I gave up bored of the fact they couldn't stick to the bloody rules that they set and bored of the thing in general. This could have been a 12 episode masterpiece, it started great but after 19 episodes and not wanting to finish it, it means all that time was wasted. That this is rated more highly than Hunter X Hunter 2011 just doesn't make sense to me. SAO gets loads of flack but it was better than this. At least I could stick it to the end. I hate anime.<br/><br/>This might sound weird coming from a guy who's only two reviews on his account so far are of anime shows, but they're the only two I've seen, and under most conditions, it's a statement that holds true. I find the story lines to be unnecessarily contrived, the visual design to be atrocious, the voice acting to be overdone, and the whole thing all-in-all to be just not for me.<br/><br/>However, if there's ever such a thing as a "gateway" anime, Death Note is undoubtedly it.<br/><br/>If you're like me and skeptical about the prospect of watching any anime, much less this, you should know that almost every single thing that people don't like about anime is not present here. The character designs are sensible (except for the Shinigami, but it makes sense for them), the few action scenes that are here are realistic and not overdone, the voice acting is believable, and most importantly the storyline is very grounded and makes sense, rarely introducing any fantastical elements beyond the premise.<br/><br/>It's all-in-all a story of intrigue and mind games. A story in which one character has a mystical item that can cause the death of anyone that he has the name and face of might not sound particularly challenging for said character, but it quickly grows more complicated than that. For all of it's different plot threads, though, the story never feels like it's taking on more than it can handle and never gets too confusing (except for the ending, which we'll get to later).<br/><br/>The writers dumped most of their characterization into the show's protagonist, Light Yagami. Despite being the protagonist, he's quite clearly the "villain" of the story, making him a character who you simultaneously love and are also rooting against. It's a difficult balance to pull off, but it's done well.<br/><br/>The first season's probably better than the second, but the second is still very much worth your time, even to just see what insane and elaborate schemes will come up next. The show has a good sense of humor but never overdoes its comedic bits, taking a role of comic relief very fitting for such a dark storyline.<br/><br/>Fans of "epic" soundtracks (using the word in as much of the old sense as possible) will also enjoy this aspect; every track in the show is memorable and excellently accompanies the scene it's in.<br/><br/>The story loses a bit of steam around the latter parts of the second season, as new antagonists are introduced that, while likable, can never match the perfect dynamic between Light and L. The conclusion of the story in particular is the only part of the story where I felt lost, but the subsequent scenes were much better and, while not perfect, were still a nice conclusion to the series.<br/><br/>The real victory of this show is that it's one of the most engaging things I've ever watched while having relatively few "action" scenes. The rules of the more fantastical elements are kept constant and logical, and the story avoids introducing new elements in favor of finding new ways to use existing rules. Luckily, none of the sillier parts of the world are ever required to hold up the plot. All-in-all, it's a unique and well-told story, suitable for even the most dedicated dislikers of Japanese animation. Highly recommended. The series is obviously dark. One of the things that I find interesting about Death Note that the protagonist isn't the good guy, like that of the stereotypical protagonist.<br/><br/>Light eventually defeats L and gets him killed but N and Mello find out Kiras identity and ryizaki kills light by writing his name in the notebook.<br/><br/>After watching the first six episodes, I find that the story line is very well though out. Unlike many series, Death Note has a way of keeping ahead of the watcher, and one can never predict what is about to happen. <br/><br/>A MASTERPIECE! After bored Shinigami (god of death) Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world it is found by an equally bored school boy named Light Yagami. Light soon discovers that the instructions in the note book aren't a joke and any name he writes in it will die! He believes that he can use it to bring justice to the world and soon killers are dropping like flies shortly after their details are made public. It isn't long before it becomes clear to law enforcement agencies that somebody must be behind the mysterious deaths and they work to discover who alongside a mysterious detective known only as 'L'. The public also realise what is going on and the killer is given the nickname Kira (Killer). As the series progresses Light plays a game of cat and mouse with the police; at times it looks certain that he is caught and at others it seems that he can get away with anything even when he is enlisted to help the police.<br/><br/>This is a really gripping series that even those who aren't a fan of animation should be able to enjoy. The plot is tight with all the rules of the Death Note explained so we aren't left wondering about possible problems are two people sharing a name and such like. Light is a great protagonist; he is clearly becomes psychotic and frequently kills sympathetic characters just because he fears they could expose him. While this is very much a drama there are some enjoyably light moments such as Ryuk's craving for apples. At thirty seven episodes the series may seem a little long but it needs that long to tell the story in never seems rushed nor does it feel like any episodes are there just to pad things out. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of anime or supernatural thrillers and don't worry if you've already seen the live action version; this deviates from that story and has a totally different ending; an ending that I wasn't certain about till I saw it; as the penultimate episode ended I had no idea whether he'd get away with it or not!<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles. Death Note, at first, sounded like a very generic title to me, with those twists you can foresee without a problem. But after reading the User reviews on IMDb, I tried some episodes of it, and believe me, it got me hooked.<br/><br/>The mystery and suspense in Death Note are par Sherlock Holmes. You can't predict what will happen in the next episodes, and you want more! I almost saw it Back-to-back and finished the whole series in something like a week. Ligh Yagami, the Protagonist, is a genius, and surprises you at every turn, while 'L', the Protagonist, is as every bit genius as light. So, here you see a Clash of minds rather than Swords or guns or anything else, and believe me, it is better than those. So, see it for yourself, and you'll come to know what an anime should be like. Having never reviewed before I felt compelled to write something about death note. Being a fan of all things Movie & TV I'm surprised I didn't do this earlier!... It's amazing what a couple of Jack & Coke's will set you off doing ;)...<br/><br/>Anyway I found this gem of a show through my many trawls of IMDb (what others who saw this have watched, etc...). As you can see by other reviewers it is rather popular with most who watch it...<br/><br/>All I will say is at least watch the first two episodes. If it has not got you by then it never will. The skill of the team that brought this masterpiece to the screen is cleverly shown by the end of the second show.<br/><br/>Peace Out :) Death Note is possibly the best series I've seen. In all honesty the series could have been created as a live action series, as there actually aren't that many animated scenes that are that otherworldly. However, the story is brilliantly woven. Moral lines are almost immediately blurred as we are introduced to different characters who present themselves publicly as moral and righteous, but who privately reveal their true feelings on good and evil, and the true meaning of justice, and to what lengths they'll go to in order to serve it.<br/><br/>A brilliant battle is set up btw good guy and bad guy, where each move they make has serious consequences: people's lives. With each subsequent move btw killer and detective, the viewer is drawn further into the story and can partake in the guilty pleasure of siding with either the killer, the detective, or even both. This series is a must-see for anyone who loves suspense, even for those who don't like anime. Like a lot of people out there, I have a difficult taste in manga (and or anime). Been a fan since the 80ies as soon I saw the Fist of the North Star. That movie knocked me off my Superman socks. So when you get older, ones taste develops.<br/><br/>So when I have a show or animated movie to watch I lower my expectations, not to be disappointed early on. If still disappointed, I turn off the manga. With Death Note I didn't have to do that. It's enjoyable, tense and smart. Love the fact how it turns into; outsmart your opponent. The characters are complex and you will find a lot of paradoxes which are not forced upon you. Death Note in my opinion has one of the best scripts out there. And WATCH IT!! Honestly, this anime is great, but is it the best? ...No. The main character is the bad guy, which is rare. The plot is smart and unpredictable, which is a very good thing. The animation is awesome and helps with the dark tone of this show, and even makes the characters seem more lifelike and stand out. What bothers me about a lot of anime is that when a character walks down a street, it's like he's walking down a still picture since the cars and people are standing still, as if painted into the background. But no, oh no, not this show. The producers and animators and directors and everyone else actually did a very good job adapting this anime from the great SJA *Shonen Jump Advanced) manga of the same name. The characters you love to hate, love or just simply want to drag out of the TV screen just to tell them to shut up are used very well.<br/><br/>My favourite character is L, mainly because I can relate to him with being smart, hardly ever going outside, doesn't wear socks and of course has a major sweet tooth. Now for the plot: Ryuk, a death god (or Shinigami, pick one) is extremely bored with, pardon the pun, 'life' in the world of the Shinigamis drops a notebook into the human world as an experiment. An excelling high school senior who's just as bored with 'actual' life as Ryuk with his world, finds the notebook and picks it up. He reads the instructions of the Death Note, "Those whose name is written in this notebook shall die" and thinks it's all just a big joke. Still, he takes it home and tests it out on some criminal he sees on the news and naturally freaks out when he realizes the Death Note works. Soon though, like a siren, it grabs hold of him and he begins to think that he will become the 'god of the new world' by killing every criminal in the world. This sets off a chain of events that eventually brings in L, a genius detective who works in secret to track down Light, dubbed "Kira" by the public that supports him. Since Light needs a name and a face to kill someone, Light begins his quest to track down L and kill him, all the while with Ryuk watching and giving the odd hilarious remark or comment, mostly about apples. Overall, I give this anime my first ten.<br/><br/>All you Light fans, don't write my name in your own notebook just because I think Light is an ass and L's awesome. Frankly (and this is one of my only complaints about the show) Light should have been caught about thirteen episodes in, maybe even less. He's way too arrogant and careless at first. The whole way he dealt with the Penber situation was so flawed that L should have figured him out. But whatever. It doesn't take much out of the show. Death Note is basically the story of a not so regular high school guy (he happens to be the best student in japan) who finds a notebook with the power of killing people just by writing their names on it and having their their faces in your thoughts wile you do it. The guy starts to kill bad guys all over Japan but the story focuses on his tactics to avoid being caught and sentenced.<br/><br/>Death Note is definitely one of the best series I have ever watched. Its amazing how it keeps you always focused on whats happening. Its like it was on a constant climax state. Characters are really well built and animation is also really good.<br/><br/>I find that the most interesting part of Death Note is that actually the main character is someone that you cant love or hate. You get somewhat attached to him and you don't want him to get caught but at the same time you know he does terrible things (not the killing criminals part but the things he does to avoid being discovered)(not to mention the fact that he cares for no one, and all he does is use people to achieve what he wants) and you kind of hate him for it.<br/><br/>Not just the main character is interesting, but all the other characters are really cool and you get really attached to most of them.<br/><br/>My personal experience watching this series was basically a lot of: NOOOOO!! I Cant Believe this is Happening!! and a couple of other things I cant really mention here. Well, there is just one thing I didn't like... The second opening theme is really really bad... Maybe some of you like it and that is cool. I just don't like that kind of music.<br/><br/>Anyway... I really recommend this series.. it is one of those that you just cant miss. I guarantee you will enjoy it very much. The series starts out very boring and uninspiring after the first episode. The first episode is necessary to bring the story into spectrum though, and every episode after up until the finale (All 36 other episodes) have left me on the edge of my seat wanting to know more. This epic game of cat and mouse between a killer that needs only a name and a face to kill and a detective with interesting quirks that are only surpassed by his ability to deduce and see through situations is a MUST SEE!! You will find yourself wanting to ditch whatever commitments you might have just so that you can sneak in one more episode of the series. Without revealing too much, it is just an amazing plot, a solid error free story line, and an all star team doing the English dubs for the series. It truly is remarkable. It is also necessary to mention that the soundtrack for the series involves you even more and keeps you even more intent on to what might lie around the corner. There is no wonder it is a best seller in Japan! Enjoy it! Japanese Manga (comic book) artists Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata did not know the phenomenon they were about to unleash upon the world when they created "Death Note," which intricately blends elements of fantasy, horror, and the murder mystery into one deeply mystifying and engaging piece of art. It was serialized in Japan's "Weekly Shonen Jump" magazine before being given a green-light for a Madhouse-produced OVA series in 2006.<br/><br/>The story finds its main character in Light Yagami, a bored Japanese high school honor student who one day accidentally discovers the "Death Note," a notebook of otherworldly origin that gives him the ability to kill anyone whose name is written in it. (The Death Note originally belonged to the rogue shinigami - death god - Ryuk, who was bored himself and wanted to see what kind of havoc could be wreaked upon the world of the living.)<br/><br/>After a little trial & error, Light begins to see the virtues of what has been dropped into his possession. At first, he uses the Death Note to rid the world of evil, by eliminating many of society's worst criminals. So in short order, Light goes from being a bored high school honor student to a serial killer with delusions of godhood (he's later named "Kira" - "killer" - by fans of his work). Light's actions are not without consequence, however. Thus, the story adds two wrinkles: It doesn't take long for the authorities to find out that the deaths are somehow connected, and a police investigation is launched. Wrinkle #2 comes in the form of Light playing a cat & mouse game with the authorities and the mysterious and reclusive criminal investigator L, who has vowed to find out who is behind these mysterious deaths and how they're getting away with it.<br/><br/>Having never read the original Manga, I can easily say without any bias that the show has to be a perfect (and logical) elevation for "Death Note." This is one Anime' that really caught my eye, since I saw it on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late one night, and I've constantly been barraged by the Anime' DVDs and original Manga at the local bookstore. So I took a chance and I can say that "Death Note" is now one of my favorite Anime' shows from Japan.<br/><br/>This is a moody, effective, and stunningly envisioned and intelligent Anime'. Being a fan of Anime' myself, I know firsthand that intelligence is never in short order in this genre. The story twists and turns and goes a great many places that are incredibly hard to predict. Also as a fan of fantasy, I'm glad to see that "Death Note" is pretty dark fantasy, and paints a rather chilling view of a world where the lines between life and death have become so blurred that it seems the two coexist. This show is fairly disturbing, with a very disturbed lead character who lives in a world of amorality and is hard to connect with, but he is such a strange and intriguing character, nonetheless.<br/><br/>I hope that wherever "Death Note" goes, it goes to some place good because, after all, once we're gone, all that we'll have in the end is the Death Note.<br/><br/>10/10 Get yourself prepared for sleepless nights..or nightless sleeps. Because this anime is going to make you stand up all night, obsessively trying to watch next episodes. You'll never get enough, and once the series is over, you'll find yourself in a minor depression and wish that you hadn't watched all episodes in just 2 days. Well, at least that's what happened to me. It's about a highly intelligent and popular 17 year old boy, Yagami Light who happens to find a Shinigami's(Death God) Death Note by chance. This supernatural notebook is used to kill people by writing their names on it. And Yagami has some wicked plans for the Death Note in order to create a crime-free world by wiping out criminals with it. But what he didn't take into account was that he'd soon find himself in a battle of minds against another extraordinary man, the best detective in Japan, known as "L". This is simply anime at its best with its captivating plot and clever dialogues. I highly recommend it to everyone, not just to anime lovers most of who, I guess, have already watched this brilliant series. 10/10 Unlike the two movies made of "Death Note", this less than 40 episodes long anime series stays very close to the manga. The plot moves almost picture to picture following manga and we are presented the characters the movies lacked, like Mello, Near and Mikami.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty much the same: Light, a young and brilliant Japanese student finds a Death God's note book, which allows him to kill anyone whose name and face he knows. Light starts to use the book to execute criminals all over the world, believing he is creating a better world. After a while he is started to chase by L, a mysterious detective. The third important part of the story is Misa, a pop model with her own death note.<br/><br/>The characters are well played, animation incredible and music perfect. Each episode is thrilling and leaves to want more. Not to mention voice actors are all perfect, especially Light and L (L is played by the same guy who gave his voice to Inuyasha).<br/><br/>Highly recommended, especially if you loved the manga! I never cared for anime before, my sister literally forced me to watch it, Death Note was... completely amazing. I finally have ended watching the whole TV show. i am shocked, i felt terribly wrong when it ended, i am 19 and never, Never something fictitious made me feel like this, devastated and sad. And, oddly, i supported Light. I think is the most amazing character ever made, he was ambiguously moral, that's what made him so mesmerizing. I wanted (despite the fact that he was the antagonist of the show) him to win. Win, be the god of the new world.<br/><br/>I've never seen such complete characters before, so human. Watch it, you'll not regret it!<br/><br/>Seriously... consummated me completely. An amazing captivating piece of art. After watching Death Note, I got convinced again how intelligent Japanese people are.<br/><br/>The movie is about the rival between Light (symbolizing absolute rule of "superficial" power) and L (symbolizing rule of people), which is full of great strategies planned, smart moves and strong psychological performance shown by both sides. Anime proved to show such complex fiction plots better than a normal movie played by actors. Also, some soundtracks played are just wonderful.<br/><br/>The only objection is that the movie ended so early because of Light's assitant's silly mistake (he went to the bank in an unusual time). I guess the assistant was not so dummy to make such a mistake.<br/><br/>Death Note had to be a 10-star movie. However, because of the point I mentioned above, it became a 9.5-star movie. THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS ANIME IS YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE ANIME WHICH IS BETTER THAN DEATH NOTE . IT IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL . WATCH IT AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT This series is one of best ever, you will fall in love with all characters, BUT it will turn in a utter garbage when Near will appear. -Good Start
-Meh Middle
-Bad Ending<br/><br/>-Light is a flat character
-Convenient plot devices / plot twists to extend the story
-Filler crap to further extend the story
-Cringy monologue
-Show falls apart and becomes a rinse & repeat after a certain main character is deleted.
-Characters on the show are so intelligent but also the dumbest people at the same time.
-Ending felt uncharacteristic to the show. Light still had a page so he would have written everyones name down to die at X hour just in case something went wrong with the 'Hand of Kira's' Death Note. Would have left only Near alive.
-For the most part, Ryuk & the Shinigami mythos disappear towards the end.
-Lights behavior at the end just feels like a slap to the face. Perfekt für groß und klein, klasse Einsteiger Anime ohne viel Superpower I give it 7.5 stars....Eight for the first parts.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead. An ultimately frustrating show for me that went on too long if it was to take the plot line it did.<br/><br/>I'm just going to dwell on my frustrations that held this show from being as good as it should have been.<br/><br/>I feel it weakened when it replaced L with N...almost like for like to extend the story.<br/><br/>Also the company involvement was pretty boring in the middle part. One of my main frustrations which became more and more as the series progressed was that nobody tried to Kill K or his associates. It was ludicrous that K was treated with the softest of kid gloves whilst all around various bad and good characters were being assasinated or dieing in their droves. <br/><br/>K was like a blood soaked terrorist with his finger over the trigger of a bomb. When it was known beyond reasonable doubt who K was somebody should just have killed him, not even for punishment, not even to prevent further serial murders but for mere self-defense...he is killing all the authorities who are after him and can kill by just writing your name. From watching the ending it seemed the only resolution in mind was confronting K with irrefutable evidence AND getting him to confess so they could, not kill him....just lock him up! All the while giving K numerous opportunities to escape or just kill them by writing their names down.<br/><br/>So an interesting show that, for me, just couldn't sustain itself with the plot line it took. I did however appreciate who resolved K's fate...it was quiet apt. I am pretty sure that first two episodes will give u an idea of how fierce is this BATTLE OF WITS. It will surprise you and will keep you at edge of your seat, no kidding. No words can describe its dark beauty. Written intelligently. Thought provoking. Spooky. Clever. Suspenseful. Emotional at times. Madhouse has made it so perfect that i m addicted to it now. This is the experience i never got anywhere else. Hands down. Everything is perfectly well crafted . Even its music gives me goosebumps every time i listen to it. I have to say, this anime has changed me very much. Story: 10/10.. . Animation: 10/10.. . Music: 10/10.. . Overall: 10/10.. My favorite. Highly recommended. I will admit, reviewing this anime will be hard since the first 20-ish episodes are by far some of the best anime episodes of all time but after a certain episode, the show just lost my interest. I'm gonna keep it breif-the show is a 10/10 from eps. 1-20ish and and a 3/10 from 20ish to the end. The last episode is a dissappointment, certain plotlines lack, and the feeling of the show completely changes that left a sour taste by the time the show ends.
The first episodes though... FIRE. I loved nearly 95% of the show from those episodes and if those final episodes wouldn't happen, I would've put it up there with Cowboy Bebop and other classic animes, but it doesn't deserve the spot of one of the best of all time. Though it is certaintly a must-watch if you plan on becoming a weeb unlike me who has only seen about four animes. I have to say that the three movies combined are shorter than the time it would take you to watch the animated series. Not to say that it's not worth your time, but I am on episode 32, and four episodes ago it was really dragging and still is. I'll most likely be finishing the series today, but I will definitely not be watching the two OVA for a while.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong when I say that this series is both amazingly written, and Incredibly acted by the Japanese cast, but when you put too many layers and plot twists into a series it really makes your head spin and wish that the series was over. Not because it's too mentally straining to keep up with all these plot twists, but because they keep introducing characters super late in a series that you know is going to end at episode 37, so you figured why bother? I will say that the last right hand of Kira did they introduced is one of the more interesting, but at the same time it's gotten to the point where you introduce a second L, who is now referred to as N, and he's just a child. He's literally the same character just with white hair and apparently ten times smarter.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great series, but by the end it drags and you really wish that they would stop introducing characters and adding plot twists. Focus on the story that you have already written and stick to that, or make the series longer and really flush out the story that you have created rather than just slap in a new character and expect everybody to just be okay with that.<br/><br/>Update after finishing the series:
What an incredibly disappointing ending. If you want to save yourself some time I'll go ahead and spoil it for you. Near catches light, tricks him and instead of him just going quietly he turns into a squealing little pig and runs away after getting shot several times and then suddenly after all this time, Ryuk he's apparently bored and apparently decides that it's time to write lights name in The Death Note, and that's it. We then get some clips of Misa Misa on a train in a maid outfit and lights dead corpse. That's it. That's the end. 37 episodes. You had 37 episodes to build a great series that started out with a great beginning, and this is how you choose to end it? What a waste of time. Bumped the Stars on my review down further after watching this terrible ending. Not even going to bother watching the two movies that came with the set that I bought. The show was so well planned and precise but, the ending throws it all away. Its a good anime but, DO NOT WATCH UNLESS you are prepared to be disappointed. First of all i love death note, BUT IMDb ratings are untrue (i'd use much stronger words but censoring) if they say death note is more popular than bleach. Personally i prefer death not but everyone in the anime world knows bleach. and everyone that has watched death note has watched bleach but not everyone that has watched bleach has watched death note. This comment was mainly to say IMDb ratings are rigged and are (inserts censored word here). A very poor reflection of what the general public thinks. My friends keep telling that this is the best anime they have seen so I had lots of expectation from it maybe that's why it disappointed me.<br/><br/>why i didn't liked it: * first of all it's video and animation quality is not near today's anime but it's obvious because it was made in 2006 but I like good animation quality. * sometimes story gets predictable (i don't want to write spoilers). * one of my favorite characters died.<br/><br/>why I liked: * It's story line was full of suspense and thrill and some good characters.<br/><br/>but obviously it's my point of view, you should watch it because it's a short series and I think it's worth your time. Death Note is one of those "Definitely Should Watch" anime that my friends kept talking about. The animation is well-crafted and due to the gloomy plot, uses a dark tone of colors frequently to bring more weight and despair to the scenes. The soundtrack in crucial moments rises bringing magnitude to the scene, making it far more surprising and mesmerizing. After seeing it, I'm impressed how good it is. The story premise is already intriguing as it creates a dilemma of how far would you go to make the world a better place as well the sense of justice assigned to what you do to reach this superior world. The entire anime develops, with some rare bumps, an engaging and exciting story, it gives a great emphasis on symbolism. Death Note could be divided, since, in a point, it's added new characters and the story suffers big and relevant changes. Due to the main characters be persons with a extremely high intelligence and the constant chase between them, the plot twists are very constant. The link of Light Yagami and L, their conversations, their nonstop distrust in each other are the most interesting aspect from the anime as we never know what going to happen. Anime,for me,has always been about crazy plots,sometimes crazy characters and mostly bat-s**t insane fights on one side and your usual high school drama interlaced with the usual anime tropes on the other..So,I was surprised when my friend recommended Death Note..Trust me,for a guy who watched DBZ,Naruto and the like,Death Note was different....<br/><br/>It's essentially a Sherlock Holmes type story..Only thing is we're seeing it from Light Yagami's side(You could say he's like Moriarty) and L(Sherlock,I guess)is the detective out to get him,with a dose of magic thrown in.It's the best cat and mouse game between the characters I'd seen in anime.Like Ever.. If you never watched anime,Death Note is a great start.For anime fans,It's a must watch. After watching the series of Death Note I can only describe my feelings towards it as above and beyond. Me being a big fan of anime and manga I dove into this series with high expectations as always, and I have to say this show has earned a 10/10 for good reason.<br/><br/>The entire storyline is a good combination of spookiness, drama and mystery. The originality of the story made it interesting, the drama kept the story fresh and alive with each episode, and the suspenseful mystery kept me at the edge of my seat the whole ride through.<br/><br/>Second, the artwork, the voice acting, and the comparison. The artwork for the scenes and characters were beautifully drawn as many anime, and I felt myself really drawn in with the type of storytelling through what you can see with your own eyes nearly as good as the voice acting, which was superb both in Japanese and English. The voice was perfect for each character, and it gave each one the very life you would expect to see. And next is the comparison to the original manga. They really kept it close and accurate with the book series that I was impressed. Like all anime there were some things they had to wing but it fit just as well with the story.<br/><br/>Now the conclusion. This series was dark, brooding, sinister, dramatic, suspenseful, fun, and a thrill ride beyond what I was expecting. I still have my favorites but this anime series had made it to the top three of my favorite anime, and highly recommend it to anyone who like dark and suspenseful tales knitted with good drama, and intense mystery and desire. Death Note lives to its reputation, and deserves a 10/10. The spoilers in this review are very minor, so don't worry about any obvious plot points being given away.<br/><br/>Death Note is not a show to be watched for the action. It is, at its heart, a detective crime thriller, starring intelligent high school student and anti-hero Light Yagami, who aims to rid the world of evil by killing off every criminal in the world by means of the death note, a book which, when someone's name is written on it, will kill the said person in whichever way the writer specifies. After Light's actions circulate suspicion around the world, it becomes known that a being known as 'Kira' is responsible for these doings. Meanwhile, a team known as the Task Force, including Light's father and an extremely intelligent detective known as L, are quickly on the case, aiming to bring an end to Kira's actions. The show then becomes a battle of wits, as L and Light attempt to outsmart each other and bring the other one down. L and the bumbling Matsuda, another member of the task force, offer some fantastic comic relief, and the constant twists and turns will always keep the viewer on their toes. The plot is clever, if a little confusing, but to keep the originality and slickness of the story, it had to be. I am still amazed as to how they managed to keep the show's complex plot line from having any obvious plot holes - you'll have to look far between the lines to find anything like that. There's a little romance thrown in, but nothing that takes away from the main story. However, it's not just the clever plot but the lovable and memorable characters that really bring this show to life. Light, L, Matsuda, Ryuk, in fact all of the show's main characters have their own unique traits that give their character a wonderfully distinct personality. In fact, I'd go as far to say that the show's only weak main character is the one that ends up replacing what many considered to be the best, including me. Luckily, this character doesn't appear until relatively late on in the show. Unlike lots of anime dubbings (I'm looking at you, Naruto) the acting is, on the whole, very strong, with Julliani as L being the star of the show. They couldn't have picked a better man for the job. Brad Swaile and Brian Dummond also shine as Light and Ryuk, respectively. As original and clever as this show is, it's not without it's share of flaws. The last ten or so episodes of the anime bring in a somewhat annoying character that far outstays their welcome. Some may find the show's main female character's constant stupidity quite entertaining, but it always seemed to show at the worst moments for me. Another problem some have (Although this is very subjective) is that the main character becomes more and more of a villain towards the end, as his actions become more and more malicious, but in my opinion, that's part of what makes the show good - there's no 'Good guy' or 'Bad guy'. It's your choice whether you side with Kira or the Task Force, as the show isn't told from either side's perspective - it's told from yours. Overall, Death Note is one of the greatest television shows ever created. It's constant plot twists and clever writing will make sure you never get bored - it's not for the easily confused, and parts will leave few viewers with dry eyes, but if you want a great detective story with a new and creative concept, this show is most certinately for you. This show, by far through the past half year that I've spent watching anime, is the best one. The show is about a very intelligent high schooler named Light Yagami who is extremely bored until he finds the Death Note. Sometimes later, he also finds Ryuk, the shinigami who dropped the Death Note. Starting during this moment of the show, Light's journey to start a new world with no criminals begins, but shortly after, the hugest detective in the world, L , interfere with his plans when he tries to uncover Kira's identity. The worst thing about this show was the art since it wasn't too unique. Even then, Death Note strides for some huge big marks.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10 I don't think that I've have ever found any show anywhere that had even a remotely close plot to the one this show has. The only problem was that after episode 25, you could sense some of what would happen during the rest of the show's run. But still, the plot is amazing. The show had been very dramatic at some points such as during Light's death and even had somewhat comedy such as when Light and L were chained together. The show had never lost anything, even when Near and Mello came along. It also had a really slow pace to focus on approximately 5 years of Light's life, from high school to him being promoted to the leader of the Japanese police. This was good for the show because it added to the suspense. It actually took time to reveal the plot when compared some other shows that came after it such as Terror in Resonance or blue Exorcist.<br/><br/>Art: 8/10 The art on this show wasn't too unique. The only character designs that I found to have been somewhat different were the shinigamis.The background however, was decorated beautifully enough to contribute to the mood.<br/><br/>Sound: 10/10 The show had a huge diversity of openings and endings. It ha everything from classic rock and roll to heavy metal which I haven't found a lot of shows, even Durarara to have done based off of Death Note. The background music was also great and it also helped the mood. The sound was done pretty well also, it really added to the detail of the show.<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10 The characters on this show were amazing. The most unique thing that I found was that although Light was the protagonist, he technically acted as both, the hero and villain. L was also a good character. I could tell that he inspired some characters which were found in shows after Death Note finished such as Izaya Orihara from Durarara. The only character that was off was Near. He was basically a copy of L. The only thing that was different between both of them was that Near loved playing with toys while L didn't. Misa Amane was also great. Her Gothic nature added to the darkness of the show so she was pretty well developed. Overall the character development was great.<br/><br/>I don't think I have found any show that has come near to or has met the level of Death Note besides Steins;gate so the creator Tetsuro Araki did a fantastic job by creating Death Note. "Death Note" is a controversial, but spectacular, anime show, banned in some countries for its themes. The titular Death Note corresponds to an object fallen from the shinigami world (the gods of death) with the power of causing the death of the person whose name is written on its pages. The story begins when Light Yagami, a brilliant Japanese student, finds the Death Note and starts using it as a way of imparting 'justice' to criminals in Japan. The whole show revolves around the efforts of the police to stop him. More of the focus, though, is concentrated in L, considered the 'best investigator in the world', and his attempt to finally stop the deaths caused by Light, hidden under the name of Kira.<br/><br/>The approach of the subject is mature (though there is some humor), and this is what makes the show so compelling and thought- provoking. There is a lot of symbolism through the show, mostly religious. The animation is great, one of the more detailed I have seen in animes, and the design of the characters is excellent, especially becausethey are not presented with exaggerated proportions (like in other animes) but like if they were real persons. The design of the shinigamis and their world is also an stand out. Special mention is for the design of shadows and illumination in the drawings. The music, also excellent, fits the somber aspect of the story well and feels no tiring. <br/><br/>Characters in the show are well constructed, and the relationship between the main characters is the most intriguing aspect, making an excellent case of the "cat and mouse" detective game. This is what makes "Death Note" so interesting despite some episodes can feel less compelling, like fillers, or despite sometimes the actions of the characters may feel unbelievable. There is also the problem that some of the characters are mostly presented as caricatures (as is the case of Misa Amane), although Light maturing through the show is effectively done.<br/><br/>Still "Death Note" is not just one of the best animes I have seen, it is also one of the best animated shows I have ever seen. It is not perfect but with its gripping story it may even appeal to non-fans of anime.<br/><br/>My Score: 9/10 First and foremost, it is more than an anime. I'll definitely recommend even if you dislike anime. It doesn't have many absurd elements as much as in other popular anime. <br/><br/>You will see cunning plans and clash of two geniuses to beat each other in their games. I got amazed not by the explosions or combat scenes but the ingeniousness of the characters and the surprising events. <br/><br/>It was like watching two people playing a very exiting chess match over their lives. It will also make you question your sense of justice.<br/><br/>Although it is all about the suspense, there exists a lot of moments that you will enjoy a good laugh. Death Note is a fantastic series to watch and enjoy. This Anime is as I describe it to friends, the best thing ever been aired on TV. However, I am not here to praise the anime as its been given justice by thousands of reviewers before me. I am rather here to criticize the critics.<br/><br/>There is one point that the critics seem to repeat it over and over... which is a "logical flaw in the plot" that is how (the hell) did L assume those murders to be preplanned ones. I mean people die everyday, right? Well, no sir. people die everyday but not in a specific pattern. The sudden increase of dying criminals is to be noted. Let alone that they forgot that it was light's decision to be acknowledged. I wouldn't say its easy to make the assumption of a mass murder. But, its not impossible to point either, specially after a long period of time.<br/><br/>Lastly, all the pointed "plot flaws" seem to have a similar pattern. All the critics are bothered of ambiguity on some points, and they take that as a plot flaw. But again, have the anime maker decided to provide specif details of everything that would make the show boring. This is a show not just for anime fans but for everybody loving the mystery genre and love something that makes them use their brains. There are times when you can't help thinking what the next move of the characters is going to be.<br/><br/>The story begins with a Shinigami (death god in Japanese) losing his Death Note (book that kills the person whose name is written in it). A very bright and intelligent student 'Lighht Yagami' finds it and decides to use it to kill the criminals to achieve his dream of crime-free world. What follows afterwords is a continuous battle between Light and a mysterious detective by the name 'L' as both try to outsmart each other in their plans. Both are amazingly smart people and hence it is quite entertaining to watch them as the viewers are sent straight into their minds and we get to experience first hand the logical thinking thinking process of these two geniuses.<br/><br/>Each show promises us something new and awesome. No dull moments. Just when you think that its over for either of the characters they do something unexpected and change the game entirely. You can't help but think what's going to happen next. The appropriately created soundtrack adds to the mystery and excitement.<br/><br/>In the end this short series of just 37 episodes will definitely make you want more of this. This incredible of battle of wits is a must watch. A series that has everything enriching from the characters, to the story, to the animation. A concentrated look on some very interesting 'What If' topics. Light Yagami will go down as one of the most devious and interesting characters of all time, in my opinion at least.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of strategy, role play or mind games, you will love this series from beginning to end. An all out deceptive and ingenious game of chess going on between mastermind characters in this series. And as the plot thickens, you will see the chess match that goes back and forth get even more intense.<br/><br/>The Concept will blow you away too with the Death Notebook in general and with how descriptive everything is pertaining to the Death Notebook. A very slick series with an ambiance of a very unsettling creepiness, a must watch for any fan of a great story, terrific characters, and masterful animation.<br/><br/>Also, the opening song for the first half of the season, not my cup of tea. The opening song for the 2nd half of the season, loved it!! Death Note is a great work of art. It was the first anime I watched having been finally convinced Anime was worth a try and I have to say, I enjoyed every minute. Life and death in the hands of a teenager. Thats such a shocking concept, Very captivating.<br/><br/>What sticks most in mind as my favourite things about Death Note are 1) The masterful presentation of a Byronic Hero in Yagami Light. He becomes very dark, evil at times, yet you still route for him, and secretly hope that he will succeed in creating his new world. 2) The 'valediction' by Ryuk where he says '. Well, it was good while it lasted... We killed some boredom, didn't we? ' just reaffirms what a great piece of literature death note is. That piece of metatexuality just puts the icing on the cake for me. I will surely watch more anime soon. This is fantastic. It touches on deep moral issues, has memorable and interesting characters, fantastic production and totally unexpected plot twists. The only slightly annoying thing is one of the characters and how painfully stupid they are but even that shows how people will do literally anything to get to meet someone. Even the main character you can manage to root on despite his twisted view of justice. I find it is also good because it is such an original story line and I have not seen it anywhere else. I suppose it could be connected loosely to chain mail sort of stuff but adds a sense of psychotic ideals that are completely unrealistic. I began watching Death Note about a month ago. And for anyone thinking of watching, my answer would be a huge "YES!!!!" It is totally worth watching. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat and keep your heart racing until the very end! Trust me, watching this show would not be a mistake. I think that the show masterfully combines great animation with an excellent plot that couldn't be better. The characters are well thought out and interesting, the plot is exciting and fast paced. Honestly this series is the thinking man's action film. Don't get me wrong Death Note is filled with action, but it's not your typical action, this action is deep- rooted psychological thrills and suspense! Honestly I'm not that surprised it was so successful and it's not only something you should watch, bit something you HAVE to watch just to experience the awesomeness that is Death Note. I'll be honest, I don't think there's better anime than Death Note! But if u like it or not, you can determine by watching only few first episodes. But believe me when I say to you that you won't be sorry! Great storyline, checked! (I am too lazy to write such complex and original storyline) Great characters and their development, checked! (Very unique and developed characters) Greatly drawn, checked (Best drawn anime I have seen) Great soundtrack Great thrill checked (my hearth beat at the last episode like never before!) I watched the last episode of Death Note only few weeks ago and I already feel nostalgic when hear the soundtrack) WARNING: After watching Death Note every other anime will look just poor! In short: Death Note is the best anime ever!!! :) This sh*t was mind blowing. Period. I watched Death Note in 48 hrs that's how intense this show is. I've always held anime on another level to Western TV series and Cable hour-longs but Death Note is a complex series because its the only anime besides Monster that can hold its own to some of most brilliant television shows ever written.<br/><br/>Death Note follows the arrogant yet charismatic Light Yagami, who in my opinion is one of the best written and created teenage characters in history. If you take Ted Bundy and give him Spacey's complex from Seven along with the good looks of a Japanese Robert Patterson you get Light. He is a piece of work if there ever was one. Determined to create a world in his own image, he goes on one of the most intense and complex modern reigns of terror the world has ever seen. But his reign soon becomes challenged by one of the most unique characters of all time, L, a Japanese crime profiler who makes Warhol look like the picture of etiquette. Eccentric and straight to the point, he is focused and infatuate with capturing the allusive "Kira" and bringing him to justice. The moves and power plays in this show are mind boggling and jaw dropping to say the least. But Death Note is the quintessential series because regardless of its medium: anime, animation whatever. Its the best thing you've haven't watched! I was very hesitant about watching Death Note as i am not very interested in the anime genre, but soon after watching the first couple of episodes I was hooked. For those who love thriller and psychological genres you will definitely love Death Note. Each 20 minute episode was able to deliver a well written script to guide an intensive storyline. Although the basic synopsis of the show may seem far fetched, the show does not drop the ball when it comes to the plot, as it is able to make the story realistic for modern audiences. For those who decide to watch this you will soon realize why it deserves to claim its position in 'Top TV Series' list. You know what Death-note is like? Soooooo good....<br/><br/>Death not is good.... wait, death note is better than good.... death note is great.... actually its better than great.... its amazingly awesome..... wait its even better than that......... whats better than that? ill tell you what is DEATH NOTE :O :D ......just imagine the best thing that you can think of and ill tell you what is better than that, do you wish to know what it is? DEATH NOTE :OOOO because you know what its like, sooooooooo gooooooood......right now i am thinking of this really awesome thing, actually its my favorite thing in the whole world, but you know what is better than that thing? can you guess? maybe just a little? If you were thinking of Death Note then you would be correct :D soooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooooooooood :DDDDD Death note is the best thriller anime series i have ever watched.It is a perfect combination of thriller, crime,fantasy genre. many times while watching the show i have experienced goosebumps .the show truly binds audience. characters like Light Yagami and L are simply awesome.<br/><br/>script : ten stars. <br/><br/>characters : nine and half stars. music: seven stars.<br/><br/>plot development :nine stars.<br/><br/>over all : nine and half stars. ( but it is a anime which gives complete entertainment to your mind.I haven't seen anime like this so i am giving 10 stars rating to this show.)<br/><br/>10 stars MUST WATCH..BEFORE YOU DIE. !!!!! 't was good! The plot is good, the characters are written well, it has suspense and drama, it has more offer than a normal TV show. It had me entertained all the way through. It had a few downs but there where even more occasions that it had me on the edge of my seat. Together with the "lack" of filler episodes, I say lack because fillers are always bad, makes this series a 10 in my book.<br/><br/>Shows like these make me wonder why the Japanese make good anime with a well written story and crap (live action) series. The series is one with a chess theme, thinking about the actions to take and the possible results it produces. The music is well written to enhance what you see on screen. <br/><br/>If you like this chess genre you might also like the more unrealistic Code Geass. Before I watched Death Note, I had thought about this movie. But after I had watched, I thought this is great. Because while I was watching it, I saw that how much can people be greedy. İnfact I have wanted to watch the other chapter. But before day didn't finish, I had felt that I must sleep. By and by I have watched Death Note's other chapter. I hope people who watched this liked it. İf you had watched it, you would have liked it like me. I can't forget Bay L. Because I liked whose role was so amazing.I have want to watch Death Note's anime version. I hope after school had finished, I can watch it. I learned that people who have got chance must use for humanity. There isn't much out there that comes close to Death Note. Anime has gained somewhat of a reputation for being one-dimensional and focused on action rather than plot and character.<br/><br/>This is not the case in Death Note. This is actually a show that has less action than what you would expect, but masterfully keeps your attention anyways. Death Note focuses on a young man, Light Yagami, who finds a notebook which has the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it. This notebook is accompanied by a Shinigami, a god of death. Light, being an ambitious young man bored with his current state of life, decides to utilize this power. He begins executing criminals, achieving justice. He becomes Kira, the god of a new world. As Light kills more criminals, he is hunted by his own father and a word-renowned genius. Light maintains the illusion that he is a prestigious high school student, while meanwhile he grows more and more ambitious with his killings as Kira. Finally, after the Kira issue has become a tangled web extending across the world, entangling many people, the plot comes to a crashing halt with a conclusion that left me staring at my television with my mouth hanging open long after the ending credits had rolled.<br/><br/>Death Note is an especially unique anime due to the fact that it made me question my own beliefs. I was unsure if I should be supporting Light in his killing of the criminals of the world, or if I should disapprove of his murders.<br/><br/>The issue that haunted me throughout the series and that I still can't stop thinking about: Was Light completely delusional or painfully sane?<br/><br/>Death Note is an amazing blend of fantasy, mystery, and thriller that tackles themes on justice, ethics, and perhaps most of all the painful reality that all humans will die. Aside from the plot, this anime has some beautiful animation, excellent voice acting in the Japanese version at least, and is overall a must-see for not only anime fans but anyone. This is an unforgettable show that will dwell with you for a long time. I'm not much of an anime fan, in fact, outside of a few select films (Akira, among others) and one other television series (Cowboy Bebop), I don't care for it at all. But Death Note is one of the most intriguing, intelligent, gloriously stylized television series to ever blaze across the small screen. Now, I've only seen the first 12 episodes, but I can't wait to see more.<br/><br/>Death Note conveys the story of a young high school student who discovers a notebook, owned by a death god, that can take the life of the person whose name is written in it. Light, the student, decides to use this power to bring justice to criminals, but he soon develops his own perception of justice, killing innocent people who stand in his way, like police officers and FBI agents.<br/><br/>The intrigue of Death Note lies in the character of Light Yagami. He's a mix of intelligence and arrogance, and his twisted sense of justice remains the most interesting part of the show. Light aims to create a world where he is god, by eliminating evil-doers, but has become a evil-doer himself, by taking the lives of innocent people. Add this to entertaining supernatural elements, multi-layered themes, exceptional voice work, solid writing and fitting music, and you have Death Note, a show that defied my expectations and is becoming a fast favourite. A brilliant anime, well written and drawn. I simply love how the characters evolve and how many OMG moments there are in this series. The minds of the two main characters are simply extraordinary, it depends who you believe is the true "justice"<br/><br/>We see a lot of how the mind of Kira works and why he is doing everything, but so very little of "L's" witch makes him so intriguing. His one of the characters that have the best lines ( besides Riuk of course) and his own little rituals remind us of some other super intelligent detectives such as "Hercule Poirot" or " Sherlock Holmes" <br/><br/>The series evolves nicely and gradually, not leaving any plot holes ( or none that i have noticed) Im not going to say any spoiler's because it would be a waist, you must see this anime it really matches and even surpasses some Golden Globe and Emmy winning shows. Don't let the fact that it's and anime fool you. It will grab you and keep you until the very end! I am not an avid anime fan, but I have enjoyed a number of anime series and movie such as Full Metal Alchemist, Naruto, Akira to name a few. Death Note definitely ranks among the top of the animes. <br/><br/>Death Note provides interesting characters, a believable world, and an intriguing plot with smart twists and ideas. The uniqueness of this series stems from its "sherlock holmes" style story. Featuring good and bad forces battling it out through mind games, deception and even with the use of outer dimension beings to manipulate or save the world.<br/><br/>This series is only 37 episodes and is easily watchable over the course of a couple of weeks to a month. If you are an anime fan and considering watching this, then go for it, your in for a treat. This story has a lot of elements that many will appreciate.<br/><br/>It centers around intelligence and the cat and mouse game between the world's most talented detective and Japan's number one high school student as they try to out think each other while putting up a front of being friends.<br/><br/>This is sprinkled with plenty of humor, some romance and action scenes.<br/><br/>Throughout the story there is an underlying philosophical theme of Nietzsche's over-man and whether it is ever right to kill someone. This constantly challenges the viewer to assess who the villain is/are or whether there even is one. Wow, what a masterpiece. Smart, clean, smooth, with one of the most entertaining, unique characters in recent memory - L is made of so much win it's not even funny.<br/><br/>The entire premise is very unique and morally provocative. Not to mention, Light is one of the best anti-hero protagonists EVER, and he throws hands-down the best b****-fits. Bristly, indignant Raito-kun caught off-guard and getting all hissy is beyond awesome. Somebody buy the boy a line of shots and a spa package.<br/><br/>However, there are exactly 1.5 drawbacks for me when it comes to Death Note: First, the Misa character - who the hell thought it was a good idea to stick a high-pitched airhead in the middle of an otherwise perfectly enthralling, intelligent storyline? I know the creators were probably trying to lighten up the mood, but 1, that's hardly fitting, and 2, the resulting gap in intelligence between L and Light on the one hand and Misa on the other is just jarring and kind of misogynistic. And not-really-second, the second story arc did kind of disappoint, especially after the amazing first half. But I don't know if this counts as a full compliant, bc the second half is by no means bad.<br/><br/>And lastly, as with almost all other foreign works, subs > dub. This is the best anime I have ever seen. It is pure genius and purely addictive. I wonder why it was never shown on any TV channels? I recommend it to everyone even if you hate Anime. You will love this its just truly amazing.<br/><br/>The Story is definitely a 10/10 because of all the twists and stuff that glues you to the anime. The Sound fits in perfectly with the anime so I would give that a 10/10 too.<br/><br/>And with only 37 episodes Its Awesome and probably rips every other anime apart.<br/><br/>From start to end it was nothing less than brilliant. Well what can i say?<br/><br/>The IMDb plot is very basic, so here's mine. An intelligent high school student named Light Yagami finds a note book (Called the "Death Note") which has a power: if you write a name in the book whilst thinking of their name, that person dies of a heart attack. So Light decides to rid the world of evil by using this Death Note to kill off all criminals, but then the worlds best detective named L decides to hut down the Light. This series is a battle of the minds to see who wins. Light needs to uncover L's name and face to kill him and L needs to find out Light's face so he can sentence Light to the death penalty.<br/><br/>Death Note is extremely good at getting you on the edge of your seat, each episodes leaves you with a massive cliff hanger so that you are demanding to know what happens next, each episode is an brilliant as the other. I highly recommend watching Death Note, even if you dislike the whole Anime genre, this is a must see! But please, trust me on this, don't watch the movies, before you watch the series! In my opinion, the movie's completely kill the series and they take away all the tense scenes and action and the movies will put you off the series! I'm a fan of anime do it's not strange if I'm interested in an anime series. However, I can't categorize this TV Series as just a plain anime. Death Note is far too good to be in the same category as Bleach or Naruto. The story is too good to miss and the characters are really interesting. Though you can find minor errors in the plot if you try hard enough, it's still the best story ever been written for an anime. In a sense, it's one of best thrillers I've ever seen. It doesn't follow any old-fashioned thriller style which you can guess the end of by merely watching half way through it. It doesn't keeps you waiting impatiently to find "the guy behind it", matter of fact there are no mysteries to find out about in the story, the mystery is the development of story itself! Furthermore, you can't find a character in this series, following the clichÃ©s of an anime, to be too perfect and unreachable till the very last episodes. Each character has its flaws and seems believable and interesting. To be concise, the writer hasn't tried to make the characters interesting by giving them superhuman powers or putting them in weird situations. What makes them interesting is their role in the story and the decision they make regarding the situations. I can only imagine that the guy who wrote this series is a sick GENIUS.<br/><br/>Putting aside the story, the animation is done perfectly and the music follows it quiet well. There are not that many anime clichÃ©s and at some points the story gets too serious that you forget about it being an anime at all.<br/><br/>Overall, excellent Series! 10/10 Deathnote is a unique anime series unlike any other to date. As apposed to being an action, martial arts, mech-robot, cutesy, romantic fantasy (other well known and common anime genres), Deathnote is more a psychological thriller with a supernatural twist.<br/><br/>The characters in this story particularly "Light" ("Kira"/Killer) and "L" and really, really fascinating and it's so thrilling to watch their "cat and mouse" style game played between them throughout the majority of the series. It always seems like one of them is a step ahead of the other but then just when you think you know what's going to happen....BAM!!! A NEW PLOT TWIST!!!!<br/><br/>Deathnote is a great series for anyone not just Anime fans as it is packed full of mystery and intrigue with a great blend of dark humour thrown into the mix and every episode ends on a cliff hanger leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat waiting in eager anticipation for the next chapter in the thrilling Deathnote saga!<br/><br/>This series was brilliant from start right up until the dramatic finale!<br/><br/>Highly recommended!!! A couple of months ago, I was introduced to Death Note; to be honest, at first I wasn't that impressed but gradually I became hooked. As many people know, the story starts with Light Yagami, a straight-A student finding a notebook dropped by a shinigami death god,Ryuk. The rules of the Death Note clearly state, whoevers name is written in the note shall die.With this power Light starts to kill criminals in order to create a perfect world.But when legendary detective,L comes on the case, It turns into a game of life or death. I am completely hooked on Death Note,obsessed is more a word. I watch the anime whenever I can and have read the manga.The live-action was impressive despite the inaccuracy in some parts.Throughout the series, you can see Light's power getting to him and you feel for him in a way. My favourite character had be L:Enough said:) At the end of the anime, all I could say was "what a masterpiece." I truly is and if you are a fan of anime/manga I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>10/10.x This series is one of the most intriguing and clever one I have ever seen. It really surpass any other anime, specially the recent ones. I felt compelled to write a comment on this title since I enjoyed it so much and I feel the obligation to recommend it. Even if you are not that into anime you should take a look on this masterpiece. The characters are very well developed throughout the seasons, the dialog is great and the plot is brilliant (the plot is complicated but it is developed in such a smooth way that you may never get lost). Overall this an excellent thriller and deserves even more attention. I rate this 10 out of 10. This is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. Its is pure imagination, pure genius and purely addictive. I watched the first 4-5 episodes thinking what is this (as its the first bit of Japanese, with English subtitles I have watched). After the 6-7th episode I just ended up wanting more and more. Firstly the storyline is original and second to none. The thought and script in this series is brilliant, and also well translated into English. Secondly the amount of twist that are predictable are hugely outnumbered by the ones that aren't. I'm not really good at writing reviews as I usually end up giving my opinion. But by any means. If you can't watch subtitled versions of these. Watch the English voice acted ones. This is a must watch series for anyone (in my opinion). 10/10 I have been astonished to watch this anime down to the very last episode. I have seen couple of superb works of anime before and after it, but honestly, nothing can reach up to the level of Death Note. I wasn't able to understand why something so genius have never been made into a live-action series before, but then it hit me that it will never be as good as the anime. I realized that after i saw the live-action movies. The main characters were delivered so brilliantly to the level you find yourself attached to one of them. One of the reasons that made it so popular and made it also one of the most controversial animes. Despite the storyline which was shocking at how genius it was, The continuity of the episodes was excellent as well as the music and the digital graphics. <br/><br/>For me, this series can simply compete with all real live-action thriller series running at the moment. That's why i recommend it to even those who never watched anime ever. I had always known about Death Note, even took a quiz on Quizilla that said it would be my favorite AnimÃ©, but never really watched it, until a guy i know suggested it, and i was blown away. The series, how shall i put it, first off it comes up with like 2 crazy twists per episode, it is SO gripping, once you start watching an episode its just joy all the way. Another great thing about the series is its "take side" aspect. You are usually with either "L" or Yagami Light, and no matter who you are with there is going to be a complicated reason to why, its a little like politics (sp?). Truth be told, the series isn't exactly as philosophical (again sp?) as you could expect, but it makes up with this in tension and suspense. Another great thing about the series is the character development, while only a select few characters are fully developed, those who are developed are also special, with a lot of personality and a lot of "I like him because" or "I don't like him because". The music is also very good with a lot of catchy and gripping tracks, although one of them sounds like a rip off of The Exorcist theme with an extra note on top.<br/><br/>B U T ! This is the bad part, after a couple of episodes, the series lose its grip, and about the midsection of it is downright boring, it does pick up a little near the end, but doesn't have the same feeling of every episode being fantastic in their own right. But you can see the rest of the episodes as extra topping, you arn't forced to see them, although you probably would, en mildly enjoy, since you are now related to the series. The first episodes are enough for a perfect score. This is the best anime I've ever seen. I started watching it when I was searching on the internet. The summary didn't seem that good, but I had free time and good reviews of it. The first episode was more than I expected, and when L appeared, I went crazy. What can I say? The characters are awesome, they grow and develop with the anime. Raito Yagami is everything you can expect, L is simply awesome (he's still my favourite character of all time). One of the things that surprised me the most was the soundtrack. Open and ending themes were amazing, but I loved the violins and the crescendo of the sound on tension parts. I also went nuts with Misa's singing. Every fan of anime should watch death note. There's nothing I can say against it. Just see for yourselves. I was nice kind giving the Anime 6 stars. If you want to understand this you have to read the Manga, because I love it to death and back. This Anime adaptation is just disappointing and cheesy. I just completed it because I felt the need to, not because I enjoyed it. I don't need to talk about the ending and the sentimental with L and Light in the rain. If you make and animation about such a good Manga then why do you need to add all this clichÃ© stuff into it? Giving Misa this much attention was also a nice marketing strategy, but this won't earn quality points. The potato chip scene was pretty nice though. It's still an amazing story so 6. I liked the imagery, however I had great difficulty understanding the strange noises the characters were making. One word: Why... It's a great anime and all for the most part, but there are a few things that bug me. First off, what is with that potatoe chip meme? That is just ridiculous in my opinion. Makes my not want to eat potatoe chips. And another: I would have liked this series better if a few things didn't happen. It is interesting to see the characters scheme and chase each other around in conflicting ideas of justice, but why did they have to kill L? Just why? He had to have been my favorite character besides Ryuk. And the rest of the anime was just a downfall from there. None of the other characters like Near for example were nearly as good ad L was. I miss him *sniffle*. The other thing that I had a problem with was the ending. What kind of an ending is that? Light gets ruined by having the Death Note swapped out. Seriously? That is way too simple! And he dies from a bullet wound, and the last thing we see is Light closing his eyes. Wow. I wanted to chuck my tablet across the room after that. I wanted to do the same thing to Cowboy Bebop's ending because it was basically the same thing. Both of the main characters from Cowboy Bebop and Death Note die from bullet wounds and The End. That's not how it works! Other than that though, I consider the series as OK. It was entertaining enough and wasn't boring. Just some major problems that drove me crazy. One of the best anime I have ever seen..the thriller makes me so crazy ðŸ”¥but in the end the script was too weak.ending was trash but everything is perfect until L dies.. Good first part
Then lack of imagination , it becomes garbage.. If you like the plot and writing of Death Note but can't get over the fact that all the women are poorly written and exist only the further the plot, watch Psycho-Pass. Death Note is about a high school student called Light, obtaining a death note, which can kill people if their name is written in it.<br/><br/>The animation is made by Madhouse and the anime is a manga adaption, made by
Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata.<br/><br/>Death Note is a very tense thriller with psychological aspects in it. It has themes of death and God. The characters were very interesting and there was clear character development in the main character, Light. One criticism is that the female characters were not well written and it had mostly male characters.<br/><br/>The story was great and had me at the edge of my seat. I thought the anime was great although out its run. It was my first anime. It was really exciting and good. There is a lot of information and details in this anime and I love it so much.
I still don't understand why people don't like it so much, maybe because it does not have a love story, or maybe because it's too much "talking" for some people to be interested in.
You know why he does the stuff that he does (not like other shows where the bad guy is bad because... no reason).
I like how he doesn't let a relationship get in the way of his main plan, or how at the start he says that he must take care of his health so he can do this for as long as possible.
I think most of us was thinking: what if there really was a God that kills the bad guys? And what if that God was actually human?
I'm not a big fan of the ending but that's maybe because I didn't really want the show to end, because I know I can never see an interesting idea as the creator of Death Note had.
I want to thank the creator of Death Note that he didn't made the anymore longer, with fillers, like most of the shows do. Yes, I believe this title represents this anime the best. However, I suppose it does require an explanation.<br/><br/>1. First of all, it is a rare bouquet of vidid characters, clever plot and lots of tension and suspense. There may be a few dragged out scenes and some that could be considered "cheesy", but... it's not your regular anime, it stands out and doesn't rely on the common tropes. Hence the overall comparison to something as impossible as "lightning in a bottle".<br/><br/>2. However, what is lightning? Can it truly be... suspended in a bottle? No, obviously not. Lightning is a force of nature, and the series presents us with very meticulous, sometimes downright annoying worldbuilding, but... sadly nothing comes out of it. What does lightning in a bottle look like? A fancy custom LED. This is pretty much how all the world building feels in this series - very, very intricate, yet very, very downplayed.<br/><br/>3. Finally - what is a bottle? Obviously it's a very tight space. This is because the biggest problem is that the protagonist, who drives the plot, has to be... himself. That's as much as I can say without spoiling anything. He essentially has lightning in his hands, his potential - limitless. But throughout all of his ordeals he has to remain... himself. The ultimate prison. As much as 75% of the plot could be unraveled and discarded if only the protagonist would drop these shackles and embrace his goal.<br/><br/>Additionally, this series suffers from a curse of anything with a limited runtime: series, anime, movies... The curse of rushed resolution. A lot of the best works of art in this category begin by bringing out the biggest guns, the most intricate and interesting plot. They captivate the audience and give the illusion of quality. But... the bigger you build your world, the more the looming truth of limited runtime digs in. And you have to write yourself out of it somehow. Obviously the manga doesn't have such constraints, but this series - do. In fact so much that... it's basically necessary to watch Death Note Relight 1\2. Again, that's as much as I can say without spoilers. The series is wonderful, and it must be watched in its entirety, because it still has the highest runtime, however, because of the fact that it relies on post-series content that merely retouches the... uhm... "subverted expectations", without truly fixing the issues of the "lightning" and the "bottle" - I give it only 8\10. This is the best anime series ever. period. No comparison. No missing link. Just THE GREATEST anime. I first watched this whilst staying with friends at a community house in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia in mid 2014. As soon as I began episode 1, I couldn't stop watching right until the very end. It's very fast pace and never loses traction right through. I was floored from episode to episode right until it was suddenly over, and I realised I completely lost track of time.<br/><br/>It's an extremely strong series, one of the best ever. I can hardly think of a single flaw. It takes more attention to watch than your average viewing experience, especially if you don't speak Japanese and are watching the subbed version (which in this instance I would strongly suggest instead of the dub).<br/><br/>The writing, acting, pacing, character building, music, and cinematography are all pretty much perfect. It's certainly a great piece to study in film school if you're looking for a suitable candidate. My first anime death note
It was just awesome
L was my favorite character When asked the question; "what is the best anime," Death Note should be in the conversation. This show is GRIPPING. The viewer is almost always on the edge of their seat. The characters are very, very intelligent and capable in their roles.<br/><br/>It's an awesome show. Death Note was my first anime ever, so it holds a special place in my heart. It is, without a doubt, one of the best animes I have ever seen. There may be no epic mecha-kaiju battles, but the cerebral war waged by Light and L is just gold. Those were some of the most gripping and binge-worthy scenes I have ever watched.
The ending though... Why'd they have to include Near and Mello? They couldn't hold a candle to the fire that was L.
Still, I recommend watching it purely for the great writing.
Also for the potato chip scene. Such an amizing TV series that made me fall in love with Japanese Anime.
Such twists, and in depth story is very rare.
Just fantastic!!! Because of "L" & light yagami demise some people gave ratings only 6,7,8. They couldn't accept their favourite character to get defeated 😂 (Im also L fan). This is the real reason, they gave average ratings, if you don't believe me, you can check the reviews !!!<br/><br/>Grow up kiddos! Don't show favourisim in ratings!!!<br/><br/>Actually after the L demise only we could see some changes, new characters will join the plot, which makes quite interesting instead of watching same characters same place again & again!!!<br/><br/>My favourite things of Death note series!!!
It is one of the top most animation series to have the best writing ever!!! The bgm had been scored right time at right place throughout the series which makes more to enjoy the scene !!!
My rating 10/10😉 The relationship between the main protagonist and antagonist alone, and the development of these characters were enough to warrant this show a perfect rating. So from where do i start? I am too confused how to share my opinion. Let's start with characters. Each and every character in this anime is very well developed no matter how small that character is, he/she leads to a great impact towards the story. And about the story, it is impossible to explain the story of death note. This anime is short but its story is very complex. Each and every scene shocks us up to a great extent.<br/><br/>
It has everything a good series should. Great characters, character development, story, intense situation build up, thrill, emotions ,super smart investigation and many other things.
Even giving 10/10 to this masterpiece will be quiet unfair because it deserves even more.<br/><br/>I thinks imdb provide more than 10 stars feature
for some Masterpiece like death note. So this is the pinnacle of anime? You know what I'm not disappointed at all cause this show is brilliant, iconic aswell.
Let me also say that the 9 out of 10 is, yes, because of the post L episodes. I don't think they're bad but there definitely lacking, especially since they just added L 2.0 anyway (seriously Near kinda sucked).
Great ending though, great dub, great animation and oh man the writing. This show really makes you think. Once you side with L you see him kidnap a model, once you side with Light you see him kill, well, everyone.
Death Note is great, no point ignoring that. I still think that Fma:B is superior but if I were to recommend any anime it's this one, check it out Simply disgusting. I have so many things to say but right now I just don't wanna write anything. I dont think i should waste time trying to explain why I like it. Its the same reason as for everyone else: Amazing plot, well developed characters, great underlying theme, and a nice bow to wrap it all up(the very sad ending). I wanna write this to the haters and make a point(even though most of them wont even read this comment)<br/><br/>Some people may dislike this show for a few reasons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Odd Concept</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Have a different taste for anime</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dislike the personalities of the characters</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wanna be haters</li></ul><br/><br/>I respect you if you feel that way about this show(except if you're the fourth option, then I don't have any respect for you as a human being). However, reviews don't have to be so staggeringly low for these reasons.<br/><br/>the concept behind death note was that based around a very specific idea. Its a style of concept making used in many popular animes(one punch man and naruto). The potential in this idea wasn't too much to be honest. There's not a lot you can do with a notebook of death. However, the creators of this show, put their greatest effort to extract as much of a story as they could from the idea itself. It is comparable to squeezing a lemon. Good tv shows always happen when either a good "lemon" is squeezed enough or an ordinary "lemon" is squeezed to the fullest(the second one being the concept of death note). While the idea is unappealing in the way it sounds, how it is used is what made this tv show amazing. My first anime experience, always hated Japanese movie and series didnt like them when ever i heard about them btw this is different its anime but they belong same, i didnt got any interest in this kinda things but this changed my mind and realized how big is Japanese universe still dont got interest for their movies and series but it catched my heart to animes, we all know japan is one of the most developed countries i imagine how much they have abilities in cinamatic, this is just a different experience, death note the plot is so interesting Havent saw any of the plot and its not repetitive great great and great story, just try it how much this anime makes sense most times they are greater than movies, the acting is just awesome the main characters are so good especially light yagami and L the two rivals who where challenging thier abilities to gain what they want, they made the story suspenseful when they added too many backstories and secrets with light yagami and L, until L was alive it made sense more i liked L i wanted the series to be finished with him but they added more episodes dont know why! till the end i waited for L to comeback i had a sense that he was still there but unfortunately he didnt came back, the other half wasnt like the first half of the series the first was better, we discovered many good actors they all build their characters in it,and the soundtrack was good too, dont got problem with the shoting style wasnt bored with it dont know if it makes difference with other series or not, we discovered many brilliant ideas with the backstories, really deserve the time, enjoyable and fun, last episode i felt sad i left the series it had emotional moments at the end, and really well done script plays, and btw i watched the dubbed version Eng of it they done a good job there, at the end its well crafted just try out if you haven't watched any animes, 10/10⭐ This show amazing and incredible. The strory is just awesome. I just love Light the main character and His ideology. Character justify his ideology. Death Note is the first anime I've ever watched. It's truly great from every point of view. I recommend it to everyone, even if you are or not an anime guy. The start i so good i love it all but then we go to were Neal i begin to dont like whats happening and I think that Kira should have won if Kira won i would love series Even more than i do My favourite show ever i can bet that it has no no plot holes or paradox in story line. Best series ever made but I was little disappointed in the end but it still worrth 10 stars. Unbelievable anime,,i love this work from all of my heart Its riquire a high (IQ) to understand what's happening
Because the main charcters have over than (180 IQ Points) Its greatest series of all time<br/><br/>amazin soundtrackt<br/><br/>and amazin character The show is very perfect, the characters are very intelligent and awesome. This anime has one of the best storyline I ever seen. This series has brilliant setup. First 17 episodes are great! 13,14,15 are lot more entertaining because introduction of the character Misa Amane. Her character is amazing & true to it's form. After that it's just boring! They changed title song & whole tone by background music. Then it goes boring like cat and mouse game. Rated for second half of series and all the stretch. Otherwise would have rated 10/10 for first couple of episodes. First few episodes are brilliant!! But after that it's just cat and mouse game! Disappointed because of long stretch. But setup was brilliant! I think till 14 episodes it's amazing. Otherwise rated 10 This anime is mainly about a genius student Light Yagami vs a super detective L. The theme is about the Dualism, both want Justice in this world but with really different approach. You can expect easy to follow plot but with complex multiple stages of thinking from this anime. I also want to mention that this anime have one of the best soundtrack in anime.<br/><br/>p.s. It's my subjective opinion but I suggest you to stop after Light vs L battle is finished. Beyond that is different realm that really different than original Light vs L part. If the end was the victory of kera then it would be the worst thing in the history of entertainment, evil always lose I love this anime! Everything about this anime is just perfect. There was never a time when I was bored. I would recommend this anime to everyone. It's a great first timer anime. Fantastic overall! It has the best character development the best visuals the best music. We can connect to the story protagonist. There anime stucks in your head. This anime is just amazing...you gonna fall in love with it just by watching its starting 2 episodes...it is an absolute thriller you could ever ask for...till episode 25 it is a 10/10 anime but after that its level falls drastically This anime is not that long, and still I did not want to watch the whole anime because i was disappointed by the lack of skill of the Death Note user. Leaving plot holes for him to be easily revealed at first. I really like the character L and the new detective just did not work for me, so i stopped watching after L died. I think this is not an anime for children because it is pretty dark in nature, the characters are shallow and not that developed. The plot is easy to see although if u do not watch the whole time of an episode and if you are not that into it you are gonna get confused. There is also no comedy in this anime of course. The music is a bit irritating and the main character is most probably a Hitler no.1 fanboy. Even if i was not a detective i would clearly see that he was the killer in the anime just from his attitude and the nervousness and anger he emits while trying to be deceptive. Overrated by a landslide if there were more episodes of this anime i would doubt it would be so appreciated as it is, and not so many people would watch it. I would place it bellow Naruto and One Piece simply because of the difference in filled capacity of the script. I think this anime could have been a lot more interesting, and not so nervously agitated. Death Note is not your standard anime nor is it your standard TV show for that matter. It's a psychological drama that excels at probing into questions of morality and what it means to be good and evil. It focuses on a cat and mouse chase between hunter and hunted but it's masked through the idea of criminal vs detective and what's crazy is that there are times when you can't tell who you're rooting for. <br/><br/>The show uses anime inner monologues to their fullest by using them for exactly what they should be, inner monologues. It actually sort of feels like something Shakespeare would have written and it plays masterfully when each character tries to outsmart the other. Each scene gets more intense as the conflict escalates and nothing ever seems simple. Even when you think that something has been solved or recieved closure, a new element brings it back until you can't imagine how it can get more intense, which makes it all the more satisfying when you're proven wrong. <br/><br/>Death Note shows that an anime doesn't have to be action packed to be interesting, nor does it have to be overly humorous with constant jokes and inuendos. Death Note instead relies on psychological tension to carry itself and by doing so breaks away from the many cliches that surround anime in general. The story makes you think and it refuses to make things easy. It makes you think so much that you can't help but wonder if the character's are just inteligent prodigies or just people who use their inteligence to the maximum. As two brilliant minds from L and Light constantly force each other into tight corners it makes them wonder who's truly the master intellect and if they really can win this battle of wits. <br/><br/>If you can get into this psychological aspect of tension than you will love this anime, but you have to have the inteligence to follow it or else it doesn't make much sense, meaning this show unfortunately isn't for everybody. Despite this it goes above and beyond in being suspenseful and it is one of the best anime's you can see. First review ever... I just had to say something! This is one of the best Anime shows. It is a cerebral, psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat! This is a must see, although everything else you watch after this will seem lackluster.<br/><br/>Some of my favorites are Naruto, Cowboy Bebop, Bleach, Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit, Mushishi and Black Butler.<br/><br/>Death note trumps all because of the genius of the plot. I usually recommend subs, but the dubbed version is soooo good. The character voices are genius. Light, the protagonist, is such an intriguing character! You want to relate to him, even the bit of evil he contains. In the end, it's just doomed haha. I'm not an anime fan at all, simply because I've never given it much chance but also because the few times I have, it's just not for me. But a friend heavily pushed me to see this, and I'm glad I did. It's an anime TV show that I could see having influence on many of the dramas going on right now (Breaking Bad perhaps as one of them). I saw the dubbed version, but the voice acting was pretty spectacular. It hits some rough spots, the second half or so (after the first 15 or so episodes) isn't as great as the first half, but the final two episodes are magnificent and end the series on a very high note. This is definitely recommended, it's full of extremely moral dilemmas. Death Note is quite possibly my favourite anime and manga to date. The characters are all developed beautifully with a lot of thought, from the contrast and similarities between Yagami Light and L, to the cat-and-mouse game that they seem to be caught in. Even minor characters like Matsuda, Sayu and Soichiro Yagami have their own personality traits that are made very clear. It allows you to form your own opinions and question everyone's morals and motives. The animation was beautiful (Light eating a potato chip made the anime and I'm not exaggerating). I have seen the anime twice and read the manga, but haven't seen the live-action film as of yet. I would recommend this to anyone, whether they are a fan of anime or not. 10/10 every time. this is very clever anime. It is also fluent.<br/><br/>while I was watching I found my self in brain storm.<br/><br/>I'm having so much fun.<br/><br/>It has got a very fantastic and complicated story.<br/><br/>I like it. I really wonder the end.episodes was written facilely.<br/><br/>one episodes is just 20 minutes. so it doesn't take so much time.<br/><br/>the characters are so smart in the anime.my favorite character is Laito.<br/><br/>Laito is the main character I think anime of fantastic fun for movie lovers.<br/><br/>the anime looks like cartoons so more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I think you should watch it really loved the way which the characters in the movie are designed. the intelligence involved in the filmmakers mind quite complex and simply brilliant. definitely one of the best i have ever watched in my life. I you like suspense and thrillers no doubt that, you will love this course. worth spending your time any number of times to watch this. the movie goes on like l's techniques to trace out Kira and corresponding moves by Kira to miss lead L, the taught process of thinking beyond the possibilities reminds me of a chess game. thoroughly a mind capturing movie which comes in the list of very rare movies like which we cannot stop thinking of the story and intelligence involved in it for a long time. 'I may appear to be loosing at every instance, but in the end I will win' best ever dialog i could never forget. "The human whose name is written in this note shall die."<br/><br/>Light believes that the world is rotten, and so vows to create a world without evil, using his 'Death Note'. The mood of the series is dark, and it follows the chilling battle of wits between Light, and a detective known only as 'L'. The sheer brilliance of both characters creates a mind game that will have you shaking with excitement as strategies and plans unfold.<br/><br/>The show also challenges ideals/moral values and you'll have to think hard about your idea of justice as you pick a side- or are unable to.<br/><br/>The only negative I can think of is that it felt forced after around 3/4 of the way through, but don't let that stop you from watching- it truly is an incredible series.<br/><br/>Notes: Watch with subtitles- the English voice acting simply isn't as good as the original Japanese.<br/><br/>It's very important to watch the first 2 episodes. I can almost guarantee you'll be hooked.<br/><br/>*The Verdict* Death Note is a dark psychological thriller and you will enjoy watching characters make impossible deductions and work their way out of impossible situations. By far one of my favorite series, I absolutely recommend Death Note as a must see.
