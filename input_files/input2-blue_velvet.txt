In the early moments of "Blue Velvet" we see idealized small town images - blooming red roses and immaculate white picket fences - accompanied by the sounds of the gentle Bobby Vinton pop tune that gives the film its title. If you sense something unsettling about this perfection, that's only appropriate. "Blue Velvet" is a David Lynch film, you see, and it won't be long at all before a clean-cut college student comes across a rotting ear in an open field.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is the boy who finds the ear, and Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) is the blonde policeman's daughter who assists Jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery. Sandy and Jeffrey link the ear to night club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and later, a deranged man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>"I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert," Sandy tells Jeffrey when he decides to sneak into Dorothy's apartment. As Jeffrey becomes sexually entangled with Dorothy, we can only cast similar doubt.<br/><br/>It's true that "Blue Velvet"'s dark mysteries have the power to repulse. Voyeurism, rape, torture, and murder are all key to the plot. Yet the film is also spellbinding in its beauty. Vibrant colors and ominous shadows offer gorgeous contrast - call it Technicolor noir - and the film is rife with unforgettable imagery. Moments big and small, from MacLachlan playing with a child's birthday hat to Dean Stockwell's show-stopping lip-synch of Roy Orbison's "In Dreams", are as haunting as anything you will see at the movies anywhere.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch. MacLachlan is just right as the lost innocent Jeffrey, and Hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint Frank. Rossellini's performance as Dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous: this is her defining moment as an actress.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is perhaps the quintesstential David Lynch film. His strange humor and painterly gift for creating stunning images are prominently on display, and the film illustrates Lynch's contradictory impulses toward unbridled nastiness and aw-shucks sweetness like no other has. After all these years, "Blue Velvet" is still a shocker, and deciding how one feels about it is still a challenge. It is a film to be considered and then reconsidered, visited and revisited, the kind of film that will never fade away. For serious cinephiles, then, "Blue Velvet" is a film to be cherished. A very strange movie but incredible. A young man (Kyle MacLaclan) comes home to help care for his sick father. Soon he's in love with a detective's daughter (Laura Dern) and mixed up in a mystery involving Dorothy Valdes (Isabella Rossellinni) and psycho Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>Probably David Lynch's best film. The story has gaps in logic, but it's secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery (this has to be seen letter-boxed...no two ways about it). Lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie. You can tell...things that make no sense at first gradually make sense later on. This movie also demands multiple viewings...I was so shocked the first time I saw it, I couldn't concentrate on it...it took THREE viewings to finally get it. <br/><br/>As to what the movie is about...it depends who you ask. Some people said it's the Hardy Boys on drugs...others say it's about a boy's sexual awakening...others see it as good vs. evil...each one is a valid statement! To me, that's a true art film...one that means multiple things all at once.<br/><br/>The performances are top-notch. This film made MacLachlan...him and Laura Dern work well together and give nice low-key performances. Dern is just great...but she does look pretty silly when she tries to cry. Rossellinni is nowhere near as good as her mother (Ingrid Bergman) was, but she deserves credit for taking such a risky role. She's pretty good. Hopper is WAYYYYYYY over the top as Booth...he's both horrifying and hilarious...a great performance. And let's not forget Dean Stockwell as "suave Ben". His "performance" of "In Dreams" is a definite highlight.<br/><br/>Be warned--the film is very extreme. There's explicit violence, plenty of nudity, sex and tons of profanity. Not for the squeamish. Still, I loved it from beginning to end. One of my favorite films of all time. This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.<br/><br/>This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: "Frank Booth," played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, "Dorothy Vallens," played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy late-teen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.<br/><br/>In a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them - and there are a number - is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lip-synching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the f-word in about every sentence. He is so over-the-top, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts. <br/><br/>Visually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects). <br/><br/>From discussions I've had, this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much "nicer" films such as "The Straight Story," crazier films ("Wild At Heart," "Eraserhead") and classier movies ("The Elephant Man") but this will be his trademark film: the one above others he will be remembered for, good or bad. Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his small town home when his father has an accident and ends up in hospital.  A quiet walk home changes his perceptions forever when he discovers a human ear in the long grass.  He reports it to the police but decides to make some enquires himself with the help of the officer's daughter Sandy.  The trail begins with the mysterious Dorothy Vallens and drags Jeffrey into the unseen underworld of Frank Booth.<br/><br/>For the majority of people, you either like Lynch or you dislike him. Personally I like the majority of his work, I love the sense of normalcy that he can create and slowly change to reveal a darkness that is worryingly close to the surface.  That is the case here, beginning with a blue sky, white picket fence vision of small town America the camera drops into the grass to see a torrent of bugs scrambling just under the surface.  In the same way the film follows Jeffrey's journey into the underbelly of his home town.<br/><br/>In some ways this is one of the easiest Lynch films to get into  here the darkness is not a wide world of demons as in Fire Walk With Me, but is one man and his associates who can be overcome.  The darkness is therefore accessible to all but is laced with just enough weirdness to disturb  my favourite scene is where Frank takes Jeffrey to see Ben, it is just a little unsettling.  In hand with this is the fact that it is easily one of his most optimistic films, the good angel in Jeffrey's life is a strong character and the ending is one of certainty rather than open to interpretation  that robin has about a clear a meaning as it can.<br/><br/>MacLachlan is well used as Jeffrey.  He is wide eyed and innocent even when being sucked into the underworld.  Dern plays `all-American' well but doesn't have the complexity of MacLachlan in the script.  Rossellini has a challenging role and carries it off quite well  I didn't fully understand her character but I don't know if that was my fault or hers.  Of course the film belongs to Hopper who is terrifyingly unstable.  Without a doubt he is a monster and you never are left in any doubt as to his state of mind.  For an example of his work here watch the scene where Stockwell (in a wonderfully weird cameo) sings and Hopper clearly falls to pieces.<br/><br/>Although I prefer Fire Walk With Me, I do think that this is Lynch's best film.  It is weird without going totally overboard and it allows us to sink into the underworld gradually without sudden falls.  Hopper controls every scene he is in, but the meeting of wholesome and weird is perfectly delivered and is trademark Lynch. Title: Blue Velvet (1986)<br/><br/>Director: David Lynch <br/><br/>Cast: Isabella Rosellini, Kyle Mac Lachlan, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern <br/><br/>Review: David Lynch films are paintings come to life, this has very much to do with the fact that Lynch himself is a painter and he brings that artistic point of view to his film making. Like a good painting, his movies tell a story, which much like an abstract painting, is not always easy to figure out. But what a treat it is to try.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a story about a young man returning to his hometown to visit his father who is sick in the hospital. Upon his return he stumbles upon a frightening discovery: a human ear lying on the grass as he walks through the forest behind his parents home. He then takes it upon himself to discover where this ear came from and discovers that that ear will be the reason why he discovers that this is in fact a very strange and dangerous world in which we live in.<br/><br/>Lynch is synonymous with the strange and unusual and Blue Velvet is a good example of this. For those who have ventured into Lynchian territory with films like Mullholland Dr. or Lost Highway get ready for some more crazy imagery and messed up situations. But Ill be honest this time around, even though the situations and images are very very surreal and strange the story itself is pretty easy to understand. Lost Highway remains a total mystery to me to this day, Mullholland Dr. I had to watch about 6 times to figure out....but Blue Velvet though equally as strange and fascinating as those films mentioned, is actually easy to follow and understand.<br/><br/>I loved Kyle MacLachlans character and it was very interesting to see him go through the changes he goes through after he makes his discoveries. He isn't quite the same anymore after he sees the things he sees and does the things he does. Loved that scene in which Laura Dern tries to let him see that even though there's some crazy things in this world there's some good bound to show up sooner or later. Laura Derns character was beautiful and innocent, the one thing that could bring balance to MacLachlans character. By far the most interesting and memorable thing in this film is Dennis Hoppers character, yes my friends, I'm talking about that crazy, demented, sex-crazed freak known as Frank Booth.<br/><br/>Frank Booth is one of those characters that just oozes with evil. You don't feel like its this actor playing some villain, when that happens you totally stop believing that said villain is dangerous. Not so here. Hopper looks, breaths and speaks pure evil! Your kind of scared that there might actually be people like him out in the real world. His scenes and dialog is truly disturbing stuff....."Ill f##C@ anything that moooves!" <br/><br/>I loved the visual aspect of the film which was -as is usual in a Lynch film- extremely beautiful. We may be looking at sliced human ears and demented sex freaks...but everything is photographed within the context of beautiful haunting colors, exotic plays of shadows and lights. Great visuals. The music is incredible as well. Lynch seems to be fond of lounge singers cause very much like he did in Mullholland Drive in Club Silencio, we get another sequence much like that one, with Isabella Rosellini singing us "Blue Velvet" the title song. And there's also a sequence which is very very humorous yet strange and alluring....Dean Stockwell singing Roy Orbinsons "In Dreams". Awesome sequence, one of the most memorable sequences on this film or any other Lynch film. When that scene comes on, you'll be transported to another time and place. What time and place it is Ill leave it up to you.<br/><br/>All in all a great Lynch film not to be missed. A masterpiece that lets me know why Lynch is one of the greatest American directors ever to be in the business of making bizarro, beautiful cinema.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 out of 5 (and very very much so!) There is far more to 'Blue Velvet' than meets the eye.  You can't label this as drama, satire, or black comedy.  It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>'Blue Velvet' is an example of our world's disarray.  This film is VERY genius in its portrayal.  We see a hokey, innocent town that yields a dark secret.<br/><br/>The symbolism is great.  White picket fences, waving fireman, hokey acting, and a sunny day show the apparent innocence.  But a stroke, black insects, a candle getting blown out, etc. show us something else.<br/><br/>I love how when we see the innocence, everything is hokey.  The music, acting, dialogue... everything.  But when the darkness appears, everything becomes serious.  The script improves, the acting is better... everything. That's something that was missed by most viewers.<br/><br/>David Lynch is brilliant, but he also has a great sense of humor.  Jokes aren't funny... absurdity is funny.<br/><br/>Lightness and darkness seemingly coexist in this lumber town... each in their own place.  When a curious fellow returns home, he disrupts the balance and the two forces go to war.  Yet, we don't really even know which side he's on.  I love how Jeffrey always wears black and white.  I love all the symbology of this film.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this yet, break away from the Hollywood cookie cutter movies and prepare to have your mind challenged and entertained.<br/><br/>Makes a fun party movie, too.   ;o)<br/><br/>10/10 What surprised me was how very different this was from the two other great David Lynch films I'd seen: "Lost Highway" and "The Straight Story", which are in turn very different from one another. I'd been told by a disappointed David Lynch fan, back in 1997, that the only reason I was so deeply impressed with "Lost Highway" was that I hadn't seen "Bue Velvet", in which he does much the same kind of thing better. "Blue Velvet" may indeed be better (I wouldn't want to say), but in no respect is it the same kind of thing. (The only instance I've encountered so far of Lynch making the same film twice is "Lost Highway" being remade as "Mulholland Drive", which partly accounts for the latter film being so stale and uninvolving.)<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is a simple amateur sleuthing story, but the genius is in the telling of it. It's hard to avoid the feeling that something supernatural is somehow involved, although it isn't, and we know that it isn't. It looks and feels as though we're watching the world through a special enchanted (or cursed) prism: the image has been pulled apart, ALMOST into two distinct images, with the elements of pure evil and pure wholesomeness now distinct from one another, sitting just millimetres apart.<br/><br/>Unrelated to this, but still contributing to the intense suspense and the overall creepiness, is Lynch's ability to make us familiar with a few ordinary locations, which grow more sinister - or at least more meaningful - every time we see them, until the sight of a simple concrete stairwell in the dark is enough to make us start to panic. To watch Blue Velvet for the first time 31 years after its original release is a treat of unexpected proportions. I'm not going to tell about the story because, I'm sure, each one of us could tell it in very different ways. The blandness of Kyle MacLachland here is a major plus. It's not him that rivet us but his circumstances. And the circumstances are truly riveting, terrifying, unpredictable and gloriously cinematic. Dennis Hopper is superb, disgustingly so and Isabella Rossellini creates a character that was totally new to me. Related to many others but new, disturbingly so. Dean Stockwell has a moment that I know already will stay in my mind for ever. I'm so glad I finally saw it. The sexual revolution in film came some ten years after the label's coinage in the late Sixties. It probably began with Last Tango in Paris. Directed by the acclaimed Bernardo Bertolucci, Last Tango is notorious for a sex scene involving Marlon and roughly a third of a stick of butter. Theretofore sex in film could potentially be used as a means of revealing the lightest or the darkest character's traits: primarily, vulnerability, instinct, sadism and impulse. Blue Velvet is a good example of a movie using such a dynamic. Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated. Likewise, it is not a film that is easily forgotten. It is a timeless controversy, and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise. <br/><br/>Set in a small American town, Blue Velvet is a dark, sensuous mystery involving the intertwining lives of four very different individuals. The film's painful realism reminds us that we are not immune to the disturbing events which transpire in Blue Velvet's sleepy community. There is a darker side of life waiting for us all. And as a critic said 'you either think it's dementedly wild at heart or a lost highway to nowhere'. Even some eighteen years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime, but none as dangerously imposing as this. Why is that so? <br/><br/>If Blue Velvet might not be labeled as a masterpiece one has to acknowledge that there are in this movie a lot of so called 'masterpiece element' and if Blue Velvet will never be considered as Mr. Lynch best feature, I personally can see a lot of David Lynch's genius flowing in that movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the way David Lynch makes Blue Velvet increasingly disturbing is a perfect example of how pristine the dynamics of weirdness and tension are built (remember Eraserhead and Elephant Man). Through this process Mr. Lynch indeed deconstructs the audience expectations. The film setting and mood are introduced in an exposition lifted directly from older films (there are numerous references to It's A Wonderful Life). In result the film is initially expected to follow a particular path. The way Mr. Lynch associate elements of classic narrative methodology and 'his dynamics of noir' (previously explained) appears to be original at worst 'avant gardiste' at best. <br/><br/>Second of all, the opposition between the creepiness of the plot and the setting of it is definitely for me a masterpiece element. The film is set in Lumberton. This does not represent a quaint, small town by similarity; it is one. Lumberton is filled with characters that are completely typical. I can almost see the cops eating doughnuts in the coffee shop and the local football star dating the head cheerleader. This typicality is definitely not out of coincidence but of intention. In fact these characters function to punctuate the story, not to distinguish it. The 'infamous' individuality of Lynch's vision is established in the darker side of Lumberton. Our perspective throughout the film is fixed on Jeffery, and is deliberately biased by his good nature. Jeffery is portrayed with great subtlety by Kyle MacLachlan (FBI agent from "Twin Peaks"). He is paired with Sandy (Laura Dern), the daughter of a neighborhood investigator who epitomizes to perfection the 'girl-next-door'; in Blue Velvet it is her literal function. Completing this diverse list of roles is a haunting and brief performance by Dean Stockwell as well as Dennis Hopper who creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentant and irredeemable evil. The confrontation or those characters or the collision among themselves makes for a mesmerizing experience. <br/><br/>Once again Mr. Lynch succeeds in the masterful exercise of controlling the audience's attention. Most of us will not quite know what to make of it and we can disagree on the value of such a cinematic experience. However audacious, erotic, disturbing, haunting are adjectives that will always be linked with Blue Velvet. The 'Thriller' has just been re-invented by Mr. Lynch right in front of our eyes. I just want to say that I fell in love with this film after seeing the 25th anniversary edition blu ray. It looks beautiful. Having only seen it in the early 90s on a run-of-the-mill videotape that was probably pan and scan and full of color and toning problems, it truly is a different experience on blu ray.<br/><br/>The brutally honest performances, visionary aesthetic and the beautiful style make Blue Velvet an absolutely unmissable film and a wonderful addition to Blu Ray. Despite the films fame and notoriety, all these years later, the film still seems completely original, invigorating and unsurpassed. <br/><br/>Everyone assumes that Blue Velvet opens with the infamous ear-in-the-grass scene, but the film's opening is even more disturbing than that. A suburban fantasia of white picket fences, blood-red roses, waving fireman, happy children and a man watering his lawn gives way to the disturbing moment when the watering man collapses and the camera pans down to dirt level where a number of horrific insects are scrabbling in the dirt at the base of the lawn. The soundtrack changes from Leave It to Beaver-style music to the loud, gnawing, electric saw-like noises emitted by the creatures. Only subsequent to this scene does Jeffrey Beaumont (a wide-eyed, snoopy Kyle MacLachlan) find the ear in a field of overgrown weeds. <br/><br/>The ear leads Jeffrey through a sordid underworld involving kidnapping, masochism, drug- dealing, and murder. But while there's a whole lot of plot in Blue Velvet, Lynch's more elemental concern is with unearthing the truth behind the facade (i.e. showing what lurks under the lawn). Even the blue velvet dress that chanteuse Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rossellini) wears hides a secret — namely, the bruises on her body which are delivered by the vile Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper, in the role that brought him back to the limelight). <br/><br/>When Jeffrey asks the naive Sandy (Laura Dern), the prim girl on whom he has a crush, why there is so much trouble in the world, the answer is clear — without it, our lives would be far duller. Jeffrey himself admits that he loves a mystery and the curiosity that his desire entails is the same one that fuels Lynch's own vision. When Frank says to Jeffrey, "You're like me," it could be Lynch speaking to the audience. We want to know more, even if what we find out hurts or is ugly. Like the scene of an accident, we cannot look away. <br/><br/>Fueled by a vibrant and always-surprising dream like surrealism, Blue Velvet reminds us that the dreams and fantasies of our subconscious are dangerous and thrilling; it's surface reality that is superficial and mundane. <br/><br/>This is definitely a film worth watching multiple times. It gets better and better on every viewing. There are so many questions, and at the same time, so many answers, which seem to bring up more questions. Blue Velvet is a timeless film and it looks absolutely superb on Blu Ray. I will happily get lost in this film from time and time again, it's absolutely remarkable. 10/10 Back in the days when David Lynch's movies used to be coherent, this film proves to be one of the most powerful in a long line of odd and strange films. I felt all of the actors were exceptional in this film, reflecting the power and evil in Dennis Hopper's character. I can't see anyone else in this role, and Hopper proved once again he is the go-to guy when it comes to portraying a lunatic. Lynch's cinematography and artistic endeavors fit in so perfectly with each other, the film reeks of noir and suspense. An excellent film to watch for any first time Lynch watchers. With Blue Velvet, David Lynch made a film that was so pure to his original vision that it would become the archetype of his work for the next fifteen years.  Here, Lynch cast his ever probing, surrealist gaze upon small town middle America, and for the first time in a US film, showed the audience the darker side to what was often depicted as nothing more than the birth place of apple pie. We are drawn into the story almost immediately, with what would seem like a simple depiction of small town life, but the use of slow-motion hints that there is something not quite right with what we are looking at.  So by the time Lynch has pushed his camera through the soft green grass of a regular front lawn, only to show us the slithering insects that hide in the darkness, we know that we are about to enter a very dark world.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a world filled with not only darkness, but also ambiguity. The characters of this world are constantly hiding behind some kind of façade, be it the wardrobe doors that practicing teenage voyeur Jeffrey peers from behind as he watches Dorothy and Frank interact, or something as simple as the make-up worn by Ben.  Everything suggests to us that these characters inhabit a world at night, a world away from the life they live in the day.  As the film moves closer and closer to the climax Jeffrey begins to feel more of a connection with Frank, having to go to some very dark places within his psyche.  However Lynch's message, that underneath the normal persona of a regular human being is a repressed pervert laying in wait, or whatever point he is making doesn't really translate well.  Not least to today's audience.  <br/><br/>Blue Velvet is very much a film of its time, that time being the mid-eighties, with aids paranoia everywhere, it's easy to see this metaphor for the dangers of sex and love within the films turgid dreamscapes.  But beneath this message hides a strong detective story, a modern day neo-noir that delivers interesting twists and a controversial pay-off with it's almost fairytale climax.  This is the film David Lynch got right, proceeding to make great films that where all personal, but completely different in terms of style and substance from one another.  Blue Velvet is a great film, with some fine (albeit bizarre) performances, still challenging to this day, If only Lynch hadn't gone on to spend the rest of his career re-making it. One has to watch a David Lynch movie just to say you have seen one. This was actually nominated for an Academy Award and won many others, so it is probably as good as any to see. I tried Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, but couldn't get more than a couple of scenes before I gave up. I was able to hang in there for this.<br/><br/>There has to be something there, but I just don't get it. The man has four Academy Award nominations for his films. He must be doing something that I just don't see.<br/><br/>Closeups of bugs in the grass or the inside of an ear is not stirring cinematography to me.<br/><br/>An example of the dialog you have to endure in this film:<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan): You're a neat girl. Sandy Williams (Laura Dern): So are you... I mean, you're a neat guy.<br/><br/>This wasn't random, but typical. And, what's with the "chicken walk"?<br/><br/>Maybe some think it is worth enduring to see Isabella Rossellini nude walking like a zombie.<br/><br/>I was worth enduring just to know what a David Lynch film is like, and to avoid them in the future. David Lynch is a very love-him-hate-him director, with people fascinated by his style and imagery and others who find his films not easy to follow and too weird for their tastes. As somebody who loves Lynch and a lot of his films(the only one I've disliked is Dune), Blue Velvet is up there at the top. The Elephant Man(never has there been a film that moved me more) may be my personal favourite but Blue Velvet is quite possibly Lynch's masterpiece. Loved Mulholland Drive as well, but it is not as accessible as Elephant Man or Blue Velvet- films that even those who aren't fans of Lynch are likely to love- and is his most polarising most likely.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an incredible-looking film. All of Lynch's films are beautifully shot and that is true of Blue Velvet as well, and the imagery is both hauntingly surreal and beautiful, all the different colours really popping out at you. The music is hypnotic with a very haunting undercurrent and really adds to the story's strangeness and mystery elements. The script is thoughtful and cohesive with a dose of weird but subtle humour as well as some deliberately not so subtle parts(especially with villain Frank Booth). The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story- one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film- is always interesting and entertaining, the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary, Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.<br/><br/>Lynch's direction is superb; along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written, in the case of Frank Booth, one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films, iconic. The acting is superb as well, especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious, he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here, he's certainly not had a character as interesting either, Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well. Overall, a strange but utterly mesmerising masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox ...and it isn't because I don't get or appreciate surrealism or because I missed the element of satire. I 'got it' alright. I just don't want it.<br/><br/>The story begins when naive college boy finds a human ear in a grown-over abandoned lot near his father's home, puts it in a bag, and takes it to the police station, where his discovery is greeted with a diffident, "Yup, that's a human ear alright." A conversation with the town sheriff's teenage daughter reveals that it might have something to do with a mysterious and glamorous lounge singer. So Jeffrey does what anyone would do- break into her apartment and spy on her, of course. And finding him hiding in her closet, listening to her phone conversations and watch her undress, the lounge singer, Dorothy, does what any woman would do under the circumstances- give him oral sex, of course! It practically goes without saying! The two of them embark on a lopsided affair that never fully blossoms, while Jeffrey woos sweet teenage Sandy on the side. Meanwhile, wrapped up in unstable Dorothy's sexual psychodrama, Jeffrey plays some cross between detective and knight and shining armor to a damsel in distress, and revels in Dorothy's co-dependent clinging, all the while knowing that this affair could get him killed.<br/><br/>Dorothy's lover/stalker/tormentor is a ragingly nuts, repulsively perverted mafia a-hole named Frank, in the most disgustingly creepy role in Dennis Hopper's proud legacy of playing scary, nutbag freaks. Frank's infantile-yet-violent, jack rabbit dry-humping perversion, not to mention his obliviousness to how obnoxious and repugnant it is, is enough to make you never want to have sex again. Yet, Frank and Dorothy are both quite obviously insane- what's Jeffrey's excuse for his bizarre, irrational choices? The fact that he is apparently sane and fairly intelligent makes it all the more annoying. Every single character in the film is so annoying to me that I want to smack 'em upside the head, but the two women in the story are just plain pitiful.<br/><br/>Sandy and Dorothy are sort of a Betty and Veronica/rose white-rose red case. Dorothy is an older, glamorous, beautiful brunette, while Sandy is a younger, pretty, virginal blonde. Sandy is the least stupid and irritating character in the beginning, but I lost patience with her after she immediately forgave Jeffrey for his affair with Dorothy with very little explanation or effort from Jeffrey, then continually pins the blame on herself for "dragging him into this" when the situation is quite the opposite. Sandy puts herself in harm's way for Jeffrey even though he has lied to her, and at the close of the film is in the kitchen happily making him lunch while he lounges around in the back yard. For his part, Jeffrey just seems like a melodramatic sap who's "in love" with whoever's there at the moment. You really can't tell if his feelings for either Dorothy or Sandy have any depth to them.<br/><br/>What really works my nerves, though, is the woefully corny dialog, with absurdly over-earnest lines like, "Why is there so much trouble in the world?!?!" and "You're my special friend!" Not to mention, "I looked for you in the closet last night." Granted, all these lines are kinda funny, but are they supposed to be? And who's the joke on, the characters or the viewer. Either way, if it weren't for my roommate being there to mock it with me, I would have turned this movie off about 15 minutes into it.<br/><br/>How movies like this gain backing, let alone a cult following, I'll never know. But when it comes to satirizing suburbia, though, give me John Waters any day. After hearing all the hype of how this is an artistic, intellectual & enigmatic film, I figured I would love it to death. Instead, I found myself *wishing* for death.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert got it right when he called it "a story that's marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots. The director is either denying the strength of his material or trying to defuse it by pretending it's all part of a campy in-joke."<br/><br/>It begins impressively with excellent cinematic technique and symbolism, but as soon as the first words are spoken, the film begins to sag with ridiculous, predictable and juvenile dialogue. The plot itself is tediously linear and simple, like an average Hardy Boys episode: high school kids take on the criminal underworld!<br/><br/>But, oh, this is no Hardy Boys episode. Director David Lynch made sure of that, by injecting plenty of profanity, gore, and nudity. (And just as an aside to all you drooling fans of Isabella Rosselini... TRUST me, she & her beer-belly look awful in this movie! Save yourselves the shattered fantasies.)<br/><br/>The scenes are extremely clumsy and overt, as if Lynch doesn't give us enough credit for figuring it out ourselves. I'll give you one example: In one scene, Laura Dern and Dune Boy (forgot his name) are sitting in a car in front of a church. Laura starts talking about her dream of God. The music switches to a church pipe organ. Then they drive off, and the camera zooms in on the church and holds the frame for 3 full seconds. (...hmmm, d'ya git the feelin he's a-trying to tell us sumthin? I dunno, Vern. Lez rewind it and watch it again.)<br/><br/>True, compared to the Hollywood tripe that was the standard in 1986, _Blue Velvet_ is unique. But that doesn't mean it's good. I would advise you to watch Lynch's 1990 film _Wild at Heart_ in which he achieved a greater degree poetry, having refined his style somewhat. Well, you have been warned! Usually, before watching any movie I look up IMDb to see its rating and viewers' comments on it. I did the same before seeing the Blue Velvet. It said, mostly, that the film is extremely violent and highly disturbing, yet still a masterpiece, and it had a reasonably high rating of 7.8/10...then I watched the movie. I believe it is one of the most disgusting films I ever saw. It is no doubt intended to be full of hidden significance, or symbolism and the violence and sex seems to only be there to exploit characters. This is supposed to be "new and frighteningly surrealistic", a "a satire on suburbia", a "glimpse of the underworld". The viewer is probably supposed to be saturated with disgust to the point that he/she realizes, oh my God, that's us! Suppose, however, that you don't go along with this idea. What do you see then? You see an empty film. It is filled with meaningless nudity, violence and bizarre sex and your suppose to swallow it all and call it an artistic masterpiece.<br/><br/>I'm perplexed at how this is now a classic movie. Pfft! Welcome to the idyllic town of Lumberton, where life seems beautiful all the time. Of course, BLUE VELVET is a film by David Lynch, so, nothing is quite as it appears to be! Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle Maclachlan) returns to Lumberton from college, to see his ailing father. While walking one day, he makes a gruesome discovery that will alter his life forever. Jeffrey doesn't know it, but he's about to take a dark journey into a secret underworld. An alternate reality, right in his own hometown! Unable to contain his curiosity, Jeffrey soon looks into a mystery involving what he found. Enter Sandy Williams (Laura Dern- WILD AT HEART, INLAND EMPIRE), who joins Jeffrey in his investigation. When Jeffrey delves into the life of a woman named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), he is swept up into something unexpectedly twisted, and extremely dangerous. From here, the abyss opens, and Jeffrey sees his town in a whole new... light. As he would again in TWIN PEAKS, Lynch allows the hidden madness to bleed through the veneer of the innocent and the quaint. BV is film noir, David Lynch style, w/ all of his quirky weirdness on display. Dennis Hopper plays the truly malevolent Frank Booth w/ insane, criminal glee. He and his band of merry thugs (including: Brad Dourif and Jack Nance!) show Jeffrey a night he'll never forget. That is, if he survives! Ms. Dern shines bright, playing the movie's source of light, in contrast to Ms. Rossalini's darker, masochistic femme fatale. This movie is a perfect, more linear starting point for those who might be new to Lynch's movies... Blue Velvet(1986) is a terminally weird David Lynch entry about a young mans(Kyle MacLachlan) involvement into the world of bizarre people after finding a severed ear in a vacant lot. Lynch pulls out all the stops here in a brutal, disturbing film that is almost impossible to enjoy. Dennis Hopper deserved all the rave reviews he got for his role as the chief nut case Frank Booth, however, Dean Stockwells 'Suave' Ben has to be seen to be believed.Filmed in North Carolina. It has its good points. When Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) sings the title song in the club, the film exudes wonderful atmosphere. Other oldies-but-goodies songs also are enjoyable to listen to. And the film's color cinematography, with its vibrant hues, is quite effective. Otherwise, this film is just awful.<br/><br/>Set in small town America in the early 1960s, the film opens with a young man named Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) who finds a human ear, while strolling through the woods one day. Jeffrey's curiosity propels the plot through a convoluted story involving strange characters, sex, drugs, and murder. It's all rather seedy. And the film's excessive violence is annoying.<br/><br/>The story's inciting incident is not remotely plausible. The plot makes no sense. Some of the dialogue is sophomoric. And the characters are dreadful. The Frank Booth character (Dennis Hopper) is so outlandish as to be cartoonish. His use of an oxygen mask is nothing but a gimmick. Hopper makes matters worse by overplaying the role. The Ben character (Dean Stockwell) is bizarre, and not in a good way. And Dorothy is an emotional wreck, whiny and easily manipulated.<br/><br/>The film's casting and acting are wretched. Kyle MacLachlan is as bad in this film as he was in "Dune" (1984). He's bland, lacks suitable expressiveness, and is annoyingly nerdy. If he were any stiffer, he could pass for a mannequin. I don't know who was worse: dull MacLachlan or farcical Dennis Hopper. Rossellini tries to act, but her performance comes across as comically melodramatic which, when combined with Hopper's histrionics, renders scenes that are unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>The film's moody atmosphere makes for suitable cinematic style. But the script, the direction, the casting, and the acting are so bad that the end result is a cartoon for spaced-out adults. And the emphasis on gratuitous violence suggests that Director David Lynch was making an effort to distract viewers from the film's hokey contrivances. I'd say he succeeded rather well. I have a lot of respect for David Lynch. The man gets a lot of flack for being "too weird," but I don't know when that became a derogatory comment. Weird, in the film industry, often translates to originality. Blue Velvet is not at all lacking in originality. This isn't your typical mystery-thriller. In fact, its genre is a bit hard to define. It has moments of dramatic intensity, as well as scenes that contain biting humorous undertones. It's safe to say this was controversial in the 80s, as it still holds a bit of shock factor in retrospect. Blue Velvet is an accomplishment of a lifetime. Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead are often referred to as Lynch's masterpieces, but to me, Blue Velvet defines Lynch's career.<br/><br/>In one of the best openings I've ever seen, Blue Velvet begins by showing us a typical suburban neighborhood: white picket fences, beautiful gardens, nice houses. Immediately following, we're shown what's below the surface: the ground is being overtaken by bugs that resemble cockroaches. This simple scene foreshadows the rest of the film. What we're shown here is a simple little town, seemingly happy on the outside. However, when you probe below the surface of anything good, you may find something you didn't expect.<br/><br/>After his father collapses with what I assume was a heart attack, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns to Lumberton from college. Jeffrey is your typical young man: he's a nice kid, fairly naïve. As he walks through an empty field, he finds something strange. On the ground, he discovers a severed human ear. He brings it into a detective he is familiar with. The detective is the father of Sandy (Laura Dern), a high school senior who Jeffrey knew from school. The two of them are curious about the ear. After overhearing her father's discussion with a coworker, Sandy informs Jeffrey that the investigation led them to a woman named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini). Jeffrey and Sandy search further and eventually find out where Dorothy's apartment is located. Sandy is unsure, but Jeffrey is determined to crack the case. At his insistence, Sandy helps Jeffrey devise a plan to break into Dorothy's apartment. What they didn't expect was for Jeffrey to find himself locked in Dorothy's closet in a scene that has been given countless homage. This is where Jeffrey uncovers more information: Dorothy is being controlled, mentally and sexually, by a sadistic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who has kidnapped her husband and child.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper's entrance into Blue Velvet is intense and his character is among the most terrifying in film history. This is where the entire mood of the film changes. No longer is this a simple detective story about two kids trying to crack a case. As Jeffrey watches Frank's power over Dorothy, he becomes sucked in. Eventually, he becomes personally involved with the two. Insanity ensues. As Jeffrey's world view changes, his actions become more and more like Frank's. This transformation is well conceived and believable.<br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned, Blue Velvet contains some top notch performances, mostly by actors who never really got their due. Kyle MacLachlan is perfect as Jeffrey. He has that golden boy look that makes his innocent naivety believable, but he's not too square that his transformation is not believable. I truly believe that Kyle was gypped out of a great career. With this, Twin Peaks, and The Hidden, the man should have ended up with better. Either way, this is a career defining performance, one that any actor should be proud of. Isabella Rossellini is just as good. It's truly impossible to not feel anything for this character: a woman whose life is truly out of her hands. The movie wouldn't have been what it was without Dennis Hopper, whose perfect portrayal of Frank Booth is like evil personified. He's wonderful in this role: truly someone to be afraid of, but with some lines that are strangely amusing. Laura Dern is very believable as innocent, young Sandy. She adds a little something to the film, showing the contrast between true innocence and depravity.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about Blue Velvet is, as I mentioned before, the genre bending. Although I'd call this a drama above all, it is impossible to ignore the comedy. Among the funniest scene is near the beginning, when Jeffrey brings the ear to the detective, at which point the detective proclaims, "Yep, that's a human ear all right." Equally funny is the background radio announcer, "Logs, logs, logs. It's 1:30 as the tree falls here in Lumberton." David Lynch's strange sense of humor is another reason why this film is what it is. There are elements of a thriller. Frank is a terrifying character; he's a person whose actions are impossible to predict. The majority of the violence occurs off screen, but this does not make it any less intense. Blue Velvet also, strangely, has elements of romance. It is, like most Lynch films, impossible to place into one distinct category.<br/><br/>I have few problems with this film. The only thing I can really complain about is the fact that it moved pretty fast, sometimes not allowing for enough characterization before certain events transpire. With a running length of around two hours, Blue Velvet feels a little short. I've read that the original cut was nearly four hours, so it's very likely that a lot was lost in the editing process. I have to wonder if it would have been even more amazing if Lynch had left it in its full, four hour form.<br/><br/>Even with it's few problems, Blue Velvet is an astonishingly beautiful, completely coherent film. Nearly perfect film-making, it is chilling, funny, and bittersweet at the end. Blue Velvet is an enduring film, and one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>10/10, my #7 of all time Okay, the reason I gave one of the most overrated movies of all time 2/10 was purely because of the fact that Dennis Hopper stars, and semi-saves the film from being a total disaster. It is its ONLY redeeming quality. Alright, well the visuals were somewhat impressive. He should be applauded for giving this kind of challenging material a go. I have seen MANY erotic thrillers; none have been as self-serious and pretentious as this. Adding complicated (but meaningless) symbolism into a film does not make it any more complex, let alone save the film from being soft-core porn. You still have the sex, the degrading excessive nudity (especially on poor Isabella Rossellini's behalf). Heck, this has 7.8 (and an arithmetic mean of 7.9), Basic Instinct has a lot in common with this. They are both infamous and well-recognized films thanks to their graphic sex that really don't deserve half the attention they receive. However, Basic Instinct has a more deserving but still disappointingly high rating of 6.8<br/><br/>If your tastes are morose and perverse, Blue Velvet is for you. But don't take it as the classic many people (and to my shock and horror, established critics) make it out as today. This may be unforgettable, but this does not secure the fact that its good. Its unforgettable in a bad way, which is probably why so many people know if it today (very similar to the previously mentioned Basic Instinct). A major waste of talent, time and critical support this is. If you want to see Lynch, see my personal favourite "Lost Highway", "Eraserhead" or view "Twin Peaks". These works are far more intellectually fitting and there sole purpose isn't to shock there viewers. Blue Velvet is a strange one. David Lynch's take on what goes on behind the scenes of suburbia is surprisingly straightforward in terms of plot, but is of course less pleasant than it sounds. It's full of good cinematography, clever ideas, and well-done scenes. Examples include the opening shot that dives beneath the fresh lawn to reveal the darker realm of the insects, and the faux fairytale setting of the conclusion. The characters are well written, with Hopper's performance as Frank the maniac and Isabella Rossellini's turn as Dorothy, the woman on the edge, standing out most.<br/><br/>It does all however beg the question of why. Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) digs beneath the surface of suburbia, perhaps accidentally (finding the ear is a bit random), and while what he finds certainly is bizarre, isn't it weirder to go looking for these things in the first place? While Lynch's take on small-town life shows its audience that people you may know can live lives like these, who really wants to know? <br/><br/>So, Blue Velvet. While the small-town crime story with the unpleasant and far-reaching Oedipal twist may be well done, are you really better off for having seen it? Is this entertainment? It's a "good" film, but I can't really say I enjoyed it. Although I was once inclined to agree with Roger Ebert's dismissal of "Blue Velvet" as a shocking albeit skillful and artistically stylish montage of pointless images, symbolism and effects, I've had to do a 360 turnaround after seeing it on DVD after all this years and reconsidering it in relation to some similar texts. The film certainly makes sense in comparison with a quest narrative such as Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" and in light of Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self. It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably "Vertigo", "Rear Window" and "Psycho," in its preoccupation with spectator psychology and voyeurism.<br/><br/>Basically, Blue Velvet is about the rites of passage of a young man after a descent into the underworld of his home-town. However, the man emerges from his experience neither sadder nor wiser. Instead, Lynch cynically reprises the film's innocent opening with its hopelessly artificial, Pollyannish, post-card pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer. At the same time, he preserves the tenuousness of such a naive vision with the shot of a deliberately artificial insect impaled on a robin's beak and with a soundtrack that subjects the theme song to a disturbing treatment out of some internal, subterranean sound studio.<br/><br/>This film has so many meanings, it would be exhausting to write even half. People, especially the detractors of the film, should give up on saying that there is nothing at the center of the film, and that it is merely pretentious art. Like I said, it has so many meanings that it would take me forever to write even a few with the limited amount of paragraph space I have. Jeffrey, our hero, confronts at first, mortality (his father stricken by a life-threatening stroke), then a severed, decaying human ear in a field. The ear, the organ of hearing, is also the sense that fully awakens only in the dark, granting access to the Dionysian, deep intuitive wellsprings of the self. But the ear we see on screen has become a diseased, useless instrument in a "sunny" culture whose idea of music is Bobby Vinton's version of "Blue Velvet." The ear is Jeffrey's passage into the underworld. Thus, as he sees the ear, before he enters the underworld, the camera zooms into the ear. At the end of the film, when Jeffrey has confronted his demons and been through the ordeal within the underworld, the camera zooms out of the ear to represent what has happened.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is David Lynch's magnum-opus. Dennis Hopper once said that it was America's first surrealist film, however I'd give his earlier, more unknown work "Eraserhead" this title. Blue Velvet is probably, however, the most famous example. I highly recommend this film, whether or not your going to enjoy it is completely out of the question, as long as you see this. It's a life changing experience and a masterpiece. I HATED, HATED, HATED this movie. A friend of mine recommended this movie to me upon discovering I tend to like movies with disturbing content (ex: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, In the Company of Men). I rented it and actually found myself getting angry at how much it disappointed me. Point blank: this movie makes absolutely no sense. Anybody who made sense of this movie or found it artistic is just plain trying too hard to like it just because its Lynch's material.<br/><br/>I found Dennis Hopper's character not at all scary or disturbing - I found him completely silly. I was extremely disappointed because of all the hype I heard about this film. Definitely not worth the time. Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Peter Greenaway wishes he made this film, which is pretty high praise indeed.<br/><br/>And that's the most puzzling thing about `Blue Velvet.' Lynch's talent here is in connecting his imagination directly to the viewer's mind without benefit of structure or coherence -- much in the line of Eisenstein and Tarkovsky.<br/><br/>Greenaway is all about coherence, a particularly intelligent notion of coherence. What Lynch did in `Mulholland Drive' had a novel structure, something missing here. As a result, I consider this much the inferior project. What we have here is the intuitive link, the effect only. The control of style but not yet of narrative. This was a C movie masquerading as a B movie. I think the only reason it passed the film school 'also ran' category is the S&M shock value for 1986.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper was looking for a comeback film, and decided to go the Vincent Price route. He's creepy and scary, but so what? I kept waiting for him to tell me from the screen that a 'tingler' is loose in my couch. <br/><br/>A story can't be built around a few shock scenes. You have to have a cast of characters who can act and a story that has more going for it than waiting to see how they'll top the previous brutality.<br/><br/>And Isabella Rosselini get's an E for effort, but only after you put on the 'God, I hope she's half the actor her mother was' rose-colored glasses. She's destined to become a regular of campy Halloween costume parties and drag shows after this performance. Lancome ads are a better fit.<br/><br/>David Lynch should be relegated to the Pantheon of Yuck along with Ed Wood and the Pink Flamingos guy. It got of to a good start with the great opening "Blue Velvet" song, shame after about half an hour you didnt really care about were the film was heading, I wanted it to be more but it didnt deliver at all ... completly boring, silly and rubbish, and as with most Lynch films its definatly a select taste which thankfully I dont have! :) How does a superb talent produce great, meaning-laden art when the true world is a small, irrational, nothingness?  That is David Lynch's great dilemma. He himself has said as much: "People can't accept the meaninglessness of life." But how can one become a great painter, when the only color is black and everyone is blind?<br/><br/>Fortunately for Lynch, he's wrong about "people." The great tragedy of our days is that so many people DO accept that life is meaningless. So his attempted rebellions against "the ordinary" become, instead, financially successful, critically acclaimed icons of our empty lives. Poor David, instead of a starving, tortured Van Gogh, he becomes the popular Norman Rockwell of nihilism, the central freak in our favorite sideshow of moral dwarves and genetically defective imaginations.... all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>As a result, there is an essentially pornographic character to his films, especially this one. No, not the sex, or even the sexual perversion. But the evil.<br/><br/>Many years ago, a young homosexual told me he saw gays as divided into two groups: fairies and queers. The fairies were homosexual because they were attracted to men. The queers were attracted to men because they were attracted to homosexuality -- it was perverse. This is the universal attraction of the pornographic, as opposed to the erotic. The excitement of the forbidden, the abnormal, the hidden. The Queer.<br/><br/>In Blue Velvet, David Lynch's favorite Queer is evil, and he treats us to two hours of figurative strip tease with her. This is the dilemma of the conventional nihilist: He is repelled by evil, because of his normal upbringing, and yet his convictions tell him there is no good or evil. There is no valid reason to be repelled by this Queer (because there is really no valid reason for anything). Yet he is repelled, but also attracted. He must come back to watch her strip again and again.<br/><br/>In the end, twentieth-century nihilists such as Lynch and his fans cannot successfully suppress their moral imagination and their demand for meaning in life, just as nineteenth-century Victorians could not suppress their sexuality and passion. Any vision or program based upon such fundamental misunderstandings of human nature is doomed to failure. Reality leaks through the facade. Then the culture's most popular pornography points to its biggest lies.<br/><br/>Thus, 1886 gave us "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," and 1986 gave us "Blue Velvet."  The difference seems to be that R.L. Stevenson knew what he was doing, consciously portraying the neuroses of his time, while Lynch appears to be without a clue. As a result, in 2086 "Jekyll and Hyde" will still be read as literature, but "Blue Velvet" will only be studied as a cultural artifact of the 20th century, not as art.<br/><br/>So, do you want to see this movie? Ask yourself these questions:<br/><br/>1) Do I suffer from major depression, bi-polar disorder, or schizophrenia?<br/><br/>If "yes," avoid this movie, and under no circumstances watch it alone. [This is NOT a joke; it is medical advice. I myself take medication for recurring major depression. Suicide is permanent.]<br/><br/>2) (A) Am I embarrassed for the President when he simplistically calls the 9-11 terrorists "evil-doers," without trying to understand their grievances and culture?<br/><br/>If "yes,"  BUY a copy of this movie. You'll watch it again and again.<br/><br/>If "no,"  ask yourself:<br/><br/>2) (B) Would I like to watch a talented actor (Dennis Hopper) give a spellbinding portrayal of a truly evil human being?<br/><br/>If "yes," you may want to watch this. Just realize that, like most rape victims, you'll want to spend an hour in the shower afterwards.  I recommend that, instead, you watch the massively underrated Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear (1962) or The Night of the Hunter (1955).<br/><br/>Regardless of your answers above, if you're intellectually curious, if you'd like to know what Lynch is really trying to say, borrow this movie for free from somewhere and watch it until the shot of the bugs. Then turn it off. You'll have gotten his point. You'll only have invested a few minutes of your time. And you won't have to wash your hands afterwards.<br/><br/>Finally, if you want a better understanding of the cultural neuroses that produced this movie, I recommend two surprisingly unrelated books, both by undisputed masters of English prose.  The first, "The Abolition of Man" by C.S. Lewis, is an essay on human nature masquerading as a treatise on the philosophy of education. It's a much lighter and more entertaining read than that capsule summary sounds. The second, "Witness" by Whittaker Chambers, is formally the story of his life, his work as a spy, his break with the Communist Party, and his exposure of his fellow spies. But the book is actually an impassioned memoir of his own spiritual struggles against 20th century moral nihilism.<br/><br/>[All scholars of all political stripes agree that archives declassified since the end of the Cold War conclusively show that Chambers was telling the truth about himself, Hiss, and the other Communist spies. So we can now read "Witness" without worrying about who was really lying. We know Hiss was lying.]<br/><br/>My rating: 3 out of 10. [Dennis Hopper: 8 of 10.   David Lynch: on a scale of 0 to 10, -5] With terrible dialog like "My nipples are getting hard, you can touch them" and excessively bizarre and unnecessary brutality and sex, Blue Velvet is a film I refused to take seriously.<br/><br/>How can this film be considered a masterpiece, by both critics and audiences alike? It degrades women, and violence seems to be presented in a rather pretentious matter. People defend the film sayings it class, but its pure trash that ranks alongside horrors such as "Showgirls". Yes, I'm not going to be in the majority of people that worship this movie... its absolute trash, and how it is today regarded as a classic, is beyond me.<br/><br/>1/10, simply because 0 isn't applicable. Let it first be said that everyone who considers themselves a serious student of film or a film fan in general should see "Blue Velvet" on principle alone-- this review is intended for people who have seen it, and thus contains SPOILERS. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is that rare breed of film: an unquestioned modern masterpiece and iconic classic, upheld by IMDb geeks and Entertainment Weekly-pop culture hounds as something remarkably special. Everybody seems to like it, and everybody's got their own reason. So many people from all walks of life appreciate Blue Velvet as a truly original film. Some see it as allegory, some simply as a living nightmare, some as genuinely effective psyhosexual drama, some as a coming-of-age story etc. I've seen "Blue Velvet" a total of six times now. The first time, I admit a prejudicial point of view-- I wanted to prove Roger Ebert right in his criticism of it, because Ebert was my hero at the time. I was unimpressed. Later, I returned to it after a number of critics upheld it as the genuine article. I'd seen 2001's Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, and loved both of them (although I found MD was somewhat a poor execution of LH)-- perhaps I was more prepared for Lynchian weirdness this time around. Nope. I was still unimpressed, although I was entranced by the stunning visual look of the film. I re-watched it twice a week later, but my opinion still remained the same. Recently, I found myself picking it up again, after seeing Mulholland Drive with an artsy group of friends who were convinced that they could explain everything that happened in it to me, and pretty much did (except for the blue box and the scene with the huge dude who knocks out the director's wife), they then went on to discuss Blue Velvet. With an increased appreciation of Lynch and hearing more admiration for this film, I returned to what most consider his masterpiece and most well-known feature, ironically enough, prejudiced IN ITS FAVOR this time around. <br/><br/>Well, I'm still not impressed. "Blue Velvet" thinks it's so damn complex and subversive. It thinks it's turning Americana on its head by depicting sexual perversion behind seemingly perfect white picket fences. I don't think it's doing anything at all. Granted, for forty minutes or so, "Blue Velvet" is compelling. From the opening scene to the discovery of the ear all the way up to Dennis Hopper's unforgettable appearance and including the dream sequence afterwards, Lynch had me hooked. He seemed at that point to be ready to go for broke, to show us unimaginable horrors, to penetrate through to the darkest aspects of human nature. <br/><br/>Yet something odd happens after the forty minute mark-- the story that we thought was gradually unfolding into something complex and sinister stops unfolding altogether. After forty minutes, we have all the plot we're going to get. We have a woman held in sexual slavery by a drug dealer who has kidnapped her husband and son, we have the naive college kid who tries to help her out, we have the sweet high school girl he's falling in love with, and that's all we have. Those expecting "Blue Velvet" to "go somewhere" from this point will be sorely disappointed. <br/><br/>In the end, "Blue Velvet" goes down an entirely conventional path towards its conclusion. Instead of exploring the Hopper character, Lynch makes him into a campy villain. Instead of exploring the Rosellini character, Lynch makes her into a conventional damsel in distress, longing after her husband and son. Instead of exploring the MacLachlan character, Lynch turns him into an uninteresting do-gooder. The latter choice is particularly odd, given that Lynch has set him up to have his whole world turned upside-down-- yet he heroically takes everything in stride and saves the day. <br/><br/>Most egregious of all is the resolution of the plot, which I've got to assume is intended as a joke on the viewer. After all of Lynch's pretensions about inverting Americana, he gives us a reaffirmation of it, in the form of a conventional ending in which a simple act of violence restores the natural order of things, the robins make everything better, and, gee, everything's just great! Even though I'm sure this is intended as ironic, I found myself frustrated anyway. If Lynch isn't going to take his art seriously, why should the viewer? <br/><br/>I don't want to seem like I'm making an attack on Lynch, although it may seem that way, as I'm criticizing his most canonized work. Lynch has proved that he is capable of taking himself seriously, and developing stories that go places-- even if they work with a logic that conventional films do not. "Blue Velvet," by contrast, goes nowhere and does nothing truly unusual or interesting in the process. I've endeavored to work my way around to enjoying it, but I can't. It simply is not interesting, as a dramatic work, or even as an abstract collection of images. <br/><br/>I would direct those who want to see Lynch at his best to "Eraserhead", the highly underrated "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me," "Lost Highway" (my personal favorite), and, in a more conventional vein (well, relatively speaking), the steamy "Wild at Heart". These are virtuoso films that see the director exploiting the most fearsome resources of cinema to lead his viewers on journeys that begin and end, with point and purpose. They are masterpieces, and no matter what anyone tells you, they make sense if you are willing to do the intellectual heavy-lifting. Compared to these later works, "Blue Velvet" is positively forgettable. Stil, check it out, and form your own opinion. The only real reason, or the only likable aspect of this jumbled mess is the performance by Dennis Hopper. Everything is else comes off as being disastrous, the script probably could have been written by a ten year old, and the actors look like complete amateurs, with the exception of Hopper. When Isabella Rossellini and Laura Dern try to come across as being serious, I howled with laughter.<br/><br/>David Lynch has never really made a good film, in my opinion. "The Straight Story" and "The Elephant Man" were good movies; but they didn't follow Lynch's style. "Mulholland Dr." is the kind of result you get after smoking hallucination drugs. He pieced his visions together and made them look like art, and he did that here....and worst of all, people actually bought it.<br/><br/>The film is uneventful, dull, vile, pointlessly exploitive and unbelievably cheesy. No classic here, guysalthough many pseudo-intellectual morons seem to think so. *1/2 out of **** This picture was described by my fellow viewer as an insult to his intelligence. I agree. There is little to commend it: The script is barren, the concept not credible, the acting obvious and thus not believable. This is a waste of time and not a credit to those involved in producing it. How could a film this awful receive such high praise from the critics?  The answer lies in the degeneration of our culture by 1986.  This is essentially a teen slasher flick, with more gruesomes added on to bring the 15-year-old males into the theaters.  It's simply disgusting.  And stupid.  In one scene, our teen hero is slashed by a knife in the face.  The next day, there is isn't a hint of a scar.  He's beaten savagely in one scene, and within days shows no marks of the event.  If you like to see a naked girl screaming and running about and a villain hurling four letter words while he threatens mayhem, this is just your flick.  Shame on the critics. Ok, I apologize because I am going to be sparse on words with this review. I have seen hundreds of movies.  Of the top 250 on IMDB and of the AFI's top 100, I have seen almost all of the listed films.  Outside of this I have seen films across the spectrum from populist to artistic.<br/><br/>I would have to say this is one of the worst movies of all time.<br/><br/>I will say that the movie was incredibly well done.  Cinematography, symbolism, costuming, acting, etc were done with perfection.  It was just done for a useless cause.  The entire story is one not worth telling or having shown.  There is no worthiness in the story.<br/><br/>-Paragraph is slight spoiler- The essential point is a conflict of light/dark good/evil dichotomy (sp?) has been told in many other films and much better.  This film portrays a confused, deranged, off universe that is no ones life or experience.<br/><br/>The movie to me was awful.  Possibly one of the worst I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I review this movie to at least possibly provide saving someone else the trouble of going through this useless film. I got the movie because I heard it was a classic while watching the game show Jeopardy. It was a classic alright it was one of the strangest movies I ever saw. I would not recommend it to anyone and now get a laugh out of the word "classic". It is a low budget flick with a predictable story line using over the top porno/psycho scenes to get some kind of viewer interest. Dennis Hopper breathing from an oxygen mask constantly was getting a little bit silly by the end of the movie. I like Isabella Rossellini but standing nude on some ones front lawn for no apparent reason was not the way I pictured her in a "classic" movie. Maybe I'm a little old fashioned but her mother's performance in Casablanca probably contributed to the disappointment. Twenty-three years have passed since David Lynch's Blue Velvet sent shockwaves throughout the movie world. It caused a global sensation that would be extremely difficult to equal. But does it really live up to its hype? Yes. The reason I bought a DVD player was because of Blue Velvet. I had worn out my VHS copies and wanted to view this digitally. This is a classic film. If someone ever asked me what David Lynch is about, I'd show them this film. College student Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan, Twin Peaks & Desperate Housewives) returns to his hometown of Lumberton (the kind of town where everyone knows everyone) when his father collapses and must be hospitalized. While home, Jeffrey discovers a severed human ear in a field and begins, with the help of Sandy Williams, a local high school girl played by Laura Dern (Jurassic Park), to play amateur detective. His gum-shoeing leads him to mysterious third-rate lounge singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini, Immortal Beloved). Jeffrey discovers that Dorothy's husband (the former owner of the ear) and son are being held hostage by a psychopath named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper, Easy Rider) because Frank's in love with Dorothy and will do anything to have her. I will not reveal the rest, you must discover this for yourself.<br/><br/>David Lynch is a hard nut to crack because he's more concerned with his personal experience of the world than he is in the mechanics of narrative. At their worst, his films tend to be so bogged down in the inner workings of his own head that they're relatively meaningless to anyone who happens not to be David Lynch. They're chock full of symbols that have visceral resonance but lack the intellectual meaning that unites them with conventional models of theme and narrative. Narrative arcs often arrive at dead ends; I'm still convinced it wasn't until somewhere towards the middle or end of the first season of Twin Peaks that it dawned on Lynch the audience out there in TV land were watching because they believed he was going to tie up all the weirdnesses and convolutions and give them narrative closure like proper TV shows always do. That's when things got scary for him. He didn't purposely deceive anyone; he was just being David Lynchthe weirdnesses and convolutions are what it's all about for him.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet works because it so perfectly balances Lynch's idiosyncrasies with recognizable and comfortable narrative constructs, specifically film noir. In many ways, it moves like a conventional detective story. Jeffrey Beaumont is our surrogate (just as, say, Sam Spade is our surrogate in The Maltese Falcon): we learn the facts of the case as he does. The details encountered in our progress through the narrative, however, are anything but conventional. Images of a severed human ear cast away in a field and teeming with ants, or a Jack Russell terrier snapping at water coming out of the garden hose gripped by Jeffrey's collapsed father, or Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap) in creepy pancake makeup and lounge-lizard clothing lip-syncing into a lamp, or the bad cop literally dead on his feet are certainly bizarre but, within the solid footing of noir, have the effect of adding authenticity to the filmthey're so strange and dream-like they feel true. In other words, the noir elements of Blue Velvet give us the orientation we need to fully experience its Lynchian peculiarities. The Lynchian peculiarities, on the other hand, challenge our expectations of conventional noir, adding levels of interest (and strangely, reality) to a structured and well-known form. Jeffrey Beaumont is the linchpin (or, more accurately, Lynchpin) of the whole film. He's not only the detective, our surrogate for the noir narrative, but also Lynch's surrogate, the vehicle through which the director unveils his subconscious musings. Because of this dual function and our narrative identification with him, Jeffrey enables us to get past Lynch's solipsism and actually connect with the film. Since Lynch is far more fascinated with expression of the visceral than of the intellectual, the success of the film is contingent on the success of Jeffrey as a character because it's our identification with Jeffrey that enables Lynch to produce in us the emotional response he's looking for. By working at Jeffrey through narrative and film technique, Lynch manipulates our empathy with nearly the expertise of Hitchcock (in the Siskel & Ebert review included on the disc, Gene Siskel says Blue Velvet had the same emotional impact on him as Psycho, making him feel like he was getting in way over his headhe's right on the money). Hitchcock understood in a way Lynch doesn't (based on the his inability to deliver consistently top-notch work) that once he'd gotten an audience to identify with a particular character, he could lead (or mislead) them, manipulate them, produce the emotional responses he wanted. In the iconic scene in which Jeffrey's spying on Dorothy through the slats of her apartment's closet, we're voyeurs too. We see the world through his eyes. Consequently, when psychopath Frank Booth tells Jeffrey, "We're the same," he's saying it to us, too. Is it creepy and chilling? Hell, yes. But it's the essence of Lynch's world: creepiness and perversion and violence aren't aberrations; they're presence below the surface of civilization is constant. You can explain that to someone intellectually, but it's much more effective to make him feel it in a below-the-belt, hard-to-articulate way.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a superb film and has grown to be appreciated as one of those timeless classics -- which it undoubtedly is (how many times will I have to question why this is isn't on IMDb's top 250 yet). Genuienly shocking and provocative thriller from David Lynch firmly remains his most controversial film, and one of his best.<br/><br/>Young man returns to his North Carolina hometown, where he gets caught up in the madness of its secret criminal underworld.<br/><br/>Cult director Lynch more than showed his boldness (and his love for film noir cinema) with this twisted and dark gripper. In a sense Lynch takes the ideal small-town America and turns it inside out as he exposes the sinister underside of a seemingly innocent town, much like he later would with his classic TV series Twin Peaks (1990-1992). The story is solidly intriguing, but in an increasingly uneasy way as our likable young hero is plunged into the madness of a gang of truly sleazy characters. It builds to some great moments of intense suspense, as well as some very steamy sex scenes. Lynch's direction is unique as always, giving the film an atmosphere of dread and the occasional touch of surrealism.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Kyle MacLachlan is charming and believable as our endangered hero. Isabella Rossellini does a nice turn with her attractive singer character. Dennis Hopper makes for a perfectly insane villain. Young Laura Dern is also good as MacLachlan's love interest.<br/><br/>An unforgettable film all the way, Blue Velvet is the kind of wild trip that few films can ever offer. Not for all tastes, but the game will be engrossed.<br/><br/>**** out of **** A David Lynch classic, in all of its whacked out glory. The first time I saw this I was in high school, it was around the time Lost Highway was released, and I love that film. I saw that on the cover it had "from David Lynch, the director of Blue Velvet". So naturally, I was interested in viewing his other films. I had heard by people that Blue Velvet has become a classic film, and it was quite controversial. I watched it, expecting a masterpiece, and I was let down. I thought it was dull, uneventful, unpleasant and pretentious. It seemed to me that Lynch was trying to hard. The character of Frank Booth was a major distraction and the only redeeming quality of the film. However, another person told me a few months later that Blue Velvet was a film that benefited from multiple viewings. So in about 2001 or 2002, after the release of the special edition DVD, I re-watched it. It instantly became my favourite movie.<br/><br/>As I got older I began to appreciate the film on entirely other levels. And now, at 28 I love it even more. The originality of it all, the surrealism, the symbolism mixed with off-beat humour made it something revolutionary by great film-making. So many sequences in the film are brilliantly shot and conceived, notably the opening scene in which an old man collapses in his garden. Then there is the metaphoric part in which the camera zooms into the perfect-looking grass to reveal swarming insects. This is a metaphor representing the evil and darkness to be found under a seemingly pristine idyll surface.<br/><br/>There's downbeat violence and a disturbing tone that has never been matched. There's beauty in its brutality and a cohesiveness sorely missing in a lot of Lynch's other work. Although initially I loved Lost Highway, Dune etc., there's something missing. Blue Velvet feels epic and intimate at the same time. It's imaginative and awe inspiring, a film that has yet to be equaled. Not since STOP THE WORLD I WANT TO GET OFF, have I seen such a miserable, stupid movie. Back in the drive-in days of STOP THE WORLD... the audience blasted their car horns till the theater shut off the movie and played the second feature. Oh God, if only there were car horns in our living rooms. But fortunately there's always the remote. If you have an addiction to poorly acted movies, then by all means, don't miss this. I'm sure there must be an audience of horrible movie addicts who would just love this miserable mess, but I'm not one of them. When you first start watching this debacle you keep thinking to yourself that it's GOT to get better, but trust me, it doesn't! It's a slow slide into hell with no redeeming absolution. THIS INCLUDES A SPOILER!!  DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>I can't believe how bad this film is.  I have never seen any Twin Peaks episodes, but I am told that this movie was much like a Twin Peaks story, and thus, I will never waste a precious minute of my life watching another David Lynch. This movie was made to be 'odd' just for the sake of being odd, and there's no message in this movie.  Other films that I have watched and said,"Wow, that was really f---up up," have included some purpose for telling the story.  There is no point or purpose to Blue Velvet. I have never before felt strongly about the acting in a movie because I tend to believe it is the characters that we truly love, not the people playing them.  But this movie had some terrible acting. Also, why were Jeffrey and the girl making out after he just killed Frank? They just walked out of the most gruesome of scenes.  There was no building of a relationship between those two.  Lynch just wanted a love interest, so they instantly 'loved' each other. The actors are doing their job. I've always enjoyed Kyle MacLachlan. I think what concerns me the most is that, while this movie is listed as one of the worst regarding its perverse theme, a significant number of viewers found it much less exciting than they had anticipated. One individual said that his first viewing of it caused intense disgust and horror, but then after a decade or so, when he viewed it for the second time, he found it interesting and possibly informative. This particular viewer thought that he had matured sufficiently to better appreciate what Blue Velvet had to say. However, it seems to me, considering the responses of many young people, our later generations of viewers have come to accept as near normal, much of what earlier generations would not have accepted either as normal or exciting to view. <br/><br/>In some cases understanding the darker side would be admirable, but when it comes to accepting sadomasochism as interesting or normal, it's like the story of the woman during wartime, being tortured before she managed to escape to the US. Her torturer electrified, burned and skewered pieces of flesh off her, ravaged her private parts and listened to her screams, before checking his watch and calling his wife to casually tell her he would be late for supper. Extreme, intentional cruelty was totally accepted as part of his daily business. For years my parents would not let me see this movie. They said it was sick and horrid and one of the worst, nasty films ever. I finally saw it about two years ago and I can safely say "Really?" I'm sure that in 1986 this film was a big shocker, but seeing as how I am a jaded teen, this film was just...blah. Blah. Why does this film deserve the sheer amount of praise that it gets? Sure, it's a pretty good movie, but one of the greatest films of all time? No! Now, I'm sure all you Lynch-supporters are going to wish me dead, and I don't care. I can see why people would like this...it's like "Antichrist". We'll put a bunch of crazy insane crap in this movie, but also make it a heartfelt drama, and in come the raves. What? Okay, I'm beginning to make about as much sense as this movie does. Uh-oh...the Lynchinoids are gonna get for that one too.. Consider the opening scenes of BLUE VELVET.  A shot of red flowers against a white picket fence.  A firetruck passes, a riding fireman waving at the camera.  A man waters his lawn--but wait!--he's hurt, and his beautiful lawn his hiding a community of disgusting vermin.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, Lynch's got style.  Most of his movies are masterpieces of style, and the guy knows how to get a reaction out of his audience.  But is that enough?  BLUE VELVET is all style and no substance--it's got great shots, a genuinely scary villain, some funny and some not-so-funny dialogue, but when you strip away all the artifice you merely have a movie with no soul.  And that would be all right, it really would, if it weren't for the troubling themes that the movie unearths.<br/><br/>Jeffrey (Kyle McLachlan) returns to Lumberton, the idyllic town of his youth, and finds a severed ear in a field.  The ear is his entrance into the underworld that lies beneath the false paradise of his small town, an underworld populated by nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and the bogeyman, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).  Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and child, and is using his leverage to force Dorothy into a kinky S&M routine.<br/><br/>All this is stylishly filmed and intercut with a small-town satire.  Lynch keeps us at arm's length, never letting us get too close to his characters. Every time they reveal an unexpected depth, we are kept off balance by the lighter side of the film--some really absurd and humorous dialogue or some shallow message of hope by the perky blonde Sandy (Laura Dern).<br/><br/>But wait a minute--there's a woman being sexually abused here.  Not only that, but she seems to like it, asking Jeffrey to hit her.  And Jeffrey is pulled into the sadomasochism too, actually obeying Dorothy's wishes.  Lynch is pulling us into some serious stuff here, but why?  What does it all mean?<br/><br/>In the end, nothing.  Lynch is just doing what he does best: pushing our buttons.  Pushing them skillfully, to be sure.  But I'll be honest--that doesn't really do it for me.  I don't care if the guys got skill; I want to see him treat his characters with the respect that they deserve.  I want him to take the darkness in this film seriously, not gloss it over with some humorous Mayberry stuff or a trite dream about robins and some lesson about love. Before you smite me, I am not bothered by the torture, Voyeurism, or rape portrayed, but rather the dulling effect of this movie. To me, a great film does not have the symbolism of waving firemen, roses, and white picket fences to show innocence but rather underlying themes and philosophical reasoning. There were no prominent educational themes of this movie and nothing to relate to or better yourself from. To me this was just a watered down Clockwork Orange and a bit like American Beauty and I would recommend those excellent movies much more than this one. I am truly ashamed this is called an American Classic as it left me feeling completely apathetic and it did not withstand the times what so ever. But really, I judge a movie on how well it does three things; to entertain, to persuade, and to move not even mentioning to educate and just try to argue with me that this did any of those things. It's personal all right, also solipsistic, intransigent, and occasionally ridiculous. David Lynch's 1986 fever-dream fantasy has become a wildey regarded classic of bizarre cinema. The film has somewhat of a Hitchocken-esquire plot, in which a young college student (Kyle MacLachlan) returned to his small-town roots and all manner of strangeness, is replete with sexual fear and loathing, parodistic inversions (of Capra, Lubitsch), and cannibalistic recyclings from Lynch's own Eraserhead and Dune.<br/><br/>The bizarrely evolving story--MacLachlan becomes involved with two women, one light and innocent (Laura Dern, vaguely lost), the other dark and sadomasochistic (Isabella Rossellini), as well as with a murderous psychopath (a brilliantly demented Dennis Hopper)--seems more obsessive than expressive at times, and the commingling of sex, violence and death. What I didn't enjoy was how it seems so shallow and dull in some moments. And all to pretentious. Still, the film casts its spell in countless odd ways, in the archetype-leaning imagery, eccentric tableau styling, and moth-in-candle-flame attraction to the subconscious twilight. A bit overrated. It's a strange world isn't it?" Naive words from a man who doesn't know the half of it. I've said it before and I'm going to say it again, David Lycnh is someone you will either love or hate, there is no inbetween with this man. But he has a certain aura surrounding him. It's like all of his films have this kenetic pull that even though what your watching is wrong, you can't help but wonder what will happen next. He also has a very identifiable method of story telling, where most directors are criticised for leaving losse endings dangling in their films, we want to give Lynch Oscars for those exact same loose ends. That's the magic of it, a movie like the Sixth Sense will drop you hints that by the third time you see it you will have everything figured out. On the other hand you could watch a Lynch film twenty times and still be no better odd than you were the first time. That's why you either love or hate this man, he provides you with the story, the rest is up to the imagination of the audience. Writing a review about a Lynch without saying it is weird or disturbing would be an understatement, so here goes. This is a weird and disturbing tale of Jeffry (Kyle MacLaclon) who, after finding a human ear takes matters into his own hands and gets involved with a nightclub singer and a profane mob boss type who has a fetish for blue velvet. That's about all there is to say, the rest is up to you to figure out. LIke usual, the acting is all mellowdramatic and seems like it is out of a bad soap opera and not a psychotic thriller. Maybe I'm going out on a limb here and maybe that limb belongs to an unstable tree but arn't dreams funny things? You may not understand them but they all have a meaning and no matter how weird they are and how little sense they make you still enjoy having them, think about that for awhile and then go see this movie, you may not like it but it's an experience you will not soon forget. Now here is a film that polarizes its audience. Everyone who has seen it either loves or hates it. Some, such as Roger Ebert, find it to be well made but morally offensive for how Lynch uses the actors. Others enjoy the stylish aspect of the movie and give it high marks. I fall into the latter camp but I also don't think that it's quite morally contemptable either.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is all around excellent. Dennis Hopper is especially convincing as a sadistic personality. Isabelle Rossellini will also haunt you in her performance as an abused, masochistic woman under the perpetual torment of Hopper. All of this depravity plays against the backdrop of a corny neighborhood and characters that seem straight out of a 1950s sitcom.<br/><br/>Ebert thought that Lynch wasn't playing fair by having his characters tormented and humiliated in one scene and then having silly ironic humor in the next. This is the same Ebert who loved Pulp Fiction. Is PF any better when it jokes about accidently shooting an innocent man in the back of a car? How about the homosexual rape sequence? Is that any less perverse?<br/><br/>
But I digress. Yes this movie jumps between two extremes of human nature but in my opinion in doing so it is making a statement. Most of us have skeletons in our closets and if not, we know people who do. We put on a facade of "normalcy" so that we can coexist but just under the surface there is still that animal nature, that beast waiting to get out. There's a little bit of Dennis Hopper in all of us. Perhaps this movie is so upsetting because it forces us to realize that truth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
***1/2 out of **** stars It is said that the most disturbed and the most bizarre people come out of the midwest. Well, Lynch fits this to a tee. Aside from this movie being dark and eerie, it also has some of the best-and funniest- lines in movies ever(Observe Frank's(Dennis Hopper) take on beer and breasts) Many people do not "get" Lynch or think he is too bizarre or try too hard to find something,anything, in his work. Many think that he does not know how to make a REAL movie(i.e. linear plot with an ending that explains everything or ties up loose ends) as opposed to moving art(See any Roger Ebert review of any Lynch film). All you have to do is see this film to see Lynch's brilliance. Don't  put too much into it, but don't dismiss it. Well cast, excellent direction.. All-time classic. Frank has to be the best role Dennis Hopper ever played. Blue Velvet is one of my favorite films of all time. I think I could perhaps write an entire book on the meanings that I have interpreted from it. For the purposes of this posting I will try and condense it to a few of the main ideas and thems that are evident throughout.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet lends itself to many psychoanalytic interpretations. It illustrates quite elegantly that people have a dark side, and beneath our innocence that most other people see, lie our subconscious perversions just waiting to be unleashed. The film assumes to an extent that we are all as human being voyeurs, to a certain degree.<br/><br/>The first theme that I draw from "Blue Velvet" is that people are in constant battle between their 'id' and their 'superego', to speak in Freudian terms. The 'id' is ruled by the pleasure principle and its major purpose is immediate satisfaction of our needs. In theory, the 'id' is only present in infants and animals, but "Blue Velvet" clearly challenges this notion. Jeffrey Beaumont is a blatant representation of the 'id'. He can't avoid satisfying his curiosity and voyeuristic needs. He wants to know exactly what is going up in the apartment of Dorothy Vallens, and he'll stop at nothing until he knows what the town gossip is all about. The 'id' is challenged by the 'superego', which is in fact our conscience and based on norms, it maintains information about behavior that is considered to be bad. It is supposed to punish us for being bad with feelings of shame or guilt. Jeffrey feels little guilt about sneaking into the apartment. Sandy feels little guilt about assisting him.<br/><br/>The second theme that is quite apparent in "Blue Velvet" is that people tend to have a dark part of the inner self. On the surface, the world looks very innocent. We see happy families together in the back yard, we see a couple walking happily along a path holding hands. We see local neighbours driving by waving at us. The reality is, despite what you see on the surface, you have no idea what these people are saying, thinking, or doing when they are not within your visual field. In the film there is a scene with Jeffrey and Sandy walking together along a sidewalk in the night. To someone passing by, they would likely think that they are just another couple going for a walk, and have no idea of their voyeuristic intentions. Essentially, they plan a scheme to sneak into Dorothy's apartment to watch her under what seem like everyday, normal conditions (walking together, sitting in the local diner).<br/><br/>That people have an infantile or child-like view of the world is also another motif present within the film. To a great extent, this theme relates back to the two previous ones which I have mentioned. The curiosity that we constantly see on Jeffrey's face in many situations places him quite often in the concept of the 'id'. On the surface, he looks like a normal college kid, but deep down, he has this voyeuristic perversion that the film seems to suggest that we all have. Some of us just more readily display it than others. Adults are supposed to be able to suppress their desires for moral purposes, while children do not. In "Blue Velvet", the adult characters do not suppress their subconscious desires and thus represent a child-like being in the world.<br/><br/>I have only touched on a few of the ideas of "Blue Velvet" very briefly. The evil character of Frank is a whole other story, one that I will not delve into right now. It would take considerable time and space to do an accurate analysis of this man and what he represents. Whew! I just finished seeing this one and give it 3-1/2 stars out of 4. This was a very good film but boy was it ever heavy!<br/><br/>I found 7 "100 Best Films of All Time" lists on the internet and this film appeared on 6 of the 7 (all but the AFI's). This was what prompted me to rent it.<br/><br/>I wonder what Ingrid Bergman (see "Casablanca") would have thought of seeing her daughter, Isabella Rossillini, in this one! I also wonder what the man, Dennis Hopper, is like in real life!<br/><br/>I liked this film because the incredible tension it creates in the viewer never lets go. I also liked it because it paints a VERY realistic portrait of crime, criminals, and the criminal mind. I'm so sick of all these comic-book style crime films from fantasy world. This one was very real and sobering.<br/><br/>As you see from the very diverse comments this film has generated, it is not for everyone. You'll either love it or despise it. But curiosity will make you see it! It was an unusual and a great film when I first saw it in a movie theater back around -86. Recently I saw it again on DVD. The film is still great BUT seriously crippled on transfer to DVD. It's amazing if Lynch has agreed to publish this bad copy! It seems like it's a bootleg copy from a hand held camera. Cropped into 4:3 format, in several scenes action takes place and characters speak outside of the picture. Apart from this major weakness, the quality of the DVD encoding leaves room for much improvement as well.<br/><br/>In the movie Dennis Hopper makes a very good cast among others. I bet Lynch's art and the story in itself has inspired Quentin Tarantino among others.<br/><br/>This is a very good film that deserves proper treatment in transfer to DVD. I sincerely hope a quality widescreen DVD will be published. I will be in the first line to buy... I think this movie is overrated. I heard here and there how great is Blue Velvet and that it's really a masterpiece and one of the best movies of all times. The true is that it's weak even in it's own category and time. There are plenty of significantly better thrillers of 80s in the similar style but underrated. Bringing gore and sexually explicit scenes to this movie does not save the plot, which is very weak if none. Actually, the film is very boring, there is no tension, usual Lynch's mood of mystique is wasted simply because there is no mystique like in his other films. I like Lynch's films, and I remember enjoying Twin Peaks a lot, and music by Angelo Badalamenti is fantastic, which should supposedly create the same atmosphere like in other Lynch's films. But all this is simply wasted, as well as beautiful play of Dennis Hopper, again because the plot is close to nothing. I still wonder what was all this about? How can such a talented director like Lynch make such an empty and boring movie without any sense. And I don't understand all the praises to the movie that I've read and heard. Could someone explain me what was so exciting in this film? (Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>That's 'Blue Velvet' she's singing, and that's blue velvet he's got in his mouth.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper combines pure evil with moral degeneracy in a style not to be forgotten in this original shocker from David Lynch. The juxtaposition of the sleepy logging town with the depraved Hopper and his sick crew really makes the evil stand out. Laura Dern, playing a fifties-style sweetheart, is likewise an apt foil for the compromised and befouled Isabella Rossellini (Ingrid Bergman's daughter, lest we forget) who plays a small town chanteuse with some very kinky sexual needs. Kyle MacLachlan stars as a Nancy Drew wanna-be who gets in a couple of yards over his head.<br/><br/>The plot is as clever as the devil, surprising us at several turns, yet at no time does it go beyond anything reasonable. The characters are vivid, memorable and entirely believable. This is very close to a great movie. To nit-pick I'd have to say that the feel good resolution could have used a touch of Tabasco, and I was a little annoyed at being lead to believe that the father was a bad cop; in fact I have the feeling that Lynch had another ending in mind but gave us the old style Hollywood finale as a second thought.<br/><br/>Rossellini and her apartment-a simple, but exquisitely designed set-will probably stay with me through the next millennium. Also indelible is Hopper sucking on oxygen or nitrous to turbo himself up to do dirty deeds. The bit from Dean Stockwell as the clown-faced gay, lip syncing a Roy Orbison tune as we wait to see what he and Hopper are going to do to MacLachlan, made my skin crawl. This film's twisted, but more than that it's also incredibly dumb. The villain's violent, fine, but he also uses the f word in just about every sentence he speaks. That's how you show someone's evil, I guess.<br/><br/>In addition, the characters do really stupid things for no reason other than to get themselves into trouble, and plot's pretty non-existent. From the beginning they show an incredible level of idiocy. For instance, do you pick up a human ear you come across with your bare hands?<br/><br/>Another complaint: many of the images are revolting, but if that's the point, then it's no point at all.<br/><br/>A worthless, sick "movie" that if you can enjoy, well, that may be enlightening. Blue Velvet is a great place to start if you want to introduce people to the art of David Lynch. It is not simply one of Lynch's more accessible films, but it also showcases the genius' methods and themes wonderfully. From characterization to color to stagecraft, this is one of Lynch's most subtle, beautiful, linear, and yet wholly unnerving works. Get the Special Edition - the extras alone are worth the cost.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is widely regarded as one of Lynch's masterpieces. But the concept of 'masterpiece' is too reductionist to be applied to works of art - which all of Lynch's films are. Each film's success can only be measured by the extent and quality of engagement with each individual consciousness in the audience. And almost every year Lynch has released a film, I have - in my own prolific imagination - handed him several Oscars and Palmes D'Or.<br/><br/>The story is about a normal American college student (Jeffrey - Kyle Maclachlan) who comes home to help out while his father recovers from a heart attack. On his way back from the hospital, Jeffrey finds an ear. The ear leads him to a sociopath (Frank - Dennis Hopper); a woman living with the constant threat of rape, whose loved ones are in the hands of a monster (Dorothy - Isabella Rosselini); and a beautiful high school senior (Sandy - Laura Dern) with whom a powerful friendship develops. With this general premise, it should be no surprise that the film contains a very disturbing scenes of sexual violence, sadism, and humiliation. But even so, it gives its characters such great sympathy that human dignity becomes a central and important theme throughout. Many will be very disturbed by the psychological torture endured by Frank's victims - and well they should - the kind of depravity in which Frank is engaged should never be soft-pedaled or sold short.<br/><br/>I will start with the easy stuff. Contrary to Mr Ebert's famously bizarre opinion about this film, Ms. Rosselini is nothing short of BRILLIANT opposite Kyle MacLachlan in what is really the female lead of Blue Velvet. Her Dorothy is powerfully emotional, intense and extremely disturbing, and very sensitively and carefully performed. Dennis Hopper is mesmerizing for his visceral, insane and downright scary portrayal of swaggering psychopath Frank. These two supporting roles are what tie the entire film together, in many ways, although the story is told exclusively from the vantage point of Kyle Maclachlan's Jeffrey. Maclachlan's often understated, intelligent and sometimes exuberant style fits the character very nicely, and Laura Dern's (at the age of 18) innocent, naive, lovely, and emotional portrayal of Sandy is a great counterpoint. I can only avoid a spoiler by leaving out what makes Maclachlan and Dern's characters truly great, but I will mention one aspect of Jeffrey's story arc which perhaps bears more consideration - compare what happens to him in Blue Velvet to the experience of Marge Gunderson in Fargo, and think about where these two characters end up.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet assembled many of Lynch's behind-the-scenes regulars. The Sound design was by the brilliant Alan Splet. Check out his portfolio and you will instantly understand what this means. Sound is extremely important both in the front (Badalamenti and Cruise soundtrack) and rear (Splet) of Lynch's films, and great editing and cinematography allow them to become united in his films' dream-like sensuality. Blue Velvet provides many examples of this, but is not nearly as extreme as many of his less linear surreal works (i.e. Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire). Again, this is a great introduction to Lynch.<br/><br/>Visually, the film, like most of Lynch's work, is incredible. Lynch's sense of place, his sets and his detailed, obsessive visualization, is rarely equaled. An incredible amount of thought and effort went into the use of color throughout this film, and yet there is nothing overwhelming about any of it. The camera-work and performances are powerful enough to prevent any of the sets from becoming anything more than a great complementary element.<br/><br/>Red wine is really a pretty simple thing. So is Blue Velvet's plot. However, like some of the better reds, this archetypal Lynch film carries with it a sensory experience which is far more complex and multifaceted than what can be described as a 'taste'. The best way to introduce somebody to red wine is not to force Opus One or a 1980s Rothschild on them, but to give them a nice frisky glass of Beaujolais or a spicy Shiraz and get them interested in the more profound stuff later. Blue Velvet is Lynch's Shiraz. Elephant Man may be his Beaujolais. Save Eraserhead and some of the others mentioned above for more seasoned tasters. This is a great film introduction to aesthetic universe of one of America's most original and visionary directors. David Lynch is the master of regression in service of the ego on film.  He first established this fact with "Eraserhead" and continued his journey through off-beat realms in "Wild at Heart" and "Lost Highway". By this I mean his subjects examine the depths of human depravity and malaise.  Bordering on psychosis and self indulgence he nevertheless draws the viewer into his personal surrealism.<br/><br/>With "Blue Velvet" he introduces a new eeriness to the screen that almost seems symbolic at times, but is actually fascinatingly bizarre and just beyond comprehension in much the same fashion as the imagery of a nightmare. My first viewing of the film led me to conclude that the characters were all projections of the protagonist's personailty.  It all leads to a scary journey and a tattered shattering tale.  A flawed but seemingly original creation. David Lynch's (Oscar-nominated for directing here) typical strangeness runs amok in this over-rated would-be-thriller that only comes to life when show-stopper Dennis Hopper is on screen. Lumberton, USA seems to be a typical small town, but there is darkness there. A severed ear is found one day by Kyle MacLachlan and he decides to start his own investigation with the police chief's daughter (the equally dull Laura Dern) when they come to the conclusion that the cops will never find out the real truth. Together they learn that there are really dangerous underground figures in their sleepy little town. There is the mysterious Isabella Rossellini, a nightclub singer who swears that her son has been kidnapped by drug-addicted sadist Hopper. Naturally Rossellini's highly sexual behavior bewitches MacLachlan and he gets involved in a situation that he may not be able to escape from. Once again Lynch's direction is the greatest asset here. He turns a film that could have been a pure mess into a fascinating movie-going experience. However with that said, his direction and uneven screenplay also hinder at times. Rossellini does the best she can with a character that is a bit too flat to be totally believable. In the end, Lynch's whackiness and Hopper's scene-stealing are the main attractions here. 4 stars out of 5. David Lynch is a man commonly praised as a genius of bizarre imagery and stories. Well, "Blue Velvet" is the only one of his films I've seen, and while I'd still like to see several others, it most certainly turned me off of him quite a bit.<br/><br/>The film follows Jeffrey (MacLachlan), a curious small town boy who discovers a human ear in a field. This causes him to enlist the object of his desire (Dern) to help him investigate and uncover a strange mystery involving a masochistic lounge singer (Rossellini) and a psychotic pervert named Frank Booth (Hopper).<br/><br/>Though the film featured horrible acting from (almost) the entire cast, ridiculously stupid dialogue, and an extremely corny-looking fake bird (don't ask), I think what really bothered me was Lynch's script. It seemed full of contrived plot twists and insanely over-the-top characters meant only for shock value and nothing else (e.g. a laid-back cross-dresser with a fetish for aged overweight women). He seemed to be purposely trying to be bizarre and disturbing, and I really didn't find the film to be much of either. It seemed like your run-of-the-mill "quiet suburbia with a dark side" story.<br/><br/>The film's only redeeming quality is the good performance from Dennis Hopper, but the man is a reliable actor. He did the best that could be done with his role, which was over-the-top and pointless, again, nothing but shock factor.<br/><br/>There are plenty more interesting and well-made films out there about the bizarre and the disturbing, this is one that you really don't need to bother with.<br/><br/>2.5/10 Like I said, if you are sleepy, don't watch this movie because you will definately fall asleep.  It is very slow, it is very weird, and it is very deep.  The acting was so-so, the plot was easy to figure out, and there are no surprises at all.  There are better movies out there to rent than this one... Another overrated flick from David Lynch, a director whose work has mostly been pretentious. Blue Velvet is a very, very simple crime film, with pretentious to be "weird" or "I'm a special filmmaker". There is absolutely nothing layered about it. There's anothing lying under its glitzy, stylish surface. Lynch does good common flicks. Leave the dreamming or symbolic ones to those that know about it (BuÃ±uel).<br/><br/>A fairly simple plot, the film concerns Jeffrey, a young man who has abruptly returned to his ideal, picturesque all-American town after his father becomes ill from an unexplained disease (presumably a heart attack or stroke). After returning from a visit to his father in hospital, Jeffrey finds a human ear in a field and proceeds to investigate all involved. His investigation is aided by information he has obtained from the niave, innocent schoolgirl Laura Dern. The investigation leads him into his towns underworld of drugs and kinky, bizarre sex. He is forced to confront the eptimone of evil, Frank Booth.<br/><br/>The performances are very average. Kyle MacLachlan seems very wooden at times, Laura Dern is not her best her, surprising coming from an actress who has been nominated for an Oscar, while former model and daughter of screen legend Ingrid Bergman, Isabella Rossellini, is downright silly. Dennis Hopper, on the contrary, gives a performance that is both terrfying and ludicrosly over the top. Overall, this is an average and simple crime film that really doesn't deserve the extensive credit it attains. Its visuals are beautiful and there are some good things about it. But its no classic. Although Blue Velvet is ridden with beautiful, saturated colours and flawless imagery, its thin and underwhelming in its human story and is occasionally pretentious film-making.<br/><br/>I probably did not enjoy it as much as expected due to the fact that my friend had hyped it to me and many people had written it off as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is tremendously overrated, which I think is what let me down, it can be entertaining, but I don't see how audiences and critics alike have called this "a classic". I just don't see it. Sometimes there are scenes in which you wonder why they are there. <br/><br/>The film is probably good if your bored, otherwise its your average thriller filled with violence and sex that seems to be there for shock value and nothing else. Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>The only two other Lynch films I saw before viewing this one were Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway. I had lots of expectations before watching this film because not only was it Lynch, but many people said this was their favorite Lynch film. Blue Velvet came out in 1986, Lost Highway in 1997, and Mulholland Drive in 2001. Viewing these films from a technical aspect, one would see the cinematography, sound, and content have progressed, or at least have been refined. Lynch is getting better at making movies because he has more experience as he gets older. Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive are not that far apart in terms of release date as is Lost Highway and Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to make here is that Blue Velvet is a novice effort by Lynch (although I can't say anything about Elephant Man or Eraserhead that preceded this film). This movie is pretty straight-forward compared to his other films. I didn't get much out of it, although I expected a lot from it.<br/><br/>The sense of horror, intensity, and atmosphere in Lynch films is not prevalent throughout this film. In fact few scenes are really that scary. Each time Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) goes up and down the stairs to Dorothy Vallens' (Isabella Rossellini) apartment, the stairway is dark and the proper foreboding sound effects are played. The creepiest scene in the film would have to be when Jeffrey walks into Dorothy's apartment and finds the dead men. <br/><br/>Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) is not the truly evil human being some make him out to be. I can see where they get that idea. Jeffrey, in a conversation with Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), even asks how there could be such evil people in the world. I will concede that he is evil, but I don't think Frank is aware of it. Frankly (no pun intended), I think he is a plain villain who is violent and curses a lot. I don't see any shred of intelligence in him. Intelligent villains (or at least intelligent villains with mental defects) who are evil are really the stuff of true terror. Frank Booth came off as a thug/womanizer.<br/><br/>In the aforementioned conversation Jeffrey has with Sandy, Sandy talks about a dream she has. In this dream, the world is dark, and the robins which represent love will one day bring light back to this world. Until that time comes, there will be trouble in this world. There it is. That's it. That's the only thought-provoking idea in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Jeffrey is a hypocrite. He says how bad Frank is, but he makes love to Dorothy, a woman that is married with child. At the same time, he is cheating on Sandy. Why does Sandy forgive him so quickly? I don't think he should be the moral bearer of this story. Although he'll regret this later, Jeffrey physically hits Dorothy, an act he detested in Frank.<br/><br/>Jeffrey's character is not believable. I understand he likes mysteries, but he seems too eager to solve this one. Even when he sees how dangerous this is, he continues to pry into Dorothy's life. Where does he get this bravery from? In contrast to this, it takes him a while to speak up when the bad guys take him for a ride.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is not one of the better Lynch films. I don't recommend it. Yes, the film contains disturbing scenes and is mostly dark, but the story is not great, even if it is coherent. Some people say this movie represents the dark side of America and Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, and other sorts of stuff like that. To this I say, if a movie is good, it will have a timeless quality to it that generations to come will be able to appreciate. As much as I wanted to like this film, it is not a classic, or even a good movie at that. Lynch is very good at style, without much actual substance. This movie doesn't have any unique style that sets it apart from other suspense/horror type films. When this film was first released it garnered a tremendous amount of critical attention, but watching it now, thirteen years after its release and after "Twin Peaks" and (ugh!) "Wild at Heart," it is apparent that David Lynch's reputation rests on no more than a handful of ideas endlessly recycled.  If only he had taken the trouble to fill up the holes in the plot this might be worth watching, but since "Blue Velvet" lost its power to shock or unsettle long ago it hasn't got much left to offer. I don't get it. What (or where) is the plot? Why did the young man continue to go back to the apartment, knowing his life would be endangered? Curious? I'm curious what would happen if I were to stick my face in a fan, but I'm not going to DO it! They couldn't have found a better actor(?) than Dennis Hopper for his role as Frank. I do admit he did a great job of playing a fruity terror. It seems every role he gets, he portrays weirdos. Good actor. Great acting, all around, but I just had a hard time latching on to any story line. Maybe if I was huffing No2 I could have gotten into it better. There's a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. I don't recommend watching it. Save your time for a Gilligan's Island marathon. This film is absolute crap. It does not deserve any further remark. Hope you believe me and don't lose a minute of your time. The high rating it's got can only be explained either because of that idiotic fashion to overrate weird films, or, eventually, because some hacker has voted hundreds of times. And for if you still don't believe, check Maltin, Ebert, Kael, or whoever serious critic you desire. AWFUL! AWFUL!!! !!!!!!!A-W-F-U-L!!!!!!!! There isn't much more to say.  This movie is the sickest, grossest and most disgusting perversion, like anything else Dennis Hopper has ever done. Isabella Rosselini should have thought twice about appearing in this dog. I tivo'd this movie and was so psyched to sit down and finally watch it. I'd heard so many good things about it, it's a Lynch film, Hopper's in it, how can it go wrong?  I don't know but it sure did.  This has to be the worst movie EVER!  I couldn't delete it from my Tivo fast enough when it was over.  I kept hoping, beyond hope, that something anything would make this at least a 2 rating on my scale but it never made it past 1.  I beg all of you to please, please, don't waste 2.25 hrs on this piece of trash.  Taking out the trash is more interesting than Blue Velvet! How this can be compared with some of the better movies like Clockwork Orange (my fave) is beyond me. And to have a 7.7 rating out of 10 is absolutely amazing.  IMDB really needs to come up with a negative rating scale for movies like this! What was the purpose of this film? I found nothing in it that I could even remotely relate to. It was just a jumble of deviant sex scenes, boring dialogue, & meaningless scenes involving foolish acting people. An utter piece of garbage. Fred Krueger will chop off your head in your dreams. Jason Voorhees will kill you while you are partying with friends. Frank Booth will make you wanna die but he will also make sure that you don't and that's the way I see horror. This is not usual horror film. There isn't much blood but there is some psychological terror and that, I think is more scary than quick death. It's also a pretty weird movie. When I first time saw it, next day I remembered it like it was a dream not a movie. Dennis Hopper did a great job. All other actors were great too. David Lynch is a gifted director and this is his probably best movie. There was some weird visuals and the soundtrack was pretty weird too (the composer of this film was Angelo Badalamenti, he was also a composer of Twin Peaks). Other David Lynch movies are also good but not that good as this one. Horrible movie. It was like a B-rate, poorly produced 'Silence of the Lambs' meets the 'Brady Bunch'. Roger Ebert was right when he only gave it one star. The story is completely unbelievable. A nosy young man finds a human ear in a field and he must find out what's the story behind it. On his investigative journeys he almost loses his life on several occassions but continues to naively return to the 'fire'. The scenes where there is sadistic violence are unsettling. The girlfriend's father, who is a detective, is a complete mismatch for that role. The movie has a tacky, b-rate aura. The scene at the house where the woman's son was being held, looked like the set of a high school play...tacky, tacky, tacky! I don't understand why so many people give this movie rave reviews. I don't know how this movie can possibly be viewed as a masterpiece. I can almost guarantee if Lynch wasn't tied to this movie everyone would call it out for the junk that it is.<br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini's acting was atrocious and it's embarrassing to watch her. The plot is downright stupid and the characters are the personification of nails on a chalkboard. This film is dreadfully boring and over-the-top. People will say they like anything if they think everyone else does.<br/><br/>I've seen better movies on Lifetime. 'Blue Velvet' is a captivating, disturbing & masterful mystery-thriller by David Lynch. Its a yet another strong effort from the film legend! <br/><br/>'Blue Velvet' Synopsis: The discovery of a severed human ear found in a field leads a young man on an investigation related to a beautiful, mysterious nightclub singer & a group of twisted criminals who have kidnapped her child.<br/><br/>'Blue Velvet' deals with love, hate, power & violence. Lynch captures all the themes with dexterity. He delivers a story, that at times, is difficult to watch. Its his bear approach & execution to this story, that turns out to be its biggest advantage. His Screenplay is brilliant, while His Direction is commendable, as always. Cinematography deserves a special mention.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Isabella Rossellini is outstanding. She portrays a difficult part with complete conviction. Kyle MacLachlan is good. Laura Dern is fantastic. The Late/Great Dennis Hopper is terrifyingly evil. His performance continues to haunt even after the film concludes. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Blue Velvet' is a striking effort. Strongly Recommended! From the opening scene, where an average suburban man gets his gardening hose twisted around a bush branch before he collapses from a stroke as the beautiful titular song looms over, David Lynch makes you aware that Blue Velvet is going to be something a little special. Taking place in Lumberton, as Jeffrey Beaumont returns home (Kyle MacLachlan), this is a dark and twisted neo-noir tale for the ages. The whole "suburbia is hell" theme has been played out hundreds of times throughout cinema, and for the most part it's been done in ways that are dreadfully heavy-handed and served to the audience on an easy-to-digest platter. It's a theme that I find potentially fascinating, but am often disappointed when they miss the mark completely.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is the finest example of how to handle this properly, utilizing the suburban setting as an ominous backdrop to the dark journey that Jeffrey heads down. Lynch puts his focus primarily on the narrative, on the sharp thrills and complex characters that Jeffrey encounters in the underbelly of the mild-mannered town, instead of trying to make that theme the central focus. By using it as a background instead of the focal point, he is able to make the narrative even more chilling without ever seeming like he's trying to force that suburban nightmare motif down the audience's throat. He makes it a dark noir thriller that would have worked in any setting, but the placement of it here adds another layer to the nightmare; the fact that something this bizarre and grotesque is happening in the backyard of a safe, quiet American neighborhood. He also surprisingly manages to infuse it with a nice bit of his dark humor ("Yes, that's an ear all right.") that had me in stitches several times.<br/><br/>The narrative drives the film but these characters are what makes this world so intriguing for the audience and for Jeffrey. First Jeffrey meets Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), who is safe and sweet, but she's so appropriately boring. It's when we start to succumb to our dangerous desires that we get introduced to Dorothy Vallens, played with frightened hysteria by Isabella Rossellini. Rossellini turns in a star-making performance here, making Dorothy someone who we want to screw and save but we're never fully aware of how potentially dangerous she is. Dorothy is a character who draws you in immediately, evolving from one thing (the controlling, potentially violent older seducer) into something completely different (the broken and fragile mother) and Rossellini remains believable for this entire transition.<br/><br/>Then of course there's Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth, quite possibly the most terrifying screen villain in cinematic history. Booth is...something out of this world. He's the devil in the suburban hell and Hopper plays him the way that only he could. It's as if Lynch gave him free reign to just let loose all of the rage and terror that Hopper is capable of and he took full advantage of it, creating a monster who you can't stop watching even when you feel that he would kill you on a second. The film doesn't follow many conventional routes and Booth is another example of this, a violent maniac who is truly unpredictable. The main reason why he is so hauntingly terrifying is the fact that at any point you have no idea what he is going to do next. Booth is like the nightmare version of Jeffrey's darkest impulses and desires.<br/><br/>In Jeffrey Beaumont, Lynch has created a character who serves primarily as a surrogate for the audience and mankind as a whole, controlling him with his dangerous desires and impulses. Lynch explores America's fascination with the grim and macabre, expressed through Jeffrey's obsession with Dorothy and the case. He presents an absorbing take on the theme of voyeurism, as Jeffrey hides in closets and behind the wheel of his car, spending as much time spying on the characters as he does interacting with them. Sandy says to Jeff, "I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert", and it's a line that really speaks to America's fascination with those themes of sexuality, violence and twisted deeds; the danger that you can't look away from even it's hurtling towards you.<br/><br/>Taking it at face value, this is a safe and peaceful neighborhood, but when you open the closet (such as the one that Jeffrey himself hides in) you can find any number of skeletons. Lynch's direction is so completely on point for the entire film, creating a hypnotic atmosphere that pulls you in much in the same way that this dark world pulls in Jeffrey. Through the heavenly tinted cinematography and transfixing score, Lynch gives the film a dreamlike aesthetic that makes the nightmare even more chilling. When the film ends you feel as though you yourself are emerging from a dream state. Going into it, the less hype you hear, good or bad, the better. You hear all these things about "it" and when you actually watch "it" for the first time, all that profound analysis or whatever the kids are calling it nowadays can be not unlike a rowdy theater, full of a motley crew of chattering chatter boxes, all making their own shadow puppets on the screen and all in the discomfort of you're already crowded head device mark 12. This means this, that means that, this is wrong, thats right, Colonel Muster with the candle stick... aye yai yai, calgon take me away. Thankfully I saw this movie before I heard to much about it, or even Lynch himself for that matter (whom many seem to see as some kind of fly by night charlatan for some utterly creepy reason, I figure it's sexual jealousy). <br/><br/>All I had was five bucks in my pocket, a blockbuster card, brutal loneliness and a heart full of napalm. It was like some bizarre friend I'd been waiting for without even knowing I was waiting, that was equally adept at making me laugh as making me cry, and in that, I am truly in debt to it in some zany, cooky kind of way. I can say without risk of hyperbole it was one of the most satisfying and powerful cinematic experiences I've had since I was a child (these results are not typical, no refunds.) It seems unfair that the only thing I can give back for that experience is mere praise (we'll try to work on that.) If you have yet to watch it, stop reading all the reviews right now and see it for yourself. You may love it, you may hate it, you may have cheap sex with it and not call it the next day, but it's a swell enough movie to where those are largely the only choices you'll have, he said somewhat cautiously. True, there have been some wonderful and thought provoking things said about this film, in it's praise and in it's opposite, but they're not worth you're dime till you've seen it for you're self and have drawn you're own conclusions, and maybe not even then. For me, the film largely stops when the end credits run, and I don't need anybody telling me why I should like it or despise it, for I have seen the mountian, and it is good.<br/><br/>Many intellectual types (possibly qualified as hard nosed intellectual elitists, who, like red necks, despise what they can't understand.) can't stand Lynch because they have a hard time making heads or tails of his work, but oh the folly, if only they would sit back and allow themselves to feel the film, instead of trying to figure it out as if it is was as simple as some mathematical problem. They listen but they do not hear, eat but do not taste, shift but do no shimmy, etc. etc., blah, blah, blah. I don't care if it's all a gimmick or a bowl of broccoli, it's worth something to me.<br/><br/>In summary, I loved this movie, I'm glad it was made instead of not, and if you're cool, you'll like it too. Young man visits his family in cozy hometown, but after finding a severed ear in a nearby field he follows a trail of corruption, sadism and murder. David Lynch-directed torment, full of bright and beguiling colors, features many of his now-familiar themes (the city vs. the suburbs, the evil which lurks under our everyday existence), but it was a lot more provocative in 1986 than today. And, since time has not been kind to the presentation, attentions are more focused on the performances, which are variable. Dennis Hopper, as the resident psychopath, really goes out a limb and performs his role with gusto; it's an overscaled, though admittedly singular achievement, yet also a horribly unpleasant one, and you can't shake Hopper away once he's off-screen (and when he returns, so do the bad vibes). The film's surreal, daydreamy mood is well-captured, as is the nightmare-in-the-daytime ambiance, but the picture's atmosphere has to go a long way towards making "Blue Velvet" worth watching again. It just hasn't held up. ** from **** I admit it. Maybe this will rather say something about myself, than the movie, but I thought "Blue Velvet" was very funny. There is some trivia here on IMDb, that says Lynch was laughing uncontrollably at the first scene between Rossellini and Hopper. I totally understand that. While I wasn't laughing uncontrollably, I was quite amused. And that feeling held on throughout the whole movie. In part this is a classic detective mystery story twisted through Lynch's unique sense for shaping reality. Indeed, what we see here can be recognized as reality, just with a little spin. Lynch's Spin. There is a lot of horror in "Blue Velvet". In fact, this movie has some serious undertones bubbling up and revealing themselves. It's a game of cover and reveal, illusion and disillusion. But although the main story line is tragic in many ways, "Blue Velevet" never becomes that. It's always kind of removed from the horror. Maybe it's because of the absurdity of some scenes. Definitely it's because of the script, the dialogue and the characters which represent classic roles with some lynchian oddity attached to them. What can I say? "Blue Velvet" is worth a visit. It's straightforward and not as twisted as later movies by Lynch and I believe the director would agree, that it is supposed to be positive, enjoyable movie. One can feel that he himself did certainly enjoy making it. How can you fault this movie? It makes an impact now. What kind of an impact must it have made in 1986. You can keep your Breakfast Club and St Elmos Fire this is the teen flick of that decade. Who among us did not want to cut off our rivals in love's ear? Who did not resort to sniffing something to get a high (for me it was Vick's Inhaler) - This movie shows us a side to the 80s and human nature that we don't want to admit is there. This is demonstrated in the characters of Frank Booth and Jeffrey Beaumont. Given a little time Frank is the person Jeff could turn out to be. While he initially resists hitting his part time lover Dorothy, eventually he gives into it. At one point his "steady" wonders if he is a detective or a pervert. Very easy to answer that one Sandy - he's a closet fiddling pervert. Why else would he keep going back to Dorothy's apartment when he knew enough the first time that he could get killed. Answer - both he and Dorothy are made for each other - both like getting punished. There is also great humor in this movie and dialog that is so intentionally tacky it shines in it's brilliance. At the first mention of Heineken I thought "ah-ha - product placement" but it is the Heineken that is Jeff's downfall. It fills his bladder and being the squeaky clean boy he is he flushes the toilet thereby not hearing Sandy's warning honks. He also enrages Frank to the point of killing him when he lets slip it's his beer of choice. The Twin Peaks links are many. Besides the actors we have the small Pacific NW logging town, the squeaky clean Sandy in her perfect bedroom - she could be Laura Palmer's room mate. The sugar and spice dialog about the robins - the final one looking like the clockwork toy from Mary Poppins. Arlene's diner is like the Double R. We hear Julie Cruise singing: "The Mysteries of Love" (labelled as "woman" in the subtitles) - corrupt cops, deviant sex, the list goes on. It was some achievement getting this into the cinemas - how then did Lynch get ABC to do Peaks? "Any previous films Mr Lynch, to give us an idea of your work?" Lynch: "Yes well I did this thing called Blue Velvet, Peaks will be very much like that except this time everyone will get to see it" Can't wait to watch it again on Blueray. Ethan & Joel Coen's "Blood Simple" & David Lynch's "Blue Velvet". I've always associated these two wonderful films with one another. Partly because they're somewhat similar, and partly because I saw them for the first time back to back. Sometime in the late eighties a friend recommended them both to me at the same time, so I rented and watched them together a short time after. Back then I didn't associate movies with directors or screenwriters, so I was totally unaware of the fact that these were to become a group of my all time favorite filmmaker's.<br/><br/>Both of these flicks can be accurately categorized in the mystery / suspense genres and both illustrate, very eloquently, how to make the most with the least. Meaning, they were very successful, in their own right, and were obviously made with modest budgets. Both are very dark and mildly comedic. They were made in the mid-eighties and at the present time, they are rated equally on this website. "Blood Simple" has a mind-boggling plot and story line that are driven by jealousy, greed, and fear. This was not only the Coen's first feature length film; it was the first for their find and eventual Oscar Winner, Francis McDormand. I'd love to know what she was paid for this flick versus some of her recent work. That, in itself, may be mind boggling.<br/><br/>This one has a surprise waiting around every corner, and at the end, when everything comes unraveled all at once, it's almost beyond comprehension. In fact, I wasn't completely sold on it until I heard the last, and only lines spoken between McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh. Over the years "Blue Velvet" has developed something of a cult following and Lynch was already pretty well established when it was released.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper, whose character, I'm guessing, has some serious Freudian issues, and Laura Dern, the sweet innocent high schooler, are the only two household names that appear. One of the "neatest" things about this film is the fact that, if it weren't for some of the clothing and automobiles, you would automatically assume that portions of it were set in the fifties. Quite a bit of the dialogue is purposely wooden, kind of corny, like something you'd hear on "Leave it to Beaver". When coupled with the dark elements of the film this creates and broadens an effect that becomes all the more surreal. <br/><br/>If this hadn't been the Coen's first, I would swear that these two flicks came to be with the three of them, (Lynch and the Coen Brothers), sitting around a bar 1983. David looks at The Brothers and says, "You guys couldn't produce a decent suspense thriller if I wrote it for you!" Ethan turns to Lynch and says, "How much man?! Bring it on and we'll kick you're a __ __!" And there you have it, my first monitor play. Unfortunately, these selections aren't for everyone. If you require computer graphics and explosions with your murder, these are probably a little too bland for your taste. Unfortunately, If you've become a Coen Brother's fan in this decade, based on such works as "O Brother Where Art Thou", this is not a definitive indication as to whether or not you'll enjoy these either. It's pretty simple actually, if you thought "Reservoir Dogs" was as good as, or better than "Pulp Fiction", then you're half way home. The concept of exposing a seedy underbelly underneath America's idealistic suburban utopia is not necessarily original anymore, and it certainly was not when Blue Velvet debuted back in 1986. However, it was told in such a revolutionary and no-holds-barred way that it startled people and caused an uproar. The fire and controversy that it started has long since burnt out, but it's still remained relevant and fresh to this very day. It is continually rediscovered by film buffs, leading to poignant and refreshing interpretations about what transpires in the film.<br/><br/>It's premise is simple. Jeffrey Beaumont is a handsome, unconventional and relatively well-adjusted young man with a bit of a peeping Tom thrown into the mix. His voyeuristic desires are met when he discovers a human ear in his picturesque town of Lumberton, North Carolina. Thus this lifts the lid on his 50s postcard perfect hometown. His fantasies about delving deeper into the discovery of the ear are fulfilled by a pretty and wholesome detectives daughter, Sandy Williams. The antithesis to Sandy is met when a person of interest in the ear case becomes known to Jeffrey. Her name is Dorothy Vallens and she's a sultry, beautiful and seductive lounge singer with a haunted mind. Jeffrey learns more by sneaking into her apartment and observing her at a comfortable distance (in her wardrobe) and the voyeur in him is unleashed, a-la Rear Window. Through Dorothy, he meets Frank Booth, a depraved man who is holding her child ransom and may or may not hold the key to the ear, or the answer as to where it came from.<br/><br/>I will not divulge much else. Like I said, the premise is relatively simple until about an hour in when it starts to get dark and dangerous. The idea of Blue Velvet could be traced back to Hitchcock, who also had a keen fascination with voyeurism, and perhaps even The Night of the Hunter, which also exposed the darkness of small town America. But Blue Velvet really is in a league all of its own, with some stellar acting, unforgettably rich cinematography and a haunting soundtrack. The direction here is Lynch at his very best, at least until Mulholland Drive was released 15 years later in 2001. <br/><br/>Metaphors and symbolism are rampant in the film, giving it great re- watch value. It plays like a 1950s sitcom when it depicts the wholesome suburban life as a contrast to the seedy nighttime happenings of this seemingly peaceful town. I think that this film holds up as probably one of the most original visions to come out of the 1980s, certainly one of the most unforgettable too. Even in this day and age, where shock value is the media norm, it's still as haunting as it was many moons ago in 1986. You either love it, or hate it. But one thing's for sure, it's not supposed to all make sense. This is David Lynch's finest hour in film directing, and it's lived on as an absolutely outrageous classic. It's a mystery, it's a romance, it's a thriller, it's a horror film, it's a potato. It's anything you want it to be, and more. Those who just never got it just can't seem to get a hold of the fact that this is a David Lynch picture. He's not as much a filmmaker, as he is an artist. He's the Salvador Dali of moving images. They say that sometimes you must suspend disbelief while watching a movie. Well, suspend all belief in a David Lynch movie. I was taken on quite the "thrill ride" with this one. It had me laughing, then wincing, then completely annoyed. The only part of the picture that left me cold was that phony romance between Jeffery and Sandy. It's supposed to be apart of the sick 50's Americana vision of love, as Lynch juxtaposes it with society's dark underbelly, but it just didn't entertain me. I guess that's what so fascinating about Blue Velvet. It grabs you're attention, eye's wide open, and then it slows completely down and gets under your skin. God help me, this stuff is just wonderful to me in the end. It seems like Blue Velvet has had the same effect Eraserhead on me. I didn't have the same strong physiological reaction to Blue Velvet, but I sort of have the same psychological effect, in the sense that I can't stop thinking about it. I finished watching Blue Velvet last night but it feels as if I haven't gone to sleep. When I was lying in bed all I could think about was Blue Velvet and I even had a dream about Blue Velvet. Waking up now, all I can still think about is Blue Velvet! I was painfully excited to see it. David Lynch happens to be my favourite director of all time, and Blue Velvet always seems to get rave reviews even from people who aren't fans of Lynch.<br/><br/>I was pumping myself up for Blue Velvet so much. I planned exactly when I was going to watch it and prepared my own mental countdown to the day. Watching a new film by David Lynch is a massive event for me, because you can only see his films once. I can never watch Mulholland Dr. (my favourite Lynch film, and one of my favourite ever films period) the same bemused way I watched it the first time. I can't put my excitement into words when I actually popped the disc in and was getting ready to press 'Play Movie'. What followed was 2 hours of me looking awe-struck.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a masterpiece and quite possibly the best thriller I've ever seen. If any other director was given a story like this in the 80's then they would've made it exceedingly bland and conventional. However, in the hands of our God (David Lynch) he has created a thoroughly absorbing and seductive piece of work which can proudly sit with his other insane masterpieces. Blue Velvet is definitely one of his more linear works. It's easy to understand (though not as shockingly normal as The Elephant Man or The Straight Story) yet it still evokes a sense of power and magic you can't put into words.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the brilliant opening which lifts a beautiful blue curtain to reveal a bright and beautiful American town (not dissimilar to Twin Peaks) only to then change its tone rapidly by depicting a man having a stroke. The camera then mesmerising pushes through the green grass to reveal a dark and revolting world where bugs crawl. This is of course the basis of the film. Not everything is as it seems, and what goes on behind closed doors can be more disturbing than anything you can imagine. As Geoffrey and Sandy say throughout the film, "it's a strange world." <br/><br/>The film begins as a chirpy mystery. It evokes the atmosphere of a 50's noir with the fantastic dramatic music and simple mystery plot. It also has the innocent love interest, Laura Dern, who is brilliant here as she is in Wild at Heart and Inland Empire, although Inland Empire features undoubtedly her greatest performance. The mystery begins when Geoffrey (Kyle Maclachlan, playing almost the same character as detective Dale Cooper) finds a human ear on his walk home. There's a fantastic wholesome quality about Geoffrey. He seems like the innocent young lad who's after a bit of adventure. This makes it all the more interesting when the mystery becomes so intense that it starts showing a darker side to Geoffrey's character.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a gripping yarn, but it becomes all the more gripping when Geoffrey starts hiding in the apartment of the mysterious singer, Dorothy (wonderfully played by Isabella Rossellini). I don't want to spoil what happens because it's one of the greatest moments in the film. It's when the atmosphere turns from being innocent and lively to unbelievably dark and disturbing. It's a classic Lynch scene which feels very nightmarish and dreamlike as it's very long and drawn-out, which in turn sucks you in. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, even though what was happening was not pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>You might've guessed that the scene in question features Dennis Hopper as the legendary Frank Booth. Here Dennis is a deranged mass of energy, not too dissimilar to Day Lewis' immortal Daniel Plainview, only Booth is less calculating. He's a frightening sado-masochist who reacts purely on instinct and bizarrely inhales some sort of gas when he gets himself worked up. Obviously this performance was far too daring and memorable for the academy as Hopper wasn't even up for a gong!<br/><br/>Lynch brilliantly puts the audience in the shoes of Geoffrey. We feel ourselves becoming more and more sucked in to the mystery and succumbing to the seductive and hypnotic dreamlike atmosphere. The film probably reaches its disturbing peak when Booth takes Geoffrey for a joyride and we're introduced to his strange and psychotic friends. The lip-synch to 'In Dreams' is just classic Lynch and so beautifully haunting.<br/><br/>Whilst Blue Velvet isn't quite as wonderfully layered or as surreal as Mulholland Drive or Inland Empire, it's still an incredibly piece of work. This is the work of a true magician who has a passion for Hollywood's golden age and is desperate to revive it, whilst still adding his own distinctive brush strokes. David Lynch is one of the few directors who realises that film is an art and when done correctly, it can take you on a mesmerising journey and evoke feelings and emotions you didn't know you had. Blue Velvet is a beautiful film with incredible music and a moving ending. It's one of the greatest films I've seen. There are some movies that reminisce on the "olden, golden days", the movies that look back at what we do not have anymore, a time period that has vanished before us. Blue Velvet does not do this. Instead, it makes us look at what we failed to see, or at what we saw a glimpse of and turned our backs against. It must be, in this case, a version of the "real" world. There are murderers, there are pain-aholics, there are those who pretend to do good while secretly smiling only to themselves. David Lynch knows that some of us prefer not to look at this side. It is easier to shut our eyes. With this film, Mr. Lynch makes us open our eyes (almost) as wide as they can go. It is a disturbing experience.<br/><br/>When asked to give a rating, I gave this a four out of five. By Netflix standards, this means I "really liked it." That is not true. I wanted to only give it three stars, but that would mean I "liked it." That expression is too dull for my ears. I liked it. Just liked it, as if I could just shrug either way. No, I neither liked it nor really liked it nor did I hate it. It was a film that I may not ever see again, but I am glad that I have now seen.<br/><br/>Why? Some films glorify violence. The creators show naked women and naked men to "show how wrong" something is, whether it be an action or a gesture or a slam towards a particular sex. This film really does just want to show something about the world, but it neither wants to claim it as being "right" or "wrong." The phrase, "It's a strange world" is repeated multiple times throughout the film. This is what the director most likely wants us to think: that we live in strange times filled with strange people doing strange thing. It is up to us to decide whether or not this fits with our moral code. Among this line are other redundant or seemingly off lines. The script is not the main attraction to the film. If one only read the script (which I did first before seeing the film), it would be easy, although untrue, to say that the film is horribly written. Somehow, though, with the exception of a few scenes (most notably the one where Jeffery tells Sandy what he saw when following a murderer and Sandy replies by giving him a vivid account of a dream she had in which robins flew around happily and represented beauty in the world), the script does work and make sense for the situations. It is fantastic directing from Mr. Lynch.<br/><br/>Just like Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead, sound plays a large role and accounts for many of the creepy scenes. A fair amount of suspense is generated by playing sounds of strange noise in the background of select scenes. It sounds very mystical and somewhat dangerous, which does add tremendous amounts to the film.<br/><br/>While I hate to say it, the style beats the substance here. It should not be the case, but it is. Some reviewers have said that they felt like the film constantly went from humor to darkness to humor again. I did not see any humor whatsoever (although I have only seen one viewing.) Instead, I felt like some of the images of the blue water and the blue sky and the sounds of a Donna show just added to the irony of the situation. After all, there is a murder/crime trying to be solved, and yet people can still wake up to the "cool, jazzy" sounds of the Lumberton radio? And it is those small details that really summarize the film as a whole. There will always be those who whistle and those who kill, always those who do good and those who do bad. There is no resolution or explanation of why people do the things they do. Because this was the case for all of the characters, I did not feel cheated at the end. By not telling us, we are less able to judge (or are we more able?) and are more likely to think about it long after it is over. A fair warning to all those who have not yet seen it: you will never be able to hear the song "Blue Velvet" in the same way again. "Blue Velvet" is a take on film noir with typical Lynch weirdness, unique atmosphere and breathtaking cinematic work. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) comes home from college to visit his sick and bed-ridden father who had a tragic accident. Having made a startling discovery (to be more exact, a human ear lying in the grass), out of sheer boredom and driven by passion for adventure Jeffrey decides to proceed with this mystery and gets involved with a night-club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) living in a shabby apartment building, which is somewhat incongruous to the sleepy suburban paradise of Lumberton. <br/><br/>Dorothy, a queer mixture, of "damsel in distress" and "femme fatale", is in a middle of a life and death situation involving her husband and son. She is subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of violence by a psychopathic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and his demented associates. Jeffrey's further investigation reveals that one of the police detectives is also involved in the criminal activities of the gang, and that means that he will have to deal with these people using his own resources. He confides in Sandy, a good-natured and sweet blonde, whose father is a hard-working and honest policeman. Sandy is obviously fascinated by Jeffrey's recklessness, but her level-headed nature prevents her from becoming his full-time accomplice and ditching her boy-friend, at least, not until later on. <br/><br/>Stylistically, Blue Velvet is a precursor to Lynch's notorious collaboration with Mark Frost - TV series "Twin Peaks". These creations share a lot of elements including the small town setting, a dangerously attractive brunette, oldies often played under disturbing circumstances, dreamy angel-like singers (remember Julie Cruise in Twin Peaks), flame and even the famous red curtains. Although "Blue Velvet" is just a thriller without any supernatural context, somehow you expect the Dwarf to pop up and start dancing at any time. <br/><br/>The blue velvet is a leitmotif of the film. "Blue Velvet" is a song that Dorothy has to perform in a club every night looking straight in the eyes of her tormentors. Dorothy also wears a blue velvet gown at home, and Frank has a fetish for blue velvet using it in his perverted sexual games. Blue velvet is a symbol of mystery, obsession and hidden passions lurking beneath the exterior of men. <br/><br/>Lynch uses different colors for the scenes taking place in the normal world of American suburbia versus Dorothy's apartment or Ben's house. Lumbertown is depicted as idyllic joyful place with bright yellow tulips against the white fence and bright green grass. Everything involving Dorothy or the criminals is shot either in the darkness or unnaturally striking colors. The director makes an interesting application of the contrast between the two women in protagonist's life. Dangerous and seductive Dorothy is a voluptuous brunette wearing blue or red gowns, whereas Sandy is a slender blonde, your typical American next door cheerleader. <br/><br/>Kyle MacLahlan is cute, adorable and gives an incredibly convincing performance. His love-making scenes with Rossellini are tasteful, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Rosselini was quite adequate, especially if we take into account the complexity of the character, but I couldn't get rid of this thought in the back of my head that Sherilyn Fenn would have been much more memorable. Perhaps, I am irreparably spoiled by Twin Peaks... However, Rossellini's was Lynch's favorite at the time, so we can understand being a little bit biased here. Dennis Hopper is way over the top as Frank Booth, being psychotic, violent and pitiful at the same time. His every appearance on the screen is a an avalanche of emotions, swear-words and craziness. He is a dangerous man and Jeffrey who stepped in his way knows that the only way for him to stay alive is to eliminate Frank. <br/><br/>Lynch decided to end this flick on a joyful note. Everything goes back to normal in Lumberton, Jeffrey and Sandy will probably go on to have a long and wholesome life together with children on the way. Dorothy is hugging her son in the final moments of the movie, and the robin as the symbol of good is devouring the bug just as in Sandy's dream. However, despite the obviously happy ending and triumph of the good over the evil, the final scenes have such a dream-like and surreal quality that one cannot help suspecting that something bad is doomed to happen again. With Lynch you never know for sure... I make it a point to see hundreds of films from virtually every genre, and I judge them good or bad primarily on the basis of how convincing the acting is, how believable the plot line, and whether or not the film generally avoids kitsch and cliché. Like most people, I usually agree with the critics (except when they seem to under- or overrate a film based on colleagues' opinions), and it was Blue Velvet's widely positive reviews that moved me to see it.<br/><br/>I have never been left so convinced of critics' tendency to jump on the overrating bandwagon. Overall, the film is atrocious, with it's absolutely last-rate acting being its worst feature. I'll never forget a few of the more glaring examples of hokum, including a scene when McLachlan's character turns to his sweetheart and begs, "Why, Sandy? Why are there people like (Dennis Hopper's villainous character) Frank in this world? Why oh why?!" Or the numerous instances when Laura Dern's character insists -- through halting sobs -- to go along on Jeffrey's oh-so-dangerous detective missions ("No, Sandy! It's TOO dangerous! I care about you TOO much!").<br/><br/>Exists purely to shock. And that's all it does. Pretentious and overrated. Blue Velvet is marked by the traits of David Lynch's other successful films: abstract visuals, strange characters, unpredictability, and plots that require imagination. In order to like this, you will likely need to have patience with understanding what is happening in the film. Of course, this is a murder mystery, so the answers are expected to be hidden until the end. However, with Lynch the answers remain hidden even after that! With enough thought, you could come up with satisfying interpretations, but you just have to accept these things when you view the film.<br/><br/>One of the most striking parts of Blue Velvet is the characterization. Frank (played by Dennis Hopper) is one of the most remarkable villains I have ever known. The Yellow Man and Ben are mysterious characters that do not have much screen time, but are performed perfectly during those scenes. And don't forget Dorothy, who gives an effective performance as their victim. In contrast to these ludicrous gangsters, the other characters are caricatures of average people. Jeffrey is the ambitious young man returning home and searching for adventure, Sandy is the typical girl companion, and Detective Williams is her protective father.<br/><br/>I think that the reason that Blue Velvet works for me is because the premise is simple, but the way that it is presented introduces ambiguity. There are layers of loosely connected themes and motifs, which makes it perfect for repeated viewings and analysis. Different people will see different things in it. From my experience, Blue Velvet gets a strong recommendation. If you like artistic and intriguing films, especially ones with memorable characters, then don't miss this one. David Lynch's kinky 1986 classic Blue Velvet has always been one of my favourite films, and some 23 years on since it's release, it's still as raw, powerful and beautiful as ever. Its disguised as a simple noir mystery, but actually operates on a number of complex plots and stories, it's all about what lies beneath. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is a young man living in an idyllic, typical American town. One day, after discovering a severed human ear in a field, Jeffrey invokes the police, but they remain idle. He decides to investigate the case on his own, with the help of detective William's daughter Sandy (Laura Dern), only to be thrown into a dark underworld beneath their small, seemingly innocent village.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet's story is, in essence and in contrast with Lynch's other works, quite straightforward. There are no supernatural beings, no dream worlds, and time linearly flows forward. The real beauty of this film is the strong imagery: colorful roses against an immaculate white fence, darkly lit corridors, unsettlingly tidy apartment rooms. The actors' performances are all simply great. For example, MacLachlan's character is convincingly innocentor maybe exactly the opposite. However, every single character is blown out of the water by Dennis Hopper, who plays a disturbingly psychotic and evil characterprobably Hopper's all-time best role.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet contains quite a bit of music. Most noticeable is Bobby Vinton's song after which the film is named, but there is also Roy Orbison's In Dreams, used in a scene that won't get out of your head once you've seen it.<br/><br/>It is striking that some scenes have no music at all, leaving them open to interpretation. In scenes with music, the score, composed by Angelo Badalamenti, greatly contributes to the film's atmosphere. In other words, music is used carefully but effectively.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is probably Lynch's masterpiece. This film will slowly drag you down, and won't release its grip until long after you've finished watching this movie. A must-see, although it may be hard to stomach for the faint-hearted, it's no family movie. It's a dark, disturbing masterpiece that is arguably Lynch's finest film to date. It is a powerful exploration of the evil underbelly that lurks beneath a wholesome facade of small-town America. After hearing so much about "Blue Velvet" I was very disappointed. Sitting down to watch it, I knew it would be a bizarre experience and had heard that it was quite disturbing; however, I have a strong stomach.<br/><br/>What I don't like about "Blue Velvet" is that it seems like exploitation. It didn't "disturb" me but I didn't enjoy it, feel comfortable watching it, and was appalled by Lynch's directorial decisions. The scene in which Dennis Hopper uses his oxygen mask goes on too long, and is too explicit and sick and depraved.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't care if this is a "satire" of our world. I've read that it's supposed to be an examination of the evil that lurks beneath suburban America. That it's all a dream in the protagonist's head. Etc. However, in order to stress this, Lynch did not need to resort to some of the over-the-top, excessive elements that he used.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was sub-par, all except for Hopper, but then again his character is so revolting it's hard to enjoy the performance, even as a villain. The script is weak - I laughed every time Laura Dern spoke, her lines are so cheesy and typical.<br/><br/>Overall this really isn't a very good movie in my opinion. "American Beauty" and even "The 'burbs" (yes, that's right, "The 'burbs") did a better job of examining the undercurrents of suburban life. "Blue Velvet" is not an entertaining movie. It is sick, excessive, with bad acting and writing, which makes me wonder if its single redeeming value -- its supposed "satirical edge" -- is really worth the means? I don't think so. Funs of Lynch, i am so sorry but blue velvet is ..hmm.. Kitsch!! I was watching that movie and i was wondering which is the deep meaning of it(!)and as hard as i tried to find out it, i didn't! I felt that i wasted my time!Jeffrey was a young man who suddenly decided to become Inspector Gadget! He fell in love with a young girl, but he was making love with a "strange" woman!No logic, no humor, no adventure, no no no no.... Just blue velvet!....She wore blue velvet Bluer than velvet was the night Softer than satin was the light...nice song, i had to hear it for ages!At least, can someone explain to me what happened with Jefreys fathers health? I would appreciate it a lot! Okay, so I liked "Dune". That was a very cool Sci-Fi movie....... but "Blue Velvet"?<br/><br/>Is David Lynch insane or what? I can't believe the content of "Blue Velvet"...<br/><br/>I never want to meet Dennis Hopper, for fear that he might be even remotely like the character "Frank Booth". His mouth... my goodness, that mouth of his!!! It seems as though his vocabulary is very limited beyond the word "f**k".<br/><br/>I shoulda gone by my gut feeling and not asked my mom to rent that movie. But, no, I still wanted to see it for the simple reason that Dean Stockwell was in it.<br/><br/>I watched the entire movie just to have Dean in a scene no more than ten minutes long? Sure, I coulda stopped the movie after his scene, but I didn't know if he had any more than that one. Plus, yes, I must admit that I was actually curious as to how everything was going to work out in the end.<br/><br/>I got a kick outta Dean's performance, though. I was laughing through the entire thing. Especially when "Ben" indulged "Frank" by toasting to "f**king". That surprised me... but then I laughed to tears because it was so absurd!!!<br/><br/>I can't even say that Dean's awesome performance as the suave "Ben" made up for the awful content of the rest of that horrible movie.<br/><br/>This movie deserves nothing more than *0* stars out of 10, but because of Dean's performance, I'll be lenient and give it a *1*. As much as I loved Dean's portrayal of "Ben", I'll stick to watching Dean as "Al Calavicci" in "Quantum Leap". david lynch's highly stylized vision & masterful camera work cannot rescue the predictable plot and b-movie acting of this mediocre film. it's embarrassing to watch isabella rossellini, an underappreciated beauty, meandering naked while blabbering contrived nonsense -- and hers may be the best acting in this film. dennis hopper is his vintage, annoyingly over-the-top self, or perhaps maclachlan & dern's stiffness only make him seem so animated. the poor acting and slow-moving plot only make the predictable ending even more unbearable. lynch is certainly an artist, but this is not one of his better works. when the best part of a film is the soundtrack, you're better off buying the OST than the DVD. This movie has become notorious or should I should say Roger Ebert has become notorious. This is the highest rated movie ever made that Ebert gave one star to. This has a 94% on RottenTomatoes and what do you know? I happen to be among the 94% who like it. This is David Lynch's best movie and it's actually one of the least surreal. All of the characters are so likeable in this.<br/><br/>You have the main character, Jeffrey who falls in love with two women. What's amazing is that they manage to make both of these women very likeable characters. It's to the point where you don't really care which one he ends up with as it's a win-win situation. Frank Booth played by Dennis Hopper is simply amazing. What makes this villain so effective is that he's literally the only character who says the f-word except for literally ONE instance and that's by someone who's paraphrasing him! This is a great way of using bad language effectively. It makes the villain all the more menacing.<br/><br/>I believe there was a magazine (possibly "Empire"?) that ranked this as the best movie of the 1980's. Well, they listed a bunch of movies and this was the highest ranked one from the 1980's. It's in fact the best film I've seen for Cult Month. It starts off by showing a severed ear. That's quite a funny coincidence as I just saw "The Fly" which had a scene where Jeff Goldblum's ear came off. Hey, it was Jeff Goldblum's ear! **** I think that it's very understandable to hate this film but it seems that a lot of the hate is based on misunderstanding.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned in some of the negative reviews the plot is somewhat 'straight forward'and has elements of the twee, Hardy Boys- esque aesthetic. This is clearly a deliberate stylistic choice and, as a result makes the surreal, distorted imagery (Lynch's specialty) more pronounced.<br/><br/>The reviewers who might say something like "well, that's only an interpretation" I'd say, watch his other films and you can see that -especially comparing this with Eraserhead for example - Lynch deliberately distorts reality to give that 'uneasy' or 'unpleasant' feeling. If you also consider this film and compare it with Elephant Man you can see he is also able to create a much more accessible rags-to-riches story with a main character full of pathos and subtle emotion.<br/><br/>So, I think that people mistakenly call the acting 'over the top' or call the violence or language 'too much' but they miss the point that that in fact IS the point.<br/><br/>That being said even if you do understand all that it is still completely understandable to say, "this movie isn't for me". This is where Lynch begins essentially. Red drapes, sultry women, quirky or menacing figures, latenight encounters in spooky places. Rooms that hum with strange presence, always these rooms. It's the most potent and exhilarating world we've had in a generation, isn't it?<br/><br/>You can see how Lumberton would become Twin Peaks, the zoom-out from Jeffrey's ear in the daydreamed ending become the opening of Mulholland, In Dreams become the Club Silencio scene, Stockwell's place with these morose figures in the room turn into the Rabbits sequence in Empire. You can of course see how Frank would become Bob and you'll know all about Bob's true nature if you listen to Frank repeat Orbison's lyrics in the woods here.<br/><br/>It is not yet the big, abstract fish he would reel in later, but that would come. I didn't like it the first time I saw it; tame by comparison to later Lynch, too cartoony, Frank not menacing enough, some silly acting. Lynch's whole career has been variations of the same world after all but with more and more deeply submerged causality.<br/><br/>All the same, this is Lynch's first work that comes from meditation (as opposed to merely imagination). To my knowledge, he had fallen in with 'transcendental meditation' in his AFI years, while making Eraserhead. That was feverish work about personal angst imagined in a painter's studio, as removed from meditation as can be. He then took on a couple of films that weren't really his and don't take place in his red- draped world. <br/><br/>He was still in his 20s however and meanwhile I believe he was incubating the world that he would first express here. What's meditative here? It's the vibrant world of present moment, the sense of mystery full of bliss. I love the first latenight walk between them in the sleepy neighborhood with quiet trees looming overhead. I love how he hides in Dorothy's apartment and we peer through blinds into strange happenings. It floats with youth discovering a big strange world out there and the urge to penetrate its myriad guises.<br/><br/>But it's better revealed as meditative if you come to see how this is all the illusory world of the mind (the mind that desires and wanders into rooms). This is Lynch going beyond drapes and drowsy mood to give engine to the dreaming, in-sight about the self who is draped in himself.<br/><br/>A boy has a crush on a girl who's with someone else. This is deliberately to introduce inner dissonance in Jeffrey (who we understand is a basically decent person), but Lynch gives us one more reason for stress just the same. His father is in the hospital. A more abstract one is that he's a young boy who can't yet make love align with desire, the pure with the primal.<br/><br/>At any rate something's not quite right in his world and needs to be settled by self-discovery, snooping around to see yourself when no one's there. Far from being feared (as sin or neurosis), this dissonance inside of us is opportunity for knowledge and wisdom (and this too is meditative).<br/><br/>So we get two women, one pure, the other primal, and a narrator who succumbs to noir hallucination (notably as a spell cast by the femme fatale's song). Jeffrey succumbs to desire (Dorothy) which unleashes a destructive ego that only expects to be pleased (Frank), but that ego is a petulant child masking with anger the need for affection.<br/><br/>Lynch would top himself a couple of times for my taste but it all begins here. A swim where the swimmer is the river itself. It's hard for me to choose my personal favorite among Lynch's films, but Blue Velvet surely holds a special place inside my heart. Not only because it's a beautiful movie that never ceases to amaze me and whomever I may watch it with, but also because it was my entrance door to the fantastic world of Mr. Lynch - very much like the ear Jeffrey finds, which opens a portal to all of the sub sequential events, something he never thought would happen in his suburban life.<br/><br/>As of interpretations on the "meaning" of the story and certain views presented, I believe Lynch is very wise to state that the audience should come up with a meaning to all of that by themselves. I particularly love movies that will leave me wondering about what I've just watched, so I have to trust my own perceptions and thoughts on the story, because eventually, people will somehow take a movie they love personally. Not that I wouldn't care if someday Lynch came along and said this movie was about "this or that", after all, ideas have sources, but even though, I never would be able to shake off my personal view on the movie, as anyone else wouldn't either. It may not seem so, but a movie affects us very personally, on an unconscious level, even.<br/><br/>That's one of the keys to Blue Velvet's plot, in my opinion. Lynch is known to work with our innermost fantasies and reveries, and the colors he uses, the nuances and subtleties left open in certain scenes, everything works in the sense of leading us to doubt our own senses - for example, the red curtain moving in Dorothy's apartment - it is never revealed to us if she and Jeffrey were really alone at that moment, but does the answer actually matter? Lynch already succeed in instigating and shaking our balances on what reality is concerned. Also, there's a genius reflection on our humanly impulses of watching - voyeurism - and to be watched, something close to exhibitionism. It's easy to empathize with Kyle's character, the attraction to mystery and transgressive acts are common to us all, as well as the secret observation of someone else's intimacy, to which the movie-watching is a prototype.<br/><br/>Apart from all the great performances featured, Dennis Hopper's interpretation of Frank is by far, the most fascinating. No matter how many times I watch it, his intensity and rawness always amaze me, and leave me wanting to know more about the character; his past, his motivations. The first time we meet him, there's no doubt about his mental instability, and all of the following scenes seem to testify to that. In later viewings, though, it struck me that besides being dangerous, the gas inhalation to reach euphoria and his unsettling Oedipus complex, he's also a man in love. Yes, it may be considered a sick and aggressive love by our society standards, but it is, nevertheless, love. What else would explain his emotional reactions to the songs (both Blue Velvet and In Dreams)? One more thing, I absolutely love Laura Dern, and in this movie she conveys the perfect American dream girl - pretty, tender, slightly witty and malleable - a very interesting counterpoint to Dorothy Vallen's more sexual, assertive and mature persona. Jeffrey is seduced by both sides, but in the end, he chooses to be with the robins. As the camera zooms out of the severed ear at the end, we are told that the nightmare is over, the moments where our unconscious urges could be disclosed is over, and once again, we take a peek at the maggots breeding under the well mowed lawn, only this time, the insect is being crushed by the bird. Let us talk of serendipity ... amateur detective activism by serendipity !<br/><br/>why would you spot a cut ear in your neighborhood ... serendipity ! why would a detective live in your neighborhood with a pretty daughter ready for dating with you .. serendipity ! along with dating why would she agree to become your associate in the most bizarre outburst of detective creativity ... serendipity of course stupid ! what an idea of dating BTW !! in your first crime detection foray why would you find a key resting in the kitchen table which happens to be exactly the key needed to open the doors ... serendipity honey ! all this and followed by more and more windfall of luck. one would be sufficient to make James Bond happy !<br/><br/>usually in any movie with such a plot you would laugh hysterically. this dud of a movie does not even manage to induce a smile ... only long yawns. strictly avoidable fare. looks old and jaded too in addition to being a soporific crime thriller.<br/><br/>one recommendation though - look for the expression in the face of the detective when he is first informed about the cut ear ... you would be forgiven to think as if he himself committed the crime. Before Little Children, before American Beauty, there was Blue Velvet, and American masterpiece of it's time. I came across this movie a couple years ago, but I wasn't too sure about it, but it was recommended in my 1001 movies you must see before you die book. Not to mention that I like Dennis Hopper, so when I noticed that he was in this movie, I got a little more excited to pick it up. In some ways I'm glad I waited to see Blue Velvet, just because I don't think I could have appreciated it like I do since I'm a little older. While I do think it's a bit over rated than what I was led on to believe; this was still a very memorizing film with incredible performances. The story is so dark and disturbing, just proving that the most perfect little town has it's very dark and scary secrets.<br/><br/>Jeffrey has come home to his very sweet little home where it is on the bound of leave it to beaver style of families and friends. But unfortunately, his father had a heart attack and is in the hospital, so Jeffrey is left on his own, while he's walking home from the hospital, he comes across a disembodied human ear, brings it to the local detective. He meets the detective's daughter, Sandy, and together they think they can solve this crime. It leads them to a woman, Dorothy, who is a singer, and makes Jeffrey into her lover, but he learns that a messed up druggie, Frank, has her in a deep hold of dark secrets and leads him into a life that he never expected.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was the silent success of 1986, not to mention a first of it's kind for movies. It was kinda like one of those "look closer" films, that was pretty rare for it's time. If you enjoyed American Beauty or Little Children, I would highly recommend this movie without hesitation. The acting and whole look of the story was so memorizing. The only thing was that the story did work, but it still had an empty feeling at the end for me. I just felt like it could have had a better introduction. But over all the film picked up and this is a good one, folks.<br/><br/>8/10 This rating is probably inflated due to the name David Lynch and the respect I have for some movies he directed, such as Eraserhead and Elephant Man.
The way the plot was constructed was simply inexcusable, with 0 to no logic. Some aspects I feel were just fillers and had no consequences whatsoever, basically pointless. I am talking about Jeff's father being injured and just remaining umentioned for the rest of the movie. Sandy's boyfriend whose only somewhat relevant appearence is in the end as well, when he tails Jeff and Sandy because he is jealous, but then that scene becomes irrelevant and nothing happens to Jess because they find the singer injured in that particular location for no reason. And the one which bothers me the most is when the singer confesses Jeff is her secret lover, Sandy cries about it but then forgives him. WHY DID THAT SCENE HAPPEN? If the answer is some corny pretentious symbolism, spare me. Also, the dialogues were so underwelming, unnatural, almost ressembling 7th grade play (written by the students). I honestly don't know how this movie has 2 hours, as so many interesting aspects, such as the relationship between the singer and his son and her husband, hell, he could have dedicated some time to explaining the singer's situation, we just learn about it through an assumption Jeff pulled out of his ass and happened to be 100% accurate. Also, the vast majority of the characters, such as the son and the husband, are only mentioned very superficially.
I kind of think that most of the hype around this comes from the shock value of the sordid, violent sex scenes, and the waky crazy Frank (another character who was so superfitial and lazily constructed around the fact he is a maniac).
The visuals are very impressive, but that doesn't change anything about the frankly medíocre, at best, plot of this movie. Sometimes you finish watching a film and this question comes to your mind: why did this one become a success? This is the first thought that came to my mind after I watched the Blue Velvet. Typical story, quite weak actually. A young man gets involved into a dangerous case, soon realizes he can't escape, applies the law and at the end he almost disbands the gang by himself with the help of the police and his girlfriend (of course). This whole thing with the weirdly perverted criminals and the eccentric characters is a hopeless endeavor to make the story look sophisticated but at the end it rather looks ridiculous. All this information is actually useless as it does nothing to enrich the plot. Just another drop in the ocean of overrated films. Still the question remains: why did this film (hundreds of similar films as well) get so much attention and success? David Lynch's Blue Velvet is an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece and is one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with brilliant direction,great acting and a beautiful and haunting score Blue Velvet is David Lynch at his best.<br/><br/>Set in the fictional town of Lumberton,U.S.A,Blue Velvet tells the story of a young man named Jeffrey Beaumont(Kyle MacLachlan)who has just returned home from college to see his Father in the hospital because his Father has just had a stroke. While in town,Jeffrey finds a severed ear in a backyard which leads into a dark mystery involving disturbed singer Dorothy Vallens(Isabella Rossellini)who is being held captive by sadistic criminal Frank Booth(Dennis Hopper). With the help from neighbor and friend Sandy(Laura Dern)Jeffrey is pulled into a dark and unsettling world which will change his life forever.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a masterpiece that was a strange and different experience for cinema when it came out in 1986. When it came out audiences either loved it or were confused by it,critics were divided by the film where some critics called it a masterpiece while other critics hated it. In 1986 as well as the entire decade of the 80s was dominated by Hollywood Blockbusters and Independent cinema was more underground and Blue Velvet did not fit into either camp of a Hollywood Blockbuster or an independent film but in the camp of a David Lynch film. One of the reasons Blue Velvet is a great film and one of the greatest films ever made is because when you are watching the film you are pulled into a world of strange surrealism which Lynch is a master of. BV is a Film-Noir,but a new kind-of Film-Noir where instead of taking place of a big city BV takes place in the safe haven of the suburbs. In this film the suburbs and the small town is portrayed as a nice,calm beautiful place where there is nothing wrong but underneath the beauty is dark and disturbing world where danger is around every corner. BV gives viewers a Mystery where the characters are threatened by violence and sex and is so perverse that as a viewer you want to look away but you just can't. BV is a brilliant film that pulls you into a experience or trip into a world of darkness and disturbing weirdness and as you watch the film you are truly mesmerized while at the same time you are frightened by what you are watching and it's an experience you will never forget. BV is an amazing film that not only challenges you physically but mentally as well because when you watch the film there some moments where you as the viewer want to look away but you can't because you as the viewer are interested in what happens next. The character Jeffrey is pretty much like us the viewers who are watching these events go on and can't really understand why these things are happening. Like Jeffrey we are asking why does a person like Frank Booth exist and why is there so much trouble in this world? Jeffrey is a great character because in the beginning Jeffrey is just a typical young man who is innocent and he assumes he's living in a safe Paradise,but as the film goes on Jeffrey begins losing his innocence as he continues investigates the world of Frank and Dorothy and discovers a world different from his which changes his outlook on life. Where Jeffrey represents light and good,Frank represents dark and evil. Lynch's films are paintings coming to life and Lynch gives the film beautiful and haunting imagery whether it is using different colors including red and blue or mental and physical images like fire or the violence that happens to the characters. Lynch also balances the beauty of the light and ugliness of the dark where during the daytime in the light there are beautiful images of red roses and white picket fences and in the dark of night we see disturbing things like harsh lighting and other crazy things that involve Frank and his bizarre adventures. The ending is great and is filled with suspense and cinematic beauty but feels like an amazing dream coming to life and will be in your mind after viewing the film and is one of the reasons Blve Velvet is a Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Kyle MacLachlan is excellent as Jeffrey,with MacLachlan bringing sympathy,depth and intensity to the role. Isabella Rossellini is fantastic,sexy and beautiful as tortured singer Dorothy,with Rossellini bringing sadness to the role. Dennis Hopper is brilliant and terrifying as Frank Booth,one of the greatest villains of all time. Hopper is so scary he makes you think that he is not playing Frank Booth,but he is Frank Booth. Laura Dern gives a wonderful performance as Sandy,Jeffrey's neighbor and love interest. Dean Stockwell is fantastic as Ben,a friend of Frank's. Brad Dourif(Raymond),Jack Nance(Paul),George Dickerson(Detective Williams),Hope Lange(Mrs. Williams),Priscilla Pointer(Mrs. Beaumont)and Frances Bay(Aunt Barbara)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by David Lynch is brilliant,with Lynch bringing a beautiful and surreal visual style to the film and with Lynch always moving the camera giving the film a haunting,Film-Noir look to it. Great direction by Lynch.<br/><br/>The score by Angelo Badalamenti is excellent and at times beautiful,suspenseful and mysterious. Masterful score from Badalamenti. There is also great songs from Bobby Vinton(Blue Velvet),Roy Orbison(In Dreams),Love Letters(Ketty Lester)and Mysteries Of Love(Julee Cruise). Amazing songs.<br/><br/>In final word,if you David Lynch,Film-Noir,Mysteries or films in general,I highly suggest you see Blue Velvet,a beautiful,haunting and disturbing Masterpiece that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10. This movie is disturbing as well as entertaining. A great cast is made to make this movie worthwhile. It's been set in a town I know well later on in time, but the story line is well presented. You have a town that picturesque, and very quaint looking. However, something lurks beneath surface as it follows. Here you have a clean cut man name Jeffrey Beaumont,(Kyle MacLachlan) who is staying at his aunt's house following his father's stroke. When he walks through a lot, he discovered a severed human ear. He takes the ear to a detective in which he knows his daughter(Laura Dern). This discovery leads to something deep and sinister in his hometown. There his neighbor, Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini), is a nightclub singer, and a pawn in a drug dealing lead by Frank Booth(Dennis Hopper). This man is so frightening, no one is brave enough to take him down. In the apartment scene, Jeffrey gets enticed by Dorothy, he ended up being her lover behind Sandy's back. She makes Jeffrey strip after he gets caught, and after the sadistic acts of Frank, she seduced Jeffrey again by feeling her. This is too much. He does his best trying to take down Frank. Even if It's painful enough by hurting Sally. Who would know the Man in Yellow was working with the police? Not the detective until too late. Strange and intriguing, this movie was deep as it is disturbing. Made for mature viewers only. 5 stars! I had the pleasure of viewing this 1986 classic on Blu Ray for the films 25th anniversary. The last time I saw it I was a college student and had just been released. It received a lot of critical word of mouth, with many critics hailing it as a daring one-of-a-kind film experience. Over the years, familiarity with David Lynch and it's challenging line of films and Blue Velvet's success and attention have not muted the film's undeniable power and sheer magic.<br/><br/>The film is set in the mid 1980s in a culturally distinctive America: a time of Regan administration, a time of big hair and bright color, a time of excess and indulgence. The location is equally distinguishable: a moderately small populated Midwestern American town where humble innocence is the norm. Apple pie's are rife and diner's are a frequent hangout for pretty much everyone around town. But the film itself is about this clash of innocence and good and virtue with irrevocable evil and irredeemable and dangerous. I won't go into the plot in explicit detail because I don't want to ruin the experience.<br/><br/>All I can say, though, is Blue Velvet is a cinematic masterpiece and its impact has reached far beyond its era. Lynch's ability to fuse all things disturbing with undeniable pristine prettiness and tameness is wonderful. For the film really does represent the world we live in at large: there is a great amount of ugliness, but there is also a great amount of wonder and beauty. <br/><br/>"It's a strange world" I loved the performances by Hopper, Rossellini, Dern, MacLachlan. Not everyone will like this movie, but it you like David Lynch films, you will love this one. The soundtrack is amazing, I don't know who thought about including the song In Dreams by Roy Orbison.. but it was just the perfect choice. I enjoyed every minute of the movie and I could watch over and over, and every time I watch it again, it's like catching a new detail. I don't want to say too much about the film because there are no words to describe what I felt when I watched it, it is an experience you have to see for yourself. I really admire Lynch's imagination, how could he think about writing such a weird and incredible story? I had funny thoughts when I first saw this. I didn't know what to think. It was part distorted fairy tale, part erotic drama, part thriller, part college boy's voyeuristic fantasies captured on a celluloid a la Peeping Tom (1960). It was about as shocking as any horror movie you can think of in the last 40 years - including Psycho. Frank Booth is legitimately creepy and Dorothy Vallens broken 'porcelain doll' performance is haunting and depressing. I didn't know if I really loved it or if it seemed wooden in parts and was ALMOST an excellent film but I was definitely taken back by it and I kept thinking about it. I couldn't articulate how I felt. <br/><br/>I decided to re-watch it recently and I fell in love. Its an excellent film and from my observations David Lynch has deliberately made Jeffrey Beaumont a wooden character in order to convey the happy-go-lucky way of life in small town America. It's original but in a 'familiar' kind of way. Maybe because we are all so used to this kind of American way of life? Only to be shocked and disturbed by the underlying rot that Jeffrey discovers. It's entertaining, thought-provoking and has inspired countless imitations, none of them ever equaling the shock factor that Blue Velvet produces. The colors and the cinematography is jaw dropping-ly beautiful, especially on the remastered DVD and the direction is fantastic - I truly believed Lynch peaked with this film. <br/><br/>Imagine how superb this will look on BLU-RAY? I cannot wait and will be quick to purchase it when it is released. "Blue Velvet" is a take on film noir with typical Lynch weirdness, unique atmosphere and breathtaking cinematic work. Although I did not appreciate it on my first viewing, I came to love it, and now it's one of my favorite films of all time. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) comes home from college to visit his sick and bed-ridden father who had a tragic accident. Having made a startling discovery (to be more exact, a human ear lying in the grass), out of sheer boredom and driven by passion for adventure Jeffrey decides to proceed with this mystery and gets involved with a beautiful, seductive night-club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) living in a shabby apartment building, which is somewhat incongruous to the sleepy, picturesque suburban paradise of Lumberton.<br/><br/>Dorothy, a queer mixture, of "damsel in distress" and "femme fatale", is in a middle of a life and death situation involving her husband and son. She is subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of violence by a psychopathic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and his demented associates. Jeffrey's further investigation reveals that one of the police detectives is also involved in the criminal activities of the gang, and that means that he will have to deal with these people using his own resources. He confides in Sandy, a good-natured and sweet blonde, whose father is a hard-working and honest policeman. Sandy is obviously fascinated by Jeffrey's recklessness, but her level-headed nature prevents her from becoming his full-time accomplice and ditching her boy-friend, at least, not until later on.<br/><br/>Stylistically, Blue Velvet is a precursor to Lynch's notorious collaboration with Mark Frost - the cult classic TV series "Twin Peaks". These creations share a lot of elements including the small seemingly sleepy town setting, a dangerously attractive brunette, oldies often played under disturbing circumstances, dreamy angel-like singers (remember Julie Cruise in Twin Peaks), flame and even the famous red curtains. Although "Blue Velvet" is an erotic thriller without any supernatural context, somehow you expect the Dwarf to pop up and start dancing at any time... although no dwarf appears, it manages to get just as weird as Twin Peaks.<br/><br/>The blue velvet is a leitmotif of the film. "Blue Velvet" is a song that Dorothy has to perform in a club every night looking straight in the eyes of her tormentors. Dorothy also wears a blue velvet gown at home, and Frank has a fetish for blue velvet using it in his perverted sexual games. Blue velvet is a symbol of mystery, obsession and hidden passions lurking beneath the exterior of men.<br/><br/>Lynch uses different colors for the scenes taking place in the normal world of American suburbia versus Dorothy's apartment or Ben's house. Lumbertown is depicted as idyllic joyful place with bright yellow tulips against the white fence and bright green grass. Everything involving Dorothy or the criminals is shot either in the darkness or unnaturally striking colors. The director makes an interesting application of the contrast between the two women in protagonist's life. Dangerous and seductive Dorothy is a voluptuous brunette wearing blue or red gowns, whereas Sandy is a slender blonde, your typical American next door cheerleader.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLahlan is adorable and gives an incredibly convincing performance. His love-making scenes with Rossellini are tasteful, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Rosselini was quite adequate, especially if we take into account the complexity of the character, but I couldn't get rid of this thought in the back of my head that Sherilyn Fenn would have been much more memorable. Perhaps, I am irreparably spoiled by Twin Peaks... However, Rossellini's was Lynch's favorite at the time, so we can understand being a little bit biased here. Dennis Hopper is way over the top as Frank Booth, yet still turns in an amazing performance, being psychotic, violent and pitiful at the same time. His every appearance on the screen is a an avalanche of emotions, swear-words and craziness. He is a dangerous man and Jeffrey who stepped in his way knows that the only way for him to stay alive is to eliminate Frank.<br/><br/>Lynch decided to end this flick on a joyful note. Everything goes back to normal in Lumberton, Jeffrey and Sandy will probably go on to have a long and wholesome life together with children on the way. Dorothy is hugging her son in the final moments of the movie, and the robin as the symbol of good is devouring the bug just as in Sandy's dream. However, despite the obviously happy ending and triumph of the good over the evil, the final scenes have such a dream-like and surreal quality that one cannot help suspecting that something bad is doomed to happen again.

With Lynch you never know for sure... A great cast wasted in this self indulgent, rambling, waste of time. Plenty of faux symbolism, significant of nothing. The 1986 feature by notoriously difficult to understand David Lynch, was an exercise for the auteur to dabble with the topics of voyeurism and kidnapping. Blue Velvet was the vehicle Lynch used to film one of his most vivid childhood memories of seeing a bloodied naked woman walking down the street close to his childhood home, and build a film around that vision. What was her story? Why was she in the street naked and wounded? Lynch never knew, but Blue Velvet delves deep into the most idyllic of places and proves just how seedy of an underworld can exist where you least expect it. David Lynch, who even today describes himself simply as an Eagle Scout from Missoula Montana, has always been fascinated by what lurks below the surface. Growing up in one house resting behind a white picket fence after another, David was always in-tuned to the evil that may lurk beneath small town life. As Lynch has said: "I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are always red ants underneath." <br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is a college student who has returned home after the news that his father had been hospitalized. Tasked with running the hardware store his father owns while he is in the hospital, Jeffrey quickly settles back into the small town in which he was born, Lumberton, a town reliant upon lumber where it seems every house has white picket fences and tulips growing in the yard. Despite the picturesque atmosphere of Lumberton, Jeffrey discovers a human ear in a field on his way home from visiting his father in the hospital. Understandably troubled by his discovery, Jeffrey takes the ear in a bag to a detective he knows in town. After initially keeping him in the fold as the investigation gets underway, Jeffrey is soon told to forget about it and told that no further information will be divulged to him. Unable to forget, Jeffrey seeks out ways to stay involved in the case, one of those ways is by spending time with the detective's daughter, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern). Through their interactions together, Sandy shares what she knows about the case with Jeffrey, as her bedroom lies just above her father's home office. Sandy is able to enlighten Jeffrey that the case has to do with Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) who lives in an apartment near Jeffrey. Jeffrey's unquenchable curiosity leads him to break into Dorothy's apartment, with Sandy's help, and discover the sordid secrets his charming town actually holds.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced that there is a film in cinema history with a better opening than Blue Velvet. The fire truck driving by, the man waving while watering his lawn, the red roses lining the white picket fences which descend underground to the world hidden by grass inhabited by insects immediately gets to the heart of David Lynch's evaluation of small towns. Showing such gleaming iconography of small town life and the contrast of what goes on beneath the surface, a dark violent reality covered from view is exactly the kind of microscope Lynch reveals to his audiences. In the most basic sense, Lynch warns his audience that things are not always what they seem, and there can be a whole other world hidden beneath the surface of even the most seemingly innocent place. The interplay between the most trustworthy of people and the secrets they lurk with in the shadows is a constant presence in Lynch's work. Perhaps my favorite part of Blue Velvet is the fact that it sounds exactly like a David Lynch production. I'm not actually, for once, referring to Lynch's perfect sound design with ample harrowing hollow sounds filling the ears of the audience; that flawless use of sound is present in Blue Velvet, but what is so prominent to me is how much the script sounds like it came only from the pen of David Lynch. I'm no casual fan of Lynch's work, mind you; I list Eraserhead, the auteur's debut feature not only my favorite Lynch film, but my favorite film of all-time. I'm one of "those Lynch fans" that will discuss the merit of Dune and actually enjoyed every d*mn fine episode of season 2 of Twin Peaks. I worship at the alter of David Lynch and would sit through, happily, anything he decides to give us. That fandom has led me to ingest hours of Lynch interviews and I was immediately stricken by the dialogue and how much it sounded exactly like words that would come directly out of Lynch's mouth. Laura Dern's entrance from behind the trees ranks among the best film entrances, in my book. Now is probably the best time to say that Laura Dern is painfully underrated and a phenomenal actress. The Lynch color palette complete with striking vibrant primary colors adds to the magic of a film with the name of a color in the title. Lynch is probably (look at me pretending to be objective) one of the greats at using high contrast shots to pack an extra punch in his shots and such contrast, in combination with the lighting and sound design create a complete Lynch experience even in one of his more linear productions. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the more linear the narrative, the comparatively less I like the entries in David Lynch's filmography, the auteur is my favorite director of all time and I am so thankful for his films and constant desire to detect what remains hidden in the world. Blue Velvet (1986)<br/><br/>Coy, Arrogant, Abusive Fun? Not for Everyone.<br/><br/>Sadistic or kinky, warped or really creative, boring as hell or mesmerizing. Who knows? It must be all the above. I mean, it really is at times all those things, including mesmerizing (briefly) and boring (often). You have to love not just over-the-top styles in movies, but this particular style, because it demands a lot if you don't. To survive the movie happy, you have to not care too much, and brush off the ugliness, and laugh off the sexist lacerations.<br/><br/>Even many people who love the movie agree the story, the "plot" in some functional sense, is a weakness, but I think the argument goes that the plot doesn't need to be strong. It's about this hyped up sequence of incidents that fit together more intuitively, and build up our sense of who is who and what might happen until the shootout and the patched-on ending. Yes, there is the crazed and crazy style and mood of the thing to keep us going. And sporadic lurches of either violence or sex or usually both. That this is new territory (a laurel often applied) is debatable, except we have the truism, if it's new to some viewer, it's new to that viewer. And there are a lot of Blue Velvet fans.<br/><br/>I'm not one of them. Not that I hated it, not completely. I can see the appeal of these exaggerated characters, but they strike me as false, not in the theatrical sense that I accept as style, but in some awkward sense that they are just pasted into the sets. Dennis Hopper is intense, and he snarls and can swear up a storm, and I know, or assume, he's meant to be a comic book kind of "fake" bad guy, a man with his badness painted on brightly. <br/><br/>All the directorial prettiness and glib overlays of innocence and worldly excess, all that anti-nice irony, all that plastic, color-coordinated clash of sweetness (portrayed mid- American naiveté) and psychotic meanness (portrayed in nasty clichés), make for an inventive shell. It just has too many dragged out moments, sections of driving or dancing or waiting where it slows. There is little actual suspense--maybe when he's hiding in the closet, or when the bad guys take him for a car ride. But then it loses are and gets campy and silly. <br/><br/>I don't really care that the material is depraved. Life is depraved. There are lots of great movies with lots of awful things happening in them. But Blue Velvet strikes me as coy, the way it goes partying in sex and violence, and the coyness, more than the partying, is rough going. The violence against the woman played by Isabella Rossellini isn't good movie fun, and it isn't dramatic movie tragedy. It's presented too realistically to be ignore, but it isn't real, quite--the movie isn't real--and yet if you defend it as camp, it's abusive and cruel. Okay, I know, it's the way it is sometimes. But I don't really want to see the worst of life presented as haute couture, a highbrow/lowbrow adventure that avoids all judgment in the name of good fun. After the disaster of "Dune "(1984), David Lynch wished to make a film noir in the tradition of the ones made in the fifties. It is in these conditions that "Blue Velvet" was shot and it is very overrated by a part of the American critics and even by IMDb (7.7 out of 10!). It also enjoys a nefarious reputation.<br/><br/>However, if you take a closer look at it, you realize that there is nothing to make a fuss about. All right, the film can be taken for a descent into hell as Lynch loves them but it is just a classic detective plot that is used as a vital lead to an underground world of corruption and sexual perversion. This world contrasts with the apparent peacefulness of the small town where the action takes place. In a way, the beginning of the movie includes a significant sequence that speaks volume about the contents of the film: Lynch's camera goes from a green and shiny garden to arrive underground to a swarming of insects. In a way, Lynch's work illustrates well the famous maxim: don't be taken in by appearances and in short, the director tries to tell us that good and evil aren't so far from each other (even the hero Jeffrey Beaumont seems to be fascinated by evil in his sexual rapports with Dorothy Vallens). But this revelation doesn't really constitute a novelty because Alfred "hitch" Hitchcock had thought of it before in a better way with "Shadow of a doubt" (1943). The main character (Theresa Wright) perceived her uncle acted by Joseph Cotten as a respectable and likable man but she discovered that he was actually a dangerous criminal. As for the sexual perversion, I think it is better expressed in the music with the Velvet Underground (see "Venus in furs" for instance).<br/><br/>In spite of interesting shots (the sequence with the insects previously quoted) and gruesome details (of course, the cut ear), Lynch's making remains rather flat and his film sometimes verges on the grotesque like the moment when Dennis Hopper kisses the hero on the mouth with lipstick. It also introduces quite freely sadomasochistic scenes and in most of the director's movies, this last one didn't forget the gaudy effects (the killed detective who still stands). Anyway, Lynch's fans will be elated with this second class thriller but for me, Lynch's best movies remain the two first ones: "Eraserhead" (1977) and "Elephant Man" (1980). What he shot next hasn't got very much importance... To put it frankly this movie was amazing, there are so many layers to this movie that one could talk about each adding up to make the masterpiece that is: Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>We start off with the idealistic setting- the American dream and this is drastically contrasted by the accident involving Jeffrey's father. This being one of the several amazing contrasts throughout the film. The first scene is a great example of that, another would be the striking differences in the town, one side being this happy- almost perfect- setting, contrasted by the other side, which is dark and filled with crime. Both of these sides are separated by only Lincoln street, which, as the two parallels start to merge, is a great example of how things aren't always as they first appear.
Another brilliant 'nothing Is as it seems' moment is through the character of Jeffrey. Jeffrey is painted as an innocent bystander who gradually finds himself involved with a possible murder and a group of drug dealing kidnappers. However, this is a misdirect. In Blue velvet the symbolic imagery creates enormous depth to the film. The colour blue is used to represent secrets and the revealing of them, shown by the opening of the blue velvet curtains- the very first thing we see when the film starts. So, with the character of Jeffrey he is often seen to be in blue lighting or wearing the colour blue, and sometimes to just be surrounded by it. Going back to the original point, we see Jeffrey as this innocent character but as the film carries on it can be seen that he's not. The turning point for his character is when he hits Dorothy even though he had previously stated that he didn't want to, however with him giving into his desires it shows the true nature of his character, and whilst this happens the bed sheets are seen to be blue. Another symbol that reiterates this is the closet. The closet represents someone (in this case Jeffrey) looking in on the world. When Jeffrey sees Dorothy being hit he immediately assumes that she is being abused, though, when he exits the closet (him joining the world rather than looking in and assuming) he discovers she's the one the consents to and requests it to be done. This similar imagery is shown through the character of Sandy assuming the Jeffrey is a good guy based on the one view of him that she can see. When Jeffrey leaves the closet Dorothy makes him remove his clothing, which is symbolic to the idea of him removing his false exterior self and revealing his true character with her as he has been given the environment to do so.
Symbols show up through out the movie, electricity representing murder and dogs representing turning points for characters, it's another ode to Lynch's brilliance when it comes to nothing being surface level.
One thing that must be commented on is the use of colouring between the different sides of town and the people who represent them (as well as the visual depicting of them) , a good example being Sandy and her opposite- Dorothy. Sandy is blonde and wears pinks and whites, which gives a sense of innocence and youthfulness to her character. Whereas Dorothy wears blues and blacks, with dark hair and heavy make up, the blues showing she helps to reveal secrets but the rest contrasting Sandy, showing her difficult position in life.
One thing that must be said as a final nod to this incredible movie is the shot of Dorothy's apartment and the bathroom, how characters get further away while the camera stays in place, the further away they get shows how their emotions become more distraught which is a very subtle detail but is so wonderful to pick up on.
Lynch managed to create a movie that anyone could walk away from thinking about how silly it was that Jeffrey got himself involved in such a thing, but the more you look the more you realise nothing is as it seems. There is a whole lot to unpack here. David Lynch is probably the king of unique imagery and symbolism. He fills Blue Velvet with countless surreal visuals and moments which leave you aghast. Dennis Hopper is menacingly brilliant and a very memorable villain. This is a film which requires a lot of contemplation and that's why this film has endured for so long. When college student Jeffrey Beaumont's father is hospitalised he returns home to what at first appears to be the Perfect American Town... he soon discovers that it is anything but. On a piece of wasteland he finds a severed human ear which he takes to Detective John Williams, a friend of his fathers. Williams' daughter Sandy approaches Jeffrey and tells him she overheard her father talking about a possible connection to singer Dorothy Vallens; Jeffrey decides to investigate. This leads to him getting caught in a very dangerous place with some incredibly disturbing characters; most notably Frank Booth.<br/><br/>This is very much a David Lynch film; the situation has a not-quite-real feel without being quite as weird as 'Twin Peaks'... it is far more disturbing though. Kyle MacLachlan is impressive as the ordinary Jeffrey caught in an extraordinary situation but it is Dennis Hopper who steals every scene he is in as the Frank... one of cinema's more disturbing creations. The way the story unfolds creates a real sense of danger and its ending is far from clear till almost the end. The rest of the cast are solid; most notably Isabella Rossellini as femme fatale Dorothy and Laura Dern as the innocent Sandy. Due to the disturbing nature of many scenes, which include sexual violence, this certainly won't be for everybody but if you like disturbing neo-noir then this is definitely a must see. "It's a strange world, isn't it?" Blending psychological horror and film noir, the title of this mystery film is taken from Bobby Vinton's 1963 song of the same name. The film stands as an example of director David Lynch in casting against the norm, noted for re- launching the career of Dennis Hopper and providing Isabella Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond the work of a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman, something for which she had until then been known. After the commercial and critical failure of Dune (1984), Lynch made attempts at developing a more "personal story", something of which was somewhat characteristic of the surrealist style he displayed in his debut Eraserhead (1977). The script of Blue Velvet had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and 80s, as many major studios declined it due to its strong sexual and violent content. It wasn't until Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis, owner of the independent studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group at the time, agreed to finance and produce the film. Does this film succeed in asking the question if close-knit communities have always possessed a well-polished façade and that therein lies some dreadful force lurking beneath? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>Upon returning home to the sleepy American every town of Lumberton, North Carolina after his father has a near-fatal stroke, college student Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) discovers a severed human ear in an abandoned field. Teaming up with Detective Williams' pretty blonde daughter Sandy (Laura Dern) to solve the mystery, they believe the beautiful, sultry local night lounge singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) may be connected with the morbid case. Beaumont ventures furthur on in his amateur sluething, eventually becoming drawn into her dark world and the twisted underbelly of suburbia. Here he encounters Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), a sexually depraved, obscenity-spewing noxious fume-inhaling (possibly amyl nitrate) psychopath of whom performs bizarre sexual proclivities in molesting Vallens in her apartment as his cronies hold her kidnapped husband and child hostage offscreen. Jeffrey hides in her closet when Frank enters the room, silently watching the both of them and the horrible actions of sadomasochism that unfold before his eyes between the open slats of the doors. Booth continually refers to Dorothy as "Mommy" and to himself as "Daddy" or "Baby", who "wants to f***". One of the more memorable scenes of the film occurs after Frank catches Jeffrey and Dorothy together, forcing them to accompany him to the apartment to where Dorothy's son is being held by his suave, effeminate partner in crime Ben (Dean Stockwell). He lip-syncs Roy Orbison's "In Dreams", sending Frank into maudlin sadness, and then rage. Eventually the deranged Frank gets his due when Jeff fatally shoots him in the head from inside Dorothy's closet when the madman searches to shoot him in the wrong room. Detective Williams takes over, gun drawn, entering with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey reunites with her as they now go ahead with their relationship and lives. They note the unusual appearance of robins in their town, referring to the dream Sandy had told Jeffrey about earlier, with the birds being a sign of hope for humanity.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet has achieved cult status since its initial theatrical release and has generated significant academic attention in regard to its thematic symbolism. It is widely regarded as one of Lynch's best works. Despite the film's initial appearance as a mystery, it also operates on a number of thematic levels as well. Blue Velvet owes a large debt to 1950s film noir, containing/exploring such conventions as the femme fatale (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable villain (Frank Booth) the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont) and the film's use of shadowy, sometimes dark cinematography. It also establishes Lynch's famous "askew vision", introducing several common elements of which would later become his trademarks: distorted characters, a polarized world and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. The most significant "Lynchian" trademark in the movie is the depiction on unearthing a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town. Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is "seeing something that was always hidden". This alludes to the film's plot central idea: even beyond the white-washed picket fences, neat little houses in rows upon rows, a blue sky and the greenest grass on a lawn, the film excels in peeking behind the velvety blue curtain dividing the realms of tranquility and ugliness to, after three decades, shock, thrill, terrify and mesmerize with its relentless power and unprepared, exhilarating depth. Nothing on the surface is really ever what it appears to be beneath, as the film's title portrays this perfectly. And, though you may never hear Orbison's classic oldie the same way ever again, this unnerving film reveals, perhaps, that suburbia does sound like a nice place to stay close to after all. Stretched, boring, without charm at all... and on top of that we get to listen irritating Kyle MacLachlan for two hours repeating "You're beautiful" to unappealing, somewhat horsy Laura Dern. Crappy movie.<br/><br/>"Isabella Rossellini is degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film" - Roger Ebert<br/><br/>I absolutely agree with this statement and, as this is crappy movie, Issabela should have refused that humiliation and to sue them for even offering her to embarrass herself in this crap.<br/><br/>Or, at least, that's my opinion. :D If you exclude Eraserhead, one film which I haven't fully seen (I didn't like it) BV sets the trend of uniquely and tastefully weird style of film and story telling, by this classic director, where you, the audience are left to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Blue Velvet is a good if perfect start too, to this trend of stylish weirdorama, Lost Highway, being his most complex. This movie, a short lived cinema one, that came out in 87, is set decades before, it's opening in some beautiful and gorgeous shots, yet something frightening about some of them, as if forewarning us to what terrifying tale ensues. The first weird shot, has an old guy, who's just passively watering the plants, where the next moment, he keels over as having a heart attack. What's weird is how he falls and lands, uncharacteristically, the hose still in his hand, shooting out water in a weird direction. This whole shot looks out of whack, but has unsettling, and curious, "can't take your eyes away" appeal. But this is only the start. The man's son, Jeffrey (Kyle Maclachlan) a clean cut college kid (one of the nicest you'll ever meet) who quits his studies and comes home to visit his hospital ridden father. Cutting back through a paddock, from the hospital, he comes across you wouldn't expect to find: A severed ear. And for him, this is the start of a mystery, he wants to obsessively unravel. He's like a kid with candy. He warms up the cockles with the neighborhood sweetheart, a blonde innocent, Sandy (Laura Dern) the daughter of a detective working the case. She joins the curiously crazed and risk taking Jeremy, in this dangerous adventure, which leads them to a female nightclub singer Dorothy (the fantastic Rosellini) where we then venture into much weirder territory, as we finally Rosellini's crazed boyfriend, Frank, who frequently uses an oxygen mask to break, angrily spouting out of character dialogue, especially when directed at Rosellini in a spate of a popular expletive. He's playing another morbid bad guy, and he does it convincingly and frighteningly well. He too, holds the key to Dorothy's kidnapped husband and kid, where I really don't want to spoil anymore of it for you. But we have some really out there, out of place scenes and characters. One is that of a dangerous weirdo friend of Hoppers, Ben (Stockwell) most memorable, for sucker punching Maclachlan in the chest. Stockwell creates the most weirdest, darkest and memorable scene of this out there film, mouthing as if singing, using the real mic deal, to Orbison's "Candy Colored Clown". What's especially weird about this, is Stockwell's score of friends who are mostly middle aged and plump. They don't fit, ridiculously so, but how many Lynch scenes are like this, in the wake of this, and in this cult film. There are some other weird moments, including a standing dead guy, where his arm manages to still move and swipe something. Also a blind black guy, who must have X ray vision, who works in Jeremy's shop. This is a great thriller, because it will, despite not wanting to, as having to just enjoy the film, make you use noggen, to see where the film is leading or where pieces of the puzzle fit. Even in the after, you could still find yourself, trying to analyze, fully add it up, wracking your brain. BV is not for everyone, It's the first of a series of out there films of Lynch's, where underneath it, lies a much more real world reality. Only Lynch knows how to make it interesting and f..k with your mind, instead of spelling it out to you. A smart unique style, and format, you have to go with, or get the boat. BV, is a perfect and fine vehicle to start this odd spate of flicks off, where Hopper and Rosellini's performance owe thanks, as well as seeing the great actress naked. Indulge. David Lynch shocked audiences worldwide with his 1986 bizarre, twisted and sexually charged thriller "Blue Velvet". The question at the time was did it live up to its hype? It certainly is, and it is definitely more than a surreal sexual thriller. Blue Velvet, a thematically rich film, operates on many levels, and is a rather clever throw-back to the noir films of the 40s and 50s, only with hints of surrealism and far more violence and sexuality. The plot is a simple detective sleuth story, although the actual film is anything BUT that. It is about the repressed, unknown human sexual desires that hide themselves within us and are unleashed only when we come close to true evil. In this case, it is Frank Booth who unleashes the worst in Jeffrey. While at the same time Jeffrey is the films hero, he also dances pretty close to the fire in terms of turning into Frank with his sadistic, sick fantasies. Then there is Dorothy, who's masochistic side has been unraveled by Frank. Dorothy is a woman who has probably put up with traumatic sexual abuse for so long she has come to enjoy it. Then there is the young Sandy, whom while at the time is horrified and repulsed by the danger Jeffrey witnesses, gets enjoyment (for lack of a better word) out of their detective episodes.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a very deep film. Like I said before, it operates on many levels and although people mistake it for being pure trash, it is actually a brilliant, well-constructed and beautifully filmed drama about the loss of innocence and the darkness that lurks between a seemingly picturesque surface. David Lynch's masterpiece and a definite must see. .... Because he`s easy to analyze . Look at the opening sequence to BLUE VELVET - A montage of shots of suburban America followed by a slow pan into the grass where insects crawl from the ground . Don`t you get it ? Like the ground there`s something ugly trying to break through the calm reassuring surface of suburban America . Gosh what a genius Lynch must be allowing the audience into the concept of subtext like that . But can anyone tell me why he continually casts Kyle McClachlan in his movies ? He`s got a pretty face but not much screen presence .<br/><br/>But BLUE VELVET isn`t a bad film  ( Though it`s not as good as its high IMDB rating says it is ) , Lynch doesn`t go overboard with his often pretentious style of directing and it`s a film that would deserve the oft used tag of " Hitchcock style thriller " for the most part , though Dennis Hopper`s show stopping performance as the villain is something better suited to a Scorsese picture . But it`s Hopper who made BLUE VELVET so memorable for me This film is one that I actually never heard of, but was listed in the Fangoria Top 300 Horror Films issue, so I sought it out. This was my second foray into David Lynch films as I had seen Eraserhead in college. The first time I saw this, I didn't know what to think. My last viewing was the 4K transfer in the theater actually. The synopsis here is the discovery of a severed human ear found in a field leads a young man on an investigation related to a beautiful, mysterious nightclub singer and group of psychopathic criminals who have kidnapped her child.<br/><br/>It then begins Mr. Beaumont (Jack Harvey) watering his lawn. He has something wrong with him as he collapses to the ground. We then see a bunch of beetles crawling all over themselves. We then see a young man walking down a country road, this is Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan). He goes into the hospital and into the room of the man who collapsed. It turns out that Jeffrey is his. He is home to help out at his father's hardware store with him in the hospital.<br/><br/>On his walk home, he stops off near a shed on that same road. He tries to break a bottle with rocks. While he is looking for stones, he finds a human ear. He collects it with a paper bag. Jeffrey then goes to the local police station and looks for a Detective Williams (George Dickerson). He finds him on the second floor. We learn the reason Jeffrey goes to him is that he's friends with his father. He turns the ear over to him and Detective Williams launches an investigation<br/><br/>Jeffrey goes home where he talks with his mother (Priscilla Pointer), and his aunt (Frances Bay). He tells them he is going for a walk and ends up at Detective Williams' house. He tries to follow up on the investigation, but doesn't get much. As Jeffrey is leaving, he meets the detective's daughter Sandy (Laura Dern). They go for a walk and we see there's chemistry there. Dern reveals to him that her room is above her father's office and she gives him some information about the case that Jeffrey has started.<br/><br/>The next day he picks her up from school, where she is a senior. They go to a diner and he reveals that he has a plan to get more information about the case. Sandy reluctantly agrees to help him. They go to the seedy apartment building and Jeffrey goes up, pretending to be pest control. The apartment belongs to Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini). Sandy is supposed to knock at the door to distract her so he can find a way back into the apartment later. Instead a man in a bright suit comes in. He makes eye contact with Jeffrey, but Dorothy takes him into the hall. While this happens, Jeffrey does finds a set of keys and pockets them before leaving.<br/><br/>Jeffrey reluctant continues on with his plan, needing Sandy to come with him to the club where Dorothy sings. While she is there, he goes back to her apartment to find a hiding spot. The problem is that after she comes home, he makes a sound and she finds him. It takes an even darker turn when Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) shows up. Jeffrey gets himself entangled in this web of kidnapping and violence.<br/><br/>I have to say that after seeing this film a few times, I have a much better appreciation for it after each viewing. As I've said, I've seen a few of his films now and he really is an interesting filmmaker. He is great at taking a film like this, which has a dark, noir type feel and giving a dream/nightmare feel to it.<br/><br/>Even though this has that type of feel of a dream, this one is the most grounded in reality from him that I've seen so far. As I said, this definitely is a neo-noir film first and foremost. We have Jeffrey who is a college student, but he's hooked into investigating where this ear came from. Dorothy is most definitely a femme fatale and Frank is a terrifying villain for sure. It goes much deeper than that though.<br/><br/>Something that I really picked up after this last viewing is a corruption of innocence. Jeffrey is sucked in by the mystery of finding the ear. Sandy sparks this when she reveals information she shouldn't have to him, giving him a route to continue on. We see during that first encounter in her apartment that Dorothy is into some violent sexual acts. I'm not one to judge, but she does like to be slapped around. I wonder though, was she into this before her child was taken and the corruption is from needing to feel alive? She does start to corrupt Jeffrey as he keeps coming over. I do really think that this film is kind of saying how this is an issue, as he in turn corrupts Sandy from the perfect, high school life she has going for her. There's also an interesting duality that in the beginning of the film, we're hearing the classic rendition of 'Blue Velvet' and seeing the idyllic suburban life while later hearing Dorothy's version before meeting the seedy criminals she's entangled with.<br/><br/>That takes me to the pacing of this film, which I know the first time I saw this I thought it drug on. After my last two viewings, it doesn't feel that way and I just get sucked into what the film is showing us. It also made me so anxious with some scenes while also giving a sense of dread. There's some interesting editing while flashes of images to metaphorically explain things, which I dug. It runs at an even 2 hours and I have to say I don't mind it a lot. I do think there are some things that could be removed to tighten it up, but being that it is Lynch, I'm not surprised that it's there. There's an interesting idea that once you get into this lifestyle, it is hard to get out of. I think the ending is fitting and a nice revenge for what we get earlier in this one for sure.<br/><br/>From here I want to shift to the acting, which is great across the board. I think Rossellini is really good as this broken woman. She wants someone stable like Jeffrey, but she can't get away from the manic that has taken over her life. She is in turn corrupting him though. This takes me next to MacLachlan who I also think this great. He's someone who truly hasn't experienced the world and almost treats this as a game. He gets spooked when he sees how real all of this. It also jades him as well. Hopper is a manic here and I absolutely love his performance. It truly is terrifying. Dern is solid as a high school student who is even greener in life than Jeffrey. She tries to resist, but that temptation is too great and it messes with her idea of what her life should be. Dean Stockwell is also really good and I like the cameos by Hope Lange, Dickerson, Pointer, Bay, Brad Dourif and Jack Nance to just name a few. They help to round this out for what was needed.<br/><br/>Next I will shift to the effects of this film. There aren't really a lot as it isn't that type of film. The bit of blood we get looks good. I did notice a couple of times that marks on Jeffrey's face change from scene to scene when it is supposed to be the same day. I could be wrong on this though so I won't take anything away. A podcaster did point out that the mask Frank uses isn't connected to anything and it was after this viewing that I caught it. This is another thing I mark up as Lynch and his dreamlike aspects. I will say this film is shot beautifully for how ugly a lot of what we see is.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. This film uses a couple of renditions of the song 'Blue Velvet'. I personally like the different feel of each one that fits what the film is conveying. There's another song that Frank listens to a couple of times that syncing it up with the images doesn't necessarily match, but it does in a creepy way for sure.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I definitely feel like Lynch is a director for me that the more I watch his films, the more that I appreciate them. I definitely feel of the ones I've seen, this is the most grounded in reality while still having that dream or nightmare logic at times. I really like the neo-noir feel of this and how terrifying Frank is as a character. The film runs two hours, but I didn't notice it this time around. The acting was great across the board. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but it doesn't need them. It is shot beautifully and the soundtrack oddly fits for what they needed. I think this is a really good film. If this review sounds good and you can handle realistic violence, I would give this a viewing. It is not overly brutal, but there's a sick feel to it still. This movie understands the way mental health affects sexuality and vice versa very well. This is showcased with both the victim and the perpetrator, making for a very interesting character study. "It's a strange world, Sandy."<br/><br/>David Lynch constructs a beautiful, colorful, and dreamy universe in Blue Velvet. Jeffrey Beaumont finds a severed ear in the middle of a field, which launches his personal investigation into the story behind it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the most striking things about Blue Velvet are the music and the colors. A sweeping score plays in the background during the entire film, and Lynch uses oldies to shape many of the scenes (obviously the film bears the name of a Bobby Vinton hit). The oldies give the film a more hypnotic and disturbing vibe, bordering on creepy and eerie.<br/><br/>There are also many different shades and hues of colors used. Jeffrey, the protagonist, drives a bright red car. His (girl)friend has blonde hair and wears a bright pink dress. Contrast those colors with the antagonists: Frank's black leather jacket, Dorothy's dark blue eyeshadow, her deep-red apartment. But yet also consider the Yellow Man.<br/><br/>And then there's blue velvet. A material that is very dark and very deep. But it can shine when the light hits it in just the right way. Dorothy is< blue velvet.<br/><br/>Lynch designs Blue Velvet to be provocative. We repeatedly witness Frank take out his breath mask before he does unspeakable things to people, including a sexual assault. We all know Frank is the villain, and the audience is on Jeffery's side. We want to know everything he knows. But could Jeffrey a villain too? Or is he just a flawed hero? When Sandy asks him if he's a "detective or a pervert", is she asking us the same thing?<br/><br/>The movie is brilliantly acted by everyone involved, and Dennis Hopper deserves more credit. I would recommend this to anyone who admires filmmaking and the noir genre. Everything is just so carefully and perfectly executed it's hard not to admire this film. Hard to find in the constellation of David Lynch films a work so crudely and at the same time with some coherence unusual to the director's work.<br/><br/>Beginning as a satire to the American Way of Life, the film features a town called Lumberton with lawns, flowers, and gentle firefighters. After a domestic accident, the camera descends to ground level, where it reveals a community of insects, such as to say that under a beautiful landscape, underlies much corruption and dirt.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet then changes the direction of the plot for mystery movie: Jeffrey, a college student son of the man injured in the initial scene, returns from a visit to the hospital when he finds, in a vacant lot, a human ear, which carries in a little bag to the police officer Williams, his neighbor. But instead of leaving the investigation to the professionals, the boy decides to follow the case on his own, and worse, with the help of the daughter of the policeman, the beautiful and dreamy Sandy.<br/><br/>It is not long before the couple discovers a relationship between the event and nightclub singer Dorothy Valens. Going to the woman's apartment, Jeffrey not only learns that her husband (the owner of the ear) and his young son were kidnapped, as a witness that the abductor, the gangster Frank, turned the singer into his sex slave.<br/><br/>With Frank's departure, Jeffrey is discovered by Dorothy. From this, an unlikely relationship begins. Feeling safe with the young man, the singer embraces him and asks him to ... spank her. This ambiguity could become the new thread of the movie's driver: to what extent can the abusive relationship of the psychopath Frank be pleasurable to Dorothy, and how much will Jeffrey dive into the sought-after role of the perpetrator?<br/><br/>Still missing in these issues, we are surprised, along with Jeffrey, by the crazed Frank (perhaps one of the best performances of Dennis Hopper) that comes on the scene and retakes the previous theme.<br/><br/>If there is an (improbable) attempt at a happy ending, as in Sandy's dream with little robins, we realize that it is indeed a dream. Or a nightmare. A full 15 years before the dreamlike masterpiece that is Mulholland Drive, Lynch gave us <a href="/title/tt0090756/">Blue Velvet (1986)</a> - a film experience that like almost all Lynch films, brings up more questions than it answers. There's an eerie sense of energy they permeates through all its characters and the peculiar world in which its characters inhabit. Don't try to understand... don't try to piece it together. It is definitely not what Lynch intended. Simply take in the cinematic bizarreness and watch as a master storyteller pulls you in. When it comes to using film as vehicle for evoking "feeling" rather than "logic", you'd be hard-pressed to find a guy better at it than him. After watching Mulholland Dr. I thought this movie will be equally weird but actually it was pretty normal although I liked Mulholland Dr. more. Lynch has beautiful style of directing and you can see it in every movie he directed. Isabella Rossellini is magnificent and her voice is from heaven. Great ending but I thought some scenes were too long. This is one of my all time favorite films.  Opinions I have heard are never in the middle with this one.  They seem to run the extremes between "masterpiece" and "trash".<br/><br/>The film has its shocking, in-your-face moments, for sure, and perhaps this is just too much for some to swallow.  On the other hand, this is, indeed a serious filmwork which explores the price we can pay for letting our curiosity lead us too far astray----for exploring regions beyond life's "no trespassing" signs.  And, Blue Velvet shows just how easy it is to transgress from the safety and security of everyday life, and to slip effortlessly into a netherworld waiting just below our feet.  Lead us not into temptation?  Perhaps.   It's an ugly film, for sure, at times, but ultimately, redemptive, in my view. If you are looking for psychological mystery, believe me they is no mystery and nothing psychological but some creepy sadistic men.
Just avoid it if you are not in to pretentious movies. I did not find this odd or a classic of any sort. Reminds me of a movie with Robert Downey and Kilmer can't remember the name? It was ok. I found it more humorous than anything. The guy who lip synchs and Issabella were probably the most odd. Kyle was good for what he had to go with. I could hear his accent coming out. I was laughing most the film. I never felt suspense in any way except from Laura Derns father. I thought he was going to be some how involved. Imo the best part was when Issabella is standing naked at his house and keeps saying" he put his disease in me" . Haha. But I'm not seeing this as a classic. I had to edit to add. What the heck was Frank inhaling? Laughing gas? I cracked up everytime he did that. Now I really am thinking how ridiculous that this has such a huge cult following and 9/10 rating. Someone said if you like disgusting perverse things you'll like it and I do but this was neither really. Just campy and unbelievable. Ooof, such vast potential. Such an excellent cast, and yet, so very disappointing. <br/><br/>Before you bite my head off, let me just say this: Blue Velvet has a very enticing premise, and some truly great performances that are well worth the hype that they have received, it's just that the script wasn't worthy of the performances given. Do you understand? <br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini is striking as the club singer/mother who is brutalized (And enjoys it) by a sadistic psychopath. She shows us that beneath every wholesome person lies the very real (And sometimes masochistic) desires for sexual pleasure, and I love her for it. Her performance is stirring. It's raw and honest; even if that honesty is something she (And we) would never admit to.<br/><br/>But that is where the movie's originality and allure ends. Laura Dern is completely useless as the High School Sweet Heart and Kyle Maclachlan, though not totally inept as a junior investigator, doesn't go the distance in making us believe that this is a mystery film and not just a romp through some weird suburban neighborhood where housewives are kinky and police officers are corrupt. <br/><br/>The prestige bestowed on this movie is not really deserved. The director, the script and even some of the actors are afraid to take the tale where it is longing to go, and it's a shame, because the sexual intrigue and deadly game of cat and mouse that they tease you with is really the movie you are interested in seeing. 6.4/10 This is the first of David Lynches now-familiar thriller/romance/noir pictures that were nominally listed in the Festival or Art House section of video and DVD stores back in the day, although his style could actually be better described as terrifying crime drama, underlying quaint suburban Americana.<br/><br/>Blue Velvets protagonist, Jeffrey Beaumont, has left school a while ago and works for his dads shop in some bucolic, dull town called Lumberton. Upon finding a severed ear in a field one day he embarks on a naive, possibly very dangerous plan to solve a local crime, partly to impress the local police detectives pretty daughter, and partly out of a perverse interest in a sultry nightclub singer. After stealing a key to her apartment and hiding there he has the bumbling mischance to get drawn inter her fractured, disturbing life.<br/><br/>The club singer is Dorothy Vallens, and this is where the story gets odd; Vallens clearly has masochistic sexual tendencies, and has run in with a sadistic, nearly insane drug abuser called Frank who enjoys simulated acts of verbal abuse and sexual violence, usually under the influence of illegal drugs or other substances.<br/><br/>Creepily enough, people in the area are being killed in association with drug trafficking and Jeffrey is eventually taken out to be terrorized and beaten by Frank and his cronies; a group of maladjusted freaks with theatrical tendencies, all of them ex-con types, sadists, or criminals. <br/><br/>The psycho-sexual dynamic between Jeffrey as a love interest to Dorothy and Frank as a destructive id who imposes nothing but fear and verbal abuse on others is of great interest in this psychological (but not boring) crime drama - as is the films exploration of sexual violence, revenge, and criminal evil in seemingly pleasant small towns and cities.<br/><br/>Dorothy Vallens is played by Isabella Rossellini; model, philanthropist and daughter of Ingrid Bergman. In Blue Velvet, Frank and the local (eccentric) scumbags have abducted her husband and son, essentially to terrify her but its also suggested to extract cash from her via prostitution, although that part of her life is never fully explained.<br/><br/>A key scene features Hopper insanely ranting at Beaumont with staging that clearly suggests America's role as aggressor and propagandist, making oblique references to Vietnam syndrome, arms and military buildup and the cheap, disposable culture that the nation foists upon the world in general - the subversive nature of the scene makes the film something of a paradox, an all-American film complete with charming fifties music and pretty schoolgirls that has a very dark underbelly.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I liked the movie enough to watch it a number of times over the years, but also the costumes and character stylings are very much in tune with the mid 80s. In general, Blue Velvet features the hallmarks of Lynch's famous later work (Twin Peaks season 1, Mulholland Drive etc). As usual, the results are creepy and memorable and Angelo Badalamenti's score is romantic and has a note of classic Hollywood to it. Worth seeing. I can't believe that the same guy who directed Blue Velvet is the same of great, dark and real surrealistic films like Eraserhead (1977) or Lost Highway (1997). I can barely think on what was going on in Lynch's head to do this awful, plot less, boring piece of crappy cinema.<br/><br/>I know there's an intention to show the "dark underworld" running beneath a calm, seemingly serene town, but that's just not enough to sustain a movie. The "dark and sinister journey" seems to be taken of a teen movie. There's nothing like a descent of a man into madness, with the lines of moral vanishing. It's just high schools kids taking on a small gang of gangsters.<br/><br/>The dialogs are stupid, they seem out of place. The plot is ethereal. And there's the ending. I won't spoil anything, but let me say it seems taken of a Disney movie. Don't waste your time watching this. I only give it 3 out of 10 because, compared to most actual movies, it's a good film. But it's not. It doesn't work as a surreal movie, it doesn't work as a crime movie. It doesn't work as an "anything" movie". If you want to see Lynch at his best, go watch Lost Highway or, better, Eraserhead. I went into this movie with the highest of expectations.  A dark comedy about the dark side of American suburbia, with Dennis Hopper as the definitive movie nutcase... how could any self-respecting cult movie fan resist a movie like that?  And the first twenty minutes had me really believing I was watching a great work of art.  The first sequence after the opening credits is pure cinematic brilliance, a stingingly comic riff on middle America that could just as easily have opened a Kubrick film. <br/><br/>
Now if only the rest of the film lived up to those first twenty minutes, we'd really have something.  Blue Velvet is one of the most uneven movies I've ever seen.  The segments focusing on the romance between Jeffrey and Sandy are boring enough to nearly put me to sleep every time I watch them, but every moment with Dennis Hopper is chillingly powerful filmmaking.  This is easily the performance of Hopper's career.  He brings a naive, childlike quality to Frank that takes the character beyond just another obscenity-shouting villain and makes him into a figure of real tragedy. From the very first time he enters the frame and yells at Isabella Rosselini to shut up, we sense that he's just as much a prisoner as she is.  But the rest of the film doesn't work as drama or satire or even hardcore weirdness like much of David Lynch's work.  You can find all the ideas and themes and comments on society in this film you could ever want, but if the movie isn't entertaining or interesting then it's not worth it.  There was a lot of potential here, but in the end the film just doesn't work. I saw this film in '86 when it premiered and watched it decades later. I had the same and only reaction--all I recall is a full frontal of Isabella Rossellini doing a mad scene in the streets. Frankly it would have been more interesting if it had been a nude male actor instead! Poor Is--was she so smitten with Lynch that she did anything he told her? Is there dialogue? I don't recall any. I remember images--a mechanical bird, a severed finger, a dumb blond girl and a post pubescent boy who's an idiot. There is a madman in it but there always is in Lynch films so nothing new there. Poor Dennis dragged out of mothballs yet again to play another crazy. The film like most Lynch films resembles more what would happen if you spliced together pieces of film you found on the cutting room floor. All you come out with is a feeling of uncomfortable disgust kind of like you'd get if you shat in your pants by accident. Say hello to what is perhaps Lynch's greatest achievement so far. And, with a career like his, that sure does mean something. Every film he made is a remarkable and valuable asset to cinema - masterpieces in their own kind - and Blue Velvet is the absolute highlight for sure. Blue Velvet is the representation of the 'small town'-nightmare, complete with raw drama aspects and shocking realism. Without even trying that hard, Lynch successfully mixes a bunch of taboo subjects here like voyeurism, masochism, corruption, aggression and sodomy. The basic plot might look surprisingly simple, but Lynch tells it to the viewer in a very slow and fascinating way.constantly adding one new element at the time. This simple but effective style instrument really builds up an unbearable tension and a unique morbid atmosphere. Lynch already showed a lot of interest towards the dark side of humanity in his black and white cult film Eraserhead, and he expands this bizarre preference in Blue Velvet. Like no other director, he creates a nightmarish and anti-social universe of which you certainly don't want to be a part of. The most extravagant icon is without a doubt the character of Frank Booth.easily the biggest bastard who ever appeared on the big screen. Amazingly brought to life by Dennis Hopper, this mad mobster is the portrayal of everything that is inhuman and despicable. Every word that comes out of Frank's mouth is either aggressive .or perverted. He's a violent and abusive addict who doesn't seem to have the slightest bit of human emotions or behavior.  Dennis Hopper owns this movie and leaves behind the biggest impression you'll ever experience. Blue Velvet contains so many memorable sequences and unforgettable aspects that it's almost impossible to write a summary. Also, it would be a darn shame to spoil anything. The less you know about it before watching, the better.  Let 'Blue Velvet' overwhelm you.rate it 10 out of 10 on this site. and join the fan-base!<br/><br/>One scene I'm willing to describe a little (if it were only to encourage you to watch this film) is Dean Stockwell's terrific little escapade on Roy Orbison's `In Dreams' It's impossible to watch this scene without getting cold shivers all over, I assure you. Perhaps the most stunning and atmospheric sequence in all 80's cinema.What are you waiting for?!? Go out and buy Blue Velvet on DVD! Well, now that I've seen BLUE VELVET, I am left feeling perplexed. While parts of the film were incredibly strange and self-indulgent, the last half of the film is terrific. It's like director David Lynch has a lot of great ability but he's also hampered by a need to too often go "over the top"--which is odd, as one of his first films, ELEPHANT MAN, was rather restrained and very approachable. However, this is the same director who brought us ERASERHEAD and DUNE--two films, like BLUE VELVET, that have tons and tons of divergent views towards the films. Some have hailed these films as genius while others have reviled them for being too weird, too gross and too stylized to be taken seriously. Overall, this is one of his films that I hate and really, really like at the same time.<br/><br/>What's to hate? Well, where to begin?! First, the basic plot of Kyle MacLachlan finding an ear isn't a bad start, but it defied all common sense when the cop investigating told him to "forget about the case"--yet Kyle, who is NOT to be mistaken for a macho action-hero, decides to investigate the case for himself!! Is he a private detective or does he even carry a gun? No--he's just a guy who works in a hardware store!!!! Does this make any sense at all? Nope. Second, when he does get caught up in the mess behind the ear, the film is so filled with repellent people and bizarreness that you really lose track of the plot. This is especially true to the character played by Dennis Hopper--as he played the most unsubtle character in the history of American film!! A huffing, psychotic, super-pervert whose every third word end in "uck" sure catches your attention--but is this believable AND does this performance overshadow the entire film--abso-freakin'-lutely. I truly felt that had Hopper's character been toned down just a bit (mostly in the first scenes--he was better later), many more of the audience wouldn't have walked out on the film (and that did apparently happen a lot when it debuted).<br/><br/>However, I can't just write this film off as a freak show (though it is, to a degree). There's actually a very, very good second half of the film. Provided you can ignore the plot holes and the similarity between this film and FREAKS, you are left with a film that is, believe it or not, very similar to NORTH BY NORTHWEST. While Kyle certainly isn't to be mistaken for Cary Grant and the violent sex isn't to be confused with the sexual innuendo with Eva Marie Saint in the Hitchcock film, you can see how both characters are ordinary guys who are tossed into the middle of something big and crazy. I loved the last portion of the film because the tension was so extreme and the final confrontation between good and evil was great.<br/><br/>I see this film as an interesting but very flawed film that should never be seen by anyone who isn't an adult. However, I realize that the film has 'cult' written all over it--many, many people adore it while many more just don't understand it and don't want to! Place me square in the middle--it's not trash nor is it genius. I decide to watch this film because of all the hype surrounding it, and after 20 minutes or so I instantly regretted it.
By the time the credits arrived I was bored out of my skull, and I consider it a waste of 2 hours I will never get back. As for the much touted nudity and violence?, are you kidding me?, this film was a joke, there was barely any nudity at all, and if that's the viewers cup of tea, you will be far better off watching "Baise Moi", or "All about Anna"....at least those films have far more decent nudity, erotica, and were realistically done
The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen, and perhaps the only redeeming feature of this film was Dennis Hopper, yet the acting was so over the top, it was laughable, as if you're watching a bad performance or something.....Dennis Hopper gives a far more gritty performance in the film "Speed"
This film was literally boring as heck, and it went nowhere for me
Avoid at all costs Supposedly a movie classic, Blue Velvet does not sit on any level near this factor. Instead, upon the very lowest of the low types of films around. David Lynch, who CAN BE a brilliant director cant forge his mastery on this pathetic film,and in my view Lynchs worst film to date, along with the pretentious dribble Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive. Every aspect in every scene fails to live up to a good film. The acting, apart from Dennis Hopper, is absolutely horrendous and wooden, and the plot is simply semi-pornographic disguised as art.<br/><br/>A horribly pretentious movie, which has somehow received very positive responses. Blue Velvet is one of those movies that can provide you with an enchanting experience. I have seen it several times and every single time when I watch it again, I feel like it is my first time seeing it. And that's not because the movie's plot is something extraordinary, but because it has that unique atmosphere, which can only be found in Lynch's works.<br/><br/>Of course, like all other movies directed by Lynch, Blue Velvet can't suit everyone's taste. It might seem weird and too sexualized. But after all its the oversexualization and weirdness that make this movie so great.<br/><br/>Everyone should see Blue Velvet at least once because unlike other movies where you can just read the summary and understand whether it suits your taste or not, Blue Velvet has to be experienced in order for you to figure out whether you like it or not. First, the plot lacks credibility. Jeffrey's father gets a serious stroke and Jeffrey should be more concerned with his father. However, in the movie, Jeffrey acts like a SJW and a pervert. He messes up with a married woman Dorothy, and fights with the bad guys that torture Dorothy. Jeffrey almost ignores his father. <br/><br/>Secondly, the storytelling is horrible. Telling a simple story in a complicated way, is the last thing a director should do. The narrative is just unfocused. What is the point of the sex scene between Dorothy and Jeffrey? <br/><br/>Third, character development is a total failure. Who does Jeffrey love? Dorothy or Sandy? I'm afraid even himself does not have an answer. Why does Sandy give up on Mike? What is in her mind? The main antagonist, Frank, is just flat and one-dimensional, and nobody knows his motive. He is just a psychopath? <br/><br/>Fourth, the music score is strange. It always appears at an improper time with no purpose.<br/><br/>Finally, with nothing in stake, there is no thrill at all. It should not be called a thriller. Instead, we can categorize it as a non-thriller. <br/><br/>All in all, the rating for this movie is 0/10. I had heard of this film for years but wasn't inclined to purchase it, so figured I'd never see it. Well it comes on late one night on STARZ so realize I'll finally see it... This is one wild ass flick, I couldn't get over Rossellini's wig (made me think of Rocky Horror too much). It's a very odd movie that's incredibly unsettling, mainly Hopper's character. I prefer movies where it's understood why things happen the way they do (there was never any explanation of why Frank had Dorothy's family). I also didn't understand Kyle M's delivery, I just didn't understand his character at all. It's a movie I won't forget anytime soon but it won't necessarily be for good reasons. Where do I begin? For starters, Blue Velvet rocked my world. I'm not sure the exact word to describe this film from David Lynch, but I think I'll start with unnerving. From the start, you are drawn in by the happy suburban lifestyle drenched in light colors and sunshine into an immediate deep zoom on the insects roaming the grass below. It is a direct juxtaposition that throws the viewer off and really made me feel uncomfortable. Was I about to watch a horror movie? Drama? I had no idea and as the film unfolded, I think it was clear that it was drawing a little from every genre...even its own.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, Blue Velvet will change the way you watch movies forever. Some scenes last long, some are cut short, the cheesy dialogue fits the suburban setting (and then is cut short when darkness intervenes) and Frank Booth is absolutely terrifying. It is also extremely ahead of its time. Watching this movie, you can see where Tarantino drew a lot of his influence in his realism, creative camera angles, violence, character development and so much more. <br/><br/>This was the second Lynch film I watched as it truly shows the viewer the real art behind making a lasting film and how to really throw your viewer for a loop. I didn't trust a soul throughout the movie, which directly led to its level of terror and unnerving that worked so well. Dennis Hopper is out of this world as villain Frank Booth and I'm telling you it's a performance unlike any I've ever seen. It makes you wonder just how much of it is acting for Hopper, as he truly immerses in this monster and never lets up. Unnerving is an understatement throughout his scenes.<br/><br/>On the surface, Blue Velvet is a crime noir, psychological mystery/thriller (I think), but when you press play, you will quickly realize that it is much more. With some amazing music filling the film as well, David Lynch quickly became one of my favorite directors and showed me that if you want to make a movie or film something, just start doing it. There may be rules, but rules are only there to be broken. I don't know if it's due to the format (a VHS tape), the dubbing (French) or my personal situation (medical exam) but i didn't catch the movie this time ! Sure it's beautifully shot, it has an amazing soundtrack and great musical performances, it's small town USA with bright colors, dark mysteries but at the end, i found the story rather weak and above all, the cast really badly assembled ! Rosselini may be a charming Italian babe with a taste for borderline, she left me totally cold here: between her heavy wig and her intimate life, i just didn't care for her Next and worse, Hooper is just ridiculous as the bad guy ! He belongs to this group of actors that i just dislike as they just destroy every movie they are in : they think they are bright, talented but i just see bragging studs who overacts for poor effects ! Here, it's really over the top as this bad guy has too much perversion and stupid habits ! So, except the musical moments, this movie was such a bore that I fast forwarded with pleasure ! I think its only interest would be to tie every shot with another Lynch's movie as Lynch really shots and re-shots the same motifs, places over and over : the closet, the brown bedroom, the night road, the luminous cozy living room, . At the beginning of this rather peculiar film, we see a peaceful scene of a bed of beautiful red roses facing a white picket fence. Bobby Vinton's title song of 1963 is playing. Smartly dressed children walk to school. An elderly man, watering a lawn, sustains a stroke and falls down. Suddenly the camera and our focus are below the surface, where the insects (beetles) struggle for survival in the nether world. So it is that we are in a typically nice suburban town of Lumberton with nice folks and all, a sleepy community. But what lies below the perfect plane? The decay lying underground. Ah, symbolism. David Lynch, always the master, knows how to use that and color, shadow, and camera angles to good effect. <br/><br/>A regular young man, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), home during a school (college) break, cuts across a vacant and littered lot. He is concerned about his father, who had the stroke. Catching his attention is a severed human ear lying on the ground, covered with insects. He picks it up and soon contacts local detective Williams at the police station, who, although supportive at first, later seems apathetic. Afterward he tells Jeffrey to "forget about the case." But William's blonde daughter Sandy (Laura Dern, a prim and proper girl-next-door type – who often wears white, symbolic of innocence and purity) – is helpful and provides information that she has learned simply by being the daughter of a detective. So Jeffrey and Sandy, obsessed, become amateur detectives, and do things that regular folks would not dream of, like getting themselves over-involved in the underbelly of a perverse world. Actually the burden really falls upon Jeffrey, who, after gaining additional information from Sandy, first makes a visit in disguise as a "bugman" (bug exterminator = a killer of beetles?) to the starkly colored apartment of lounge singer Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rossellini) to gather details. Since Dorothy is obviously involved in something aberrant, Jeffrey decides to return to her place after he takes a key. <br/><br/>Before long we are introduced to psychotic Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), exceedingly evil, an all-time screen villain-deluxe who lacks any redeeming quality. The depraved Frank is a sadistic murderer on drugs. It seems that he has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son, and is using Dorothy for his sadistic, sexual outlet ("Mommy!"). And Dorothy seems to like it, even though she is concerned about her husband and young son, both of whom remain prisoner at the place of Ben (Dean Stockwell). Earlier the brutal Frank Booth had used a scissor to cut off Mr. Valens' left ear, to keep everyone in line. Jeffrey's "investigation" uncovers the illegal activities of the "Booth gang," and several mysterious personalities like the Yellow Man (Fred Pickler) and the Well-Dressed Man with a mustache and briefcase.<br/><br/>Jeffrey's fixation gets him into hot water. Frank sees him leaving Dorothy's apartment, so Frank and gang take him on a "joyride." (Would you want to go anywhere with degenerate Frank?) The first stop is oddball Ben's place where weird people act as abnormally as they can. Are they all stoned/drunk? Then it is to a deserted sand and gravel operation. There, Jeffrey gets a beating but does survive; during the nest few days people notice and comment about his "bad face-lift." Jeffrey then provides documentation to Detective Williams about everything he knows about Frank. Williams notes the pictures of the Yellow Man, who is actually Detective Gordon and Williams' partner in law-enforcement. Why is he involved with Frank? And who is this well-dressed man with the mustache? Absorbing what Jeffrey has told him, Williams now expresses concern. Events are soon fast-forwarded. <br/><br/>The last crime montage is totally bizarre, especially with the upright posture of the "stiff" Yellow Man. What happened? Doesn't Yellow Man/Gordon know that Mr. Well-Dressed is really ? Yellow Man cannot be remotely clean, but why do we not have more information? Then one is reminded that Director Lynch apparently made three or four hours of film that was reduced by the producers. That fact may be the reason why the movie has some perceptible gaps in logic. Thankfully some really gross-out scenes were removed. One of the last tableaux is that of a robin, and we soon notice a beetle in its mouth. Remembering the introductory scene with the beetle struggling below ground, we realize that the film has gone around and come around. The bad guy may be gone, but the vice is still there. <br/><br/>This is not a beautiful or family film, with its gruesome sites and language and nudity and mannerisms of Frank, but certainly is an effective one. For one thing, the acting is top notch. It had better be, as Lynch is demanding. Moreover the characters are memorable. The plot is straightforward, although it may require more than one viewing to get the understanding of it. And although the imagery is disturbing, the movie is gripping. So, although it is forbidding at times, see it and find out. Some rate the picture on the Top 100 Movies of All Time List although it is NOT for all tastes. This was only the second time I've seen it but i think its vastly overrated. It starts off well, kind of like its TV cousin Twin Peaks, but everything goes absurdly over the top half way through. The vague comedy elements are poor and the film just completely goes astray with all of its subliminal messages. In addition, Kyle MacLachlan is a remarkably wooden actor; the plot frequently falls apart; and Lynch's bursts of (sometimes pretentious) surrealism are occasionally miscalculated and actually tend to get in the way of any coherent statement.<br/><br/>In three separate occasions last week I saw this regarded as a 'classic' or a 'masterpiece' and have spotted it on many top ten lists. I asked the man at my video store, and he highly recommended it. Now its just an utter disappointment its such a weak film. Blue Velvet is a masterpiece of modern cinema and neo-noir. It is veiled in mysteries that I still have not cracked after more than 10 viewings. It is simply one of my favorite films. Blue Velvet is a particularly well acted film. Dennis Hopper is incredible. His role as Frank Booth has been ranked as one of the best villains in cinema history. Isabella Rossellini also did a miraculous job as Dorothy Vallens. Her portrayal, which even Roger Ebert found impressive, is sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes heartwarming, which is quite an amazing thing to accomplish in her first film role ever. <br/><br/>While Blue Velvet is one of David Lynch's more "conventional" films, it still holds that mysterious, hard to crack aspect that David is so great at creating. It contains little details that allow you to discover more with each viewing. Blue Velvet is also loaded with clever, deep symbolism and imagery that keeps you astounded every time you see it -- which makes it a totally original film on every viewing. The blue lighting, the picket fence and flowers, the well-dressed man disguise, the kink in the hoes during Jeffery's father's stroke are all examples of the amazing imagery found in Blue Velvet. If you have never seen it, do so as soon as possible. You should not be disappointed. Perhaps David Lynch's most popular cinematic effort, Blue Velvet was as emphatic in its depiction of women as subservient to men that Lynch was actually accused of misogyny. However, you should see through this. Although initially, I saw the film as highly pretentious (it came across as if it was taking itself way to seriously) and extremely exploitive, it was recently aired on TV and I decided to re-watch it. I've come to the realization that this is a very finely crafted movie with a diverse selection of talented actors.<br/><br/>In a town overwhelmed by bright white picket fences, coffee-drinking mothers, blood red fire trucks, cozy homes and carefully pruned roses, there's something especially grotesque about a man having a heart attack on his front lawn while his cocker spaniel laps spraying water from the hose still clinging to his hand. Blue Velvet is a film about the reality and streams of subconscious desire seething beneath a preposterously idealistic vision of America. Jeffrey discovers a severed, ant-infested human ear near a grassy trail (Lynch's homage to Luis Buñuel's famous classic Un Chien Andalou), bringing it to the attention of the local police chief. With the help of Sandy (Laura Dern), a naive, All-American girl-next-door who emerges hauntingly from the shadows and promises her devotion to his mission, Jeffrey sneaks into the apartment owned by an emotionally frayed nightclub chanteuse, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini, doing her best impersonation of a living china doll with especially red lips). He finds out probably more than he initially planned. Dorothy is working as a sex-slave for drug addicted, sadistic madman Frank Booth. Booth is also holding Dorothy's husband and son captive, so in order for them to stay alive, Dorothy must perform perverse, degrading favors for Frank. In a town were Awake magazines are readily associated with Jehovah's Witnesses, Dennis Hopper's Frank becomes a kind of satanic assault on normalcy. He's a rapist and kidnapper and if Dorothy's desire to be physically hit by Jeffrey is any indication, Frank's perversion easily spreads. But, then again, Lynch seems to suggest that love is as potent in Frank's fetishistic strange world as it is in Sandy's happy-go-lucky one. Even when the robins do return to Lumberton, Lynch still forces his characters to acknowledge the grotesque backside of their idyllic worldviewsand hints that perhaps the images we see at the end are an echo of those we saw at the start. Is happiness restored permanently in Lumberton, or will it return? And if so, when? Easily David Lynch's best film and one of the best films ever made. I'm not sure that it is best seen on DVD - it works best in the cinema but failing that a very dark room. This is a film that you need to engage with; it is not one to watch in bits and pieces or with interruptions. Its about the experience. Having said that, its probably best to watch this with someone, it will certainly give you chills, in the vain that Psycho did for audiences in the 60s.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful film - full of amazing imagery and fantastic cinematography - it is also very dark and disturbing film but laced with humour and many funny moments.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper steals the show as Frank but he is well supported by Isabella Rossellini and Dean Stockwell. The two main characters Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are wooden but this is strangely effective.<br/><br/>In short, an unforgettable film that deserves to be embraced as one of the greatest films ever made, but not for the faint hearted. This film is probably the most brilliant thriller films ever made and it works on many levels. Its a neo-noir depiction on a terrible society hidden beneath a beautiful, 1950s-style kind off sitcom American town. I then digs deeper in the dark-hearted world of America; introduces haunting characters such as the unforgettable villain...played by Frank Booth, who clearly deserved an Oscar nomination, let alone win, from the Academy. MacLachlan is amazing, he goes from shallow and wooden, and as the mystery builds, he becomes strong and bold. The supporting cast is wonderful, lead by the amazing Isabella Rossellini (who meets the skill of her mother, Ingrid Bergam in this film).<br/><br/>David Lynch is a genius filmmaker, and Blue Velvet is one of his most accomplished, beautiful pieces of work. Its art-house, that mad a lasting and controversial impact on mainstream cinema. Today, the film is considered a classic and is basically showered in praise. Funny how films can fail upon their initial release, but have such recognition later on.<br/><br/>To summarize my thoughts, Blue Velvet is a masterpiece. It is a sophisticated and complex film, memorable both in style and substance. It has so many aspects that can be discussed that I haven't gone through here such as the imagery, themes, metaphors the iconography, the representation of America and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>The film is a view on life in turmoil. It deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history. In fact, eternal remembrance. 10/10. To hear a Lynch movie is sometimes enough to get it, and to disappear in it. The movie's opening shows us a hear, cut from a face, which tells us not to watch closely, but to listened carefully. "Blue Velvet" could have been a song, a naive and creepy song at the same time, like a Roy Orbisson's song. "In Dreams" is like the movie : a dark mixture of terrifying mystery and childish games, of romanticism and perversity, of madness hidden under the beauty. This could have been ridiculous, if it wasn't mesmerizing. <br/><br/>"A Candy-colored clown they call the sandman".<br/><br/>Something is happening right in front of Jeffrey (Kyle MacLaclan)'s eyes, but it won't affect him, until he meets Dorothy Vallens, who escape from a hidden and forbidden world, and seems able to show it to Jeffrey.<br/><br/>Like in a Roy Orbisson's song, her last words will be "I'm falling". She felt from a dark universe to an idyllic one, where Jeffrey and Sandy live the empty life of a shallow TV sitcom. From that impersonal world (where personalty doesn't exist : he calls himself "Jeffrey nothing" when he's asked for his name), they 'll discover a reverse world, where everything hidden in their universe - drugs, violence, perversion - is now lighten. It's like Tintin visiting Gotham City. <br/><br/>Lincoln Avenue - the reverse and forgotten world of Dorothy Wallens - is the kingdom of the Jocker Frank Booth, a monstrous "Candy Colored Clown". From the confrontation of the two words, identical but reverse, one will collapse, and it will be Frank's. It's a world too full of death and passion no to be destroy at the sound of a love letter. <br/><br/>But it won't change anything, if the dream succeed to erase the nightmare, the dreamer stays a madman. From the film the old ladies watch to the strange and frozen stereotypes that open and close the movie, everything always stays bizarre, odd, suspicious and strange. If the nightmare disappears, where does the dream go ? "You're like me", says Frank to Jeffrey. And he's right, for it's Jeffrey that creates this decadent story, and disguised himself in a peeping Tom and in a killer. And what does he find when he opens his eyes at the end : a world which has lost all its reality. And Franklin street's stays a mystery, and still belongs to dreams.<br/><br/>"Into the magic night I softly say A silent prayer, like dreamers do Then I fall asleep to dream of you"<br/><br/>"You're like me" means that if Frank is Jeffrey's dream, Jeffrey's also Frank's dream, and that their all existence is an illusion. In Lynch' it's the fear of non existence that thrills the characters : they have to become the decor in order to not disappear. "I'm Paul, who are you ?", without identification, you're losing yourself, erased by somebody else's dream.<br/><br/>"It's too bad that all this things, can only happen in my dreams. Only in dreams, in beautiful dreams."<br/><br/>From the sadness arises the morbid beauty of Lynch's movie. But like always, everything looks like a dream trying to reach reality. You're disease is in me! There are few movies out there that can bring to mind opposite emotions at the same time. Erotic and disgusting, scary and funny, boring and colorful are all appropriate descriptions for different scenes in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie has the habit of adding tension to a scene that the characters seem to find very normal. At other times the thrills won't let up.<br/><br/>However, I have a few complaints I can't ignore. (spoilers herein) 1)At one point the lead cop allows his daughter to rush into a room with him where they both just heard a gunshot come from. No officer would ever let any civilian rush in with them, especially their teenage daughter.<br/><br/>2)When the main character's 'love' discovers he had sex with another woman, she forgives him within 2 seconds of him saying 'he's sorry'. Then they go into 'I love you!'s. I've dated my share of women and no female would EVER react like that...... ever..... never..... believe me..... nope.<br/><br/>3)The lead bad guy kidnaps this young man for suspicion and jealousy. He takes him to the scene of his main crime, lets him witness drug abuse, and finally beats him just to let him go. Very anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie, specific scenes I would rate '9'. Overall '6/10'. This is truly David Lynch's masterpiece, because it easily combines his standard weirdness and a good narrative.<br/><br/>The opening really sums up whats going to happen; you see red roses against white picket fences, the local fireman waving, then a man watering his lawn. he suddenly has a stroke and falls down still holding the hose, a dog innocently laps the water in slow motion, then the camera ventures down to see under the grass their are black insects squirming. that is world where Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachalan) will experience.<br/><br/>Jeffrey has returned to his hometown of Lumberton while his father recovers from a stroke. Accidentally Jeffrey finds a severed human ear in a field, and is lead to a darker side to Lumberton.<br/><br/>He finds this darkness in Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini) and her abusive relationship with Frank Booth a local drug dealer and psycho (played to mad-cap perfection by Dennis Hopper). Jeffrey is now stuck between 2 different worlds, the dark with Frank and Dorothy or the light with Sandy (Laura Dern), which will he choose?<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is filled with great moments; the opening scene of surreal visions of The Amercian Dream, Jeffrey hiding in Dorothy's closet while Frank symbiotically rapes/abuses her, Frank suave friend Ben (Dean Stockwell in a weird but striking role) lip-syncing "In Dreams" into a lamplight and others.<br/><br/>A great film noir/mystery/ experimental film from the massive imagination of David Lynch,one of the best directors still working today. Writer and Director David Lynch loves to torture his audience with a stiff left jab. He is not only one step ahead of the rest of us. He's so far ahead we may never catch up. But Lynch takes mercy on his viewers, while delivering perhaps his most endearing classic with the masterful 'Blue Velvet.' When young Jeffrey, played by the underrated Kyle McLachlan, returns home from school following his father's sudden and serious illness, He takes a shortcut on the way home from the hospital. While angling through a vacant lot he makes a ghastly discovery. A severed human ear lying on the ground. Curious, he sets out to solve the mystery of who it might belong to. Along this path he meets up with somebody else's high school sweetheart, ( Laura Dern ) and they set out to solve this puzzle while heating the incubation of their growing love. From the opening scene, when Lynch shows us a passing fire truck right off the cover of the Saturday Evening Post, we realize that this film is more about the things we can't see then the things we can. Lynch has a very artistic way of showing you these examples of goodness. Only to make you shiver when he drags you underneath the streets to show you the evil which no society has ever been totally free of. In this case that evil's name is Frank, played by screen icon Dennis Hopper in an amazing performance which might be his best in a career which spans almost fifty years. Frank is a bad man who is inexplicably tormenting a broken down lounge singer ( Isabella Rosallini ) as Jeffrey discovers through his unauthorized detective work. McLachlan is clean cut and polite as the innocent Jeffry. And so handsome that he purposely represents the athletic ideal in another example of the good which Lynch keeps teasing us with. As for Laura Dern as his partner in crime fighting and maybe more. I don't see her as the beauty queen for which she is so often cast. But I can't deny that she is a good actress and her performance is worthy. But Hopper as the deranged Frank dominates the screen. His viciousness bellies everything Lynch has shown us when relating to the Elm Streets of Jeffrey's Northwestern hometown. Hopper captures the insidiousness and violence perfectly while his director begins to deluge our minds with much darker images. When Lynch is criticized it is usually because his films tend to branch off in totally obscure directions. Leaving the audience perplexed and guessing not only at the meaning but wondering if there's even any common sense to it at all. Lynch swears that his films make sense. But to everyone's relief 'Blue Velvet' does come to an explicable conclusion. While it's not exactly your Hollywood ending with a bow on top. No one could call it obscure. Ultimately 'Blue Velvet' is not only Lynch's best film. 'Which is a stellar list in its own right, it could easily be the most daring and beautiful feature of its entire decade. Even people that don't understand him agree, Lynch is a genius. And 'Blue Velvet is his crowning achievement. 10 out of a possible 10 T.H. There are really two ways at looking at this debacle.  One one hand you can put on your film-making hat. When you do this, you see that symbolism and camera work are nearly perfect. You see the real world problems in Lumberton portrayed nearly flawlessly. Dennis Hopper as Frank is gruesome, but perfect (Pabst Blue Ribbon!!). The other characters are not astounding, but they don't need to be. The flow of the movie is logical, and its got a strangely interesting ending... However, if you are watching this movie to be entertained or to be on the edge of your seat, or especially to feel good, you are in the wrong place. It is not something you will watch unless you really like to analyze the art of film. The characters, like I said, are not very dynamic, and there is not much depth. In addition, you wonder why some characters do the things they do. Since when is Jeffrey so brave? And why in the world does Sandy even care about helping him? I don't know, and Lynch knows that I don't know. He apparently doesn't care. Basically this movie is about Lynch showing off his directorial abilities, and I don't blame him for that. Personally, I'm not a big analyzer of film techniques, I just like to be entertained. This movie really didn't do that. I'll give it a 7/10 strictly on the fact the the film making was awesome. If it wasn't, this would be 5.5/10 at best. David Lynch, the director who is also the master of creepiness and darkness, has directed a film called Bule Velvet.  Blue Velvet is dark and creepy, just like the rest of Lynch's films.  It's about a young man who discovers a decapitated ear on his way from the hospital.  The ear, police say, has been cut off with scissors.  This striked me right then.  Scissors.  David Lynch, get it?  Anyway, they get the DNA tests and it belonged to a singer.  So the young man decides to investigate, and ends up falling in love with the singer.  Little does he know her boyfriend Frank is a psycho and also the Frank is keeping the singer's son as a hostage.<br/><br/>Great performances.  This, in 1986, was David Lynch's oscar-nominated directing.  This is the first film I view from David Lynch and all I have to say is that I was and am immediately a fan.  The future of film-noir rests in the hands of this film.  Blue Velvet was actually a very dark drama with much more to it than darkness, but characters that stand very bizzare.  I don't know where the young man gets his courage to try and sneak on the singer, I don't get the singer's craving for someone to slap her, and I certainly don't get Frank's air-mask thing.  That was creepy, and Lynch left the characters a mystery for us.<br/><br/>Some say that the actress that plays the singer has been taken advantage of. News flash!  Her son is kidnapped, her husband's dead and she has a psycho "boyfriend".  She deserves what she gets coming to her.  Don't worry, she doesn't die, if that's what you're thinking.  She just suffers, so she has to feed to her needs.  She actually doesn't stand there like a helpless child, but stands up for her rights.  So no, she isn't taken advantage of.<br/><br/>Laura Dern is in this movie!  I love her!  She plays the young man's other girlfriend.  With everything going on around her, she should have gained an academy award for best supporting actress.  Dennis Hopper plays Frank. Dennis Hopper is an amazing actor, and is really good at playing the bad guy.  Come on!  He played the bad guy in Mario Brothers for God's sake! Anyways, he WAS nominated for best supporting actor, but that was for the golden globes.  I'm glad David Lynch got a nomination for best director. One scene he shows us ants feeding away on other ants, and when a high part comes, and ends, he shows us a candle burning out.  Even when he shows the singer's extremely red lips while she is giving order to slap her, David Lynch's directing shines.<br/><br/>This was one of the most controversial films of the 80's.  Well, it was the 80's.  There wasn't really anything to talk about except for Blue Velvet. Blue Velvet isn't exactly an audience-friendly film.  Some just don't like it because they don't like the "darkness" or it's too "boring", even though it absolutely isn't.  That's a terrible insult for David Lynch.  Only if you are ready to hear "the ear has been cut off with scissors" and prepared for David Lynch's magnificent directing style, see Blue Velvet.  Don't rent this movie to expect another "Gone with the wind", because it's not that kind of drama.  Or even if you are looking for something "different", see Blue Velvet.  If you are too scared to be disapointed, like I was before viewing this film, rent David Lynch's The Straight Story.  Unlike Blue Velvet, The Straight story is "G" rated and completely light.  But come on!  You must love Lynch in his "normal" directing style, so rent Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>Get ready to be amazed.  Blue Velvet has David Lynch written all over it, and in case you hate Lynch and don't like "darkness", go away.  To put it this way, this the first and only film I've seen of David Lynch, and I loved it.  It's that easy.  So, I recommend Blue Velvet to every kind of person I've mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 (RENT IT) Blue Velvet is without a doubt one of the finest films of the 1980s.  It is cinema in its most true and artistic form - every single aspect of the film is symbolic of David Lynch's twisted and somewhat unidentifiable view of this world. They must have fixed the elevator quickly that night towards the finale because all the police and ambulance men were using the from door of Dorothy's building instead of the stairs at the back !<br/><br/>Frank goes to confront Don without ANY weapon ... but he mentioned his father owned a gun at home !<br/><br/>As I said, too many holes to mention, but an acceptable yarn nevertheless .... I delved into watching this film like one of its main characters delves into the mystery of a severed ear he stumbles upon.<br/><br/>Where did the ear come from, why, how. Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) investigates like a Hardy Boy rather than just letting the police do their job.<br/><br/>The story is set in a seemingly sleepy U.S. town but the town has a seedy, dark side that the story envelops.<br/><br/>Jeffreys investigations lead to break ins of apartments, stealing spare keys and becoming an innocent voyeur of the sexual life of a nightclub singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini) who seemingly only has one song in her repertoire, Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>The sexual life of Vallens is violent and features scenes of violence and S:M by her 'partner' Frank (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>Hollywood wild man Hopper seems ideally suited to the role. The role not only shows Frank as sexually very violent but also drug and brothel obsessed.<br/><br/>Rossilini has to act battered, raped, nude. The film is not the sleepy U.S town shown on the cover!<br/><br/>A side story shows Jeffreys blossoming relationship with Sandy Williams (a young Laura Dern) daughter of the police detective.
She is innocently tagged in Jeffreys investigations like a Nancy Drew character and has to watch her own love of Jeffrey being threatened by Vallens who finds security in Jeffrey whilst at the same time making Jeffrey act like violent Frank.<br/><br/>The story develops showing the severed ear I mentioned earlier came from Vallens kidnapped husband.<br/><br/>Directed by David Lynch who was nominated for Best Director in the 1987 Academy Awards.<br/><br/>I didn't really 'click' with the film.
Frank is to violent and sexually abusive. One could say perverted especially in scenes where he visits a brothel with a captured Jeffrey in tow.<br/><br/>I've watched the film twice with a gap of a couple of years and I have found it one of the most difficult films to review. Its really a pointless movie. It developes a good deal of suspense, which leads up to tjis fairly lame confrontation betwern Jeffery and Frank Booth at the end. Hopper is so anmoying as the psychopathic pervert, one almost wishes that his character had been killed the first time he appears. Lynches attempt at marrying Middle Class normality with a dark underworld is a failure in my opinion for the simple reason that it's not very entertaining. Even Fire Walk With Me was more fun. Honestly don't know how this has a higher rating than 2 because the plot is limited and the scenes get rarer and rarer as you go on! The dialog is awful, the character Frank only say one thing and it's the F word! Blue Velvet is a mystery film that gives an honest shot at showing how strange this world really is. It is a solid noir style thriller but with a nice Lynchian touch.<br/><br/>I think it's packed with symbolism that I'm too dumb to understand, but it might be about life and death itself. For example; a bird eating a bug, flowers, sex and violence. It could also be about self harm; the need for abuse, the oxygen mask or the constant beer drinking or maybe it's about listening; birds singing, severed ear, rumors in a small town, police radios.<br/><br/>I wasn't entirely satisfied with how everything turned out because I wanted to know more about motivations and such but maybe that interferes with the randomness of the real world that it might want to represent.
But all in all it is a good film. Worth mentioning: Dennis Hopper's acting was brilliant and frightening.<br/><br/>A must watch if you like David Lynch.<br/><br/>7/10 Lynch's best work. The great colour and cinematography usage, great music. Whole plot involves a mystery which is revealed pretty fast and then it becomes a suspenseful thriller. It's weird, you will question many things you see, but in the end you'll understand everything even through nothing will be explained. "Blue Velvet" is a 1986 thriller directed by David Lynch starring Isabella Rossellini and Kyle MacLachlan. I thought I'd start the new week with some eighties greatness in the form of this Lynch classic. By now, I've only seen two thirds of the psychological trilogy of the infamously eccentric director and was always blasted away by the disturbing imagery and absolutely mind-blowing plot twists. Hence I knew that this feature film would not disappoint me either. Admittedly, I was expecting similar weird stuff, what eventually wasn't exactly what this film depicted, but that doesn't mean that I'm disappointed by it. What amazed me the most is how the film manges to pull off a clean genre shift that doesn't destroy the film's atmosphere in the slightest. In the beginning, it slowly begins to establish itself as a mystery thriller with countless clues I expected to be resolved in the most disturbing manner possible. The voyeuristic curiosity that is one of Jeffrey's main features positively reminded me of a classic Hitchcock protagonist. This influence is palpable throughout the story and a well done homage to the master of suspense. Also, the unsuspicious character constellation created the right atmosphere in the first place. It's full of said suspense and as Jeffrey begins to unravel more and more secrets, the atmosphere shifts accordingly. It happens so smoothly that you don't even take notice of it while watching it. The main cast is too hypnotizing to to let you notice it. From an alluring Rossellini, over a convincing young Laura Dern to a charismatic MacLachlan, they all perform decently. But the highlight of the film is Dennis Hopper as the mental antagonist of the film. He steals the show in every scene he's in and his incalculable and menacing nature is definitely a massive threat that makes you worry about the other characters immensely. This being said, the story begins to pull the main character into an unexpected abyss of crime and violence. It more and more begins to feel like a classic film noir, as it wonderfully combines the tropes of the sub-genre with enough originality and even a complicated love story. Lynch knows how to weave together the correct pieces to create a packing thriller. Furthermore, the whole atmosphere has an effect on me I've rarely felt before. The film's obviously set in a realistic scenery without anything paranormal happening, yet it at times feels absolutely surreal and I couldn't quite believe the way too happy end. But the robin metaphor confirmed the real world aspect in the last minute. All in all, David Lynch has once again proven that he's one of the best non mainstream directors in the business, as he's created a well crafted and original piece of a suspenseful thriller that Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of. A moody genre mix with stellar acting performances, enough thrill and a camera work intimate enough to make you feel this film closely. A terrifying experience that leaves you in edge for days afterward. Blue Velvet is written and directed by David Lynch. It stars Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Hope Lange, George Dickerson and Dean Stockwell. Music is by Angelo Badalamenti and cinematography by Frederick Elmes.<br/><br/>The discovery of a severed human ear found in a field leads Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan) into a vortex of troubled mysteries involving a beautiful nightclub singer and a group of crimninals led by the psychopathic Frank Booth (Hopper).<br/><br/>Such is the diversity of David Lynch, you will find many anouncing this to be his last accessible piece of genius, others that it was merely the start of his shift into mainstream majesty. Personally, I just find it a fine movie, easy to follow, even if it's nightmarish at times and brilliantly off kilter at others.<br/><br/>From the off we are in no doubt that Lynch is setting out to show what crawls beneath the happy facade of suburban small town Americana. We are pitched into a detective story with a difference, one that is fronted by the naivety of a young man aided from the sidelines by the young girl who is falling for him. Both of them stumble into a world of adult pschosexual murk, flanked by the outrageous malignant menace of Booth and his merry band of odd balls. One of the joys to be had here is observing the things and reactions that Booth's group do in the background, splendidly weird. Superbly perfomed by the cast, most of them daring and real for their director, Blue Velvet did earn Lynch a Best Director Oscar nomination. Which considering it was 1986 and the controversial themes at work are troublingly biting, makes the nomination something of a surprise.<br/><br/>Frederick Elmes also photographed the equally controversial "River's Edge" this same year, and once again he considerably pumps Neo-Noir textures acrosss the pic. While Angelo Badalamenti's musical compositions are lush and pin sharp for scene accompaniments. Main music tracks are Bobby Vinton's title tune and Roy Orbison's "In Dreams," both certain to never let you forget this film whenever you hear them again. Lynch's film is plot conventionality, yet disturbing in the blending of beauty and violence, both visually and orally - and of course there's some sly humour to be found as well. To me it's not the masterpiece some claim it as, for there's more style than substance, more shock and awe as opposed to character depth, but it is a great, clever and unforgettable film. 8/10 I long ago decided not to watch any more David Lynch films, as he always does the same thing - he'll start an intriguing plot but then go right off the rails into a fantasyland populated by strange, unnecessary characters each with their own collection of loose ends and oddball habits. However, after watching a TV doc about Mr Lynch I had the urge to see Blue Velvet for the first time in many years. And boy was I glad I did. It's probably the most watchable of his films as it stays more-or-less on track and at least the weird segments are part of the story. It is also beautifully photographed, with a sheen of quality and high production values. Plenty of homages and references to spot, including a 'Zampi Bar', which I took to be a nod to the producer/director Mario Zampi, maker of many good films including some classic British comedies. This is a film to watch several times and discover the zillion little touches that make it so good, even if you don't know why. I also did a brief review of the movie. If you are interested in Cult movies from the past, go check out my blog and leave a comment. The dreaminess of the visuals is interwoven with the reality of some seriously dark and twisted characters, and the reality of life in a small town that's "normal" on the surface is shown to be just a dream that Americans have of themselves. Dreams and reality are warped and wound together in this "strange world," and the critique of wholesome Americana with all of its kitsch 50's tunes and small town vibe seems especially appropriate to the Reagan era. I like the meaning behind it, but it was too dark in its scenes of BDSM/misogyny for my taste, especially in how Isabella Rossellini was treated (in her role and as an actor). The story and dialogue are extremely simple so despite a strong start, it didn't work for me as a neo-noir either. That might have been part of the point, just how banal some of these characters are, but it needed more intelligence in something other than Lynch's distinctive aesthetic and visual flair. In the seemingly pleasant small town of Lumberton, North Carolina: Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is a college student temporarily returning home due to a health situation in his family. After discovering something odd in a field while out for a walk, his curiosity leads him to the underworld of Lumberton as he encounters a troubled, mysterious lounge singer: Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini); and a sadistic, insane, violent criminal: Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>Two scenes are outstanding and are the highlights of the film. In each, Jeffrey encounters the mysterious world that includes Dorothy and Frank. The first gives the audience (and Jeffrey) a taste of this odd world; the second gives Jeffrey a lesson in which he ought to have kept himself out of this bizzarro world and stuck to his simpler life. Both of these scenes seem longer than usual for thrillers. But there's no criticism for this, only praise. Director David Lynch knows exactly how long to extend each scene and the impact really pays off.<br/><br/>Jeffrey's character easily recalls that of James Stewart in "Rear Window". It can sometimes be easy to despise him for sticking his nose where it ought not to be for his own sake. But like "Rear Window", the audience is equally curious to know what is happening even though most of us would never try such things in real life. (Both protagonists also had love interests helping them in their adventures played by Grace Kelly in "Rear Window" and Laura Dern in "Blue Velvet".)<br/><br/>Lynch is also adept in contrasting the "innocent" town life versus its nearby seedy, dangerous underworld. While he succeeds mostly, a few scenes near the end are too unbelievable even for a twisted story like this one. But aided by a great musical score by Angelo Badalamenti, "Blue Velvet" remains one of the best thrillers ever. It pushed the envelope in its day and it still feels like it's doing so more than three decades later. Many later copycats duplicated the violence and perversity of "Blue Velvet" but without a great mind like Lynch's. Their projects just ended up as trash.<br/><br/>Great acting is another highlight of the film. The highlights: as a woman of contradictions, Rossellini is fully believable whether she is aggressively defending her territory or acting out harmful sexual desires. And Hopper is perfect as the ultimately scary psychopath.<br/><br/>Everything you've heard about "Blue Velvet" is true: it is bizarre; it is twisted; it is perverse; and it is brilliant.<br/><br/>RATING: 9 out of 10<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:<br/><br/>1) Directing by David Lynch<br/><br/>2) Acting by Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper (both supporting performances) An erotic playground for how human curiosity can meet the evil fact of its demolition. The movie contain the weirdness which we can understand. I love the happy ending. This is the only movie I ever went to see that I almost walked out of - several times in the first half hour. But it was also so weirdly compelling, that I did not. At the end, it was enjoyable, but I cannot say I want to see it again. Everything you've heard about BLUE VELVET is true. It's different, it's weird, it's wild. And it's one heck of a ride! David Lynch really outdid himself with this one. I promise it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and nothing you'll see after.<br/><br/>The directing and acting are perfect. The story is great, and the tone that Lynch sets throughout the film is spot-on. I don't know how he comes up with this stuff. It's so very different and magical. Highly recommend. This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.<br/><br/>This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: "Frank Booth," played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, "Dorothy Vallens," played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy late-teen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.<br/><br/>In a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them - and there are a number - is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lip-synching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the f-word in about every sentence. He is so over-the-top, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts.<br/><br/>Visually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects).<br/><br/>From discussions I've had, this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much "nicer" films such as "The Straight Story," crazier films ("Wild At Heart," "Eraserhead") and classier movies ("The Elephant Man") but this will be his trademark film: the one above others he will be remembered for, good or bad. Got to the gas mask bit and couldn't watch. Actually came back to it three times before being able to watch it all the way through.<br/><br/>This film is just utterly undefinable and at the same time a teenage detective story. Classic David Lynch. Love the guy This movie is beautiful. Everyone in it is so twistedly beautiful, even Dennis Hopper; who is playing the sickest character of all in the film. It's definitely not for everyone, I could see why some people have refused to finish watching it or ever watch it again. However if you're a fan of strange and dark tales (I'm talking about beyond the Tim Burton whimsical strange) then you'll love/appreciate this film. I was already a fan of "Twin Peaks" prior to watching this film, so I sort of had an idea of what this movie would be like just never imagined the higher level of twisted that David Lynch reaches for. I loved the performances given by the cast, Isabella Rossellini is so tragically gorgeous and Dennis Hopper is so tragically insane, it's just a sick masterpiece. There are familiar faces from
"Twin Peaks" in this film, like Kyle MacLachlan and Jack Nance. MachLachan plays a character that anticipates his Dale Cooper in "Twin Peaks", a young man who's decetive like curiousity leads him to being involved in a very dangerous situation. If you're like me and have a crush on MacLachlan's character in "Twin Peaks", you'll love him just as much in this film. I love the music that Lynch selected, such as the title number and Roy Orbison's "In Dreams"; both sweet oldies that Lynch has managed to make unsettling and dark in a way that, really, only he could. I honestly can't hear "In Dreams" the same way anymore thanks to this film, I'll always be picturing the bloody scene that accompanies this song or Dennis Hopper yelling "candy colored clown, candy colored clown!" If you let the film take you on it's wild ride, you won't be disappointed. It's one of those films that haunts you for the rest of your days, if you love it, you're left wondering "wtf" and trying to piece together what you just saw - in true David Lynch fashion. Now I couldn't give the film the full 10 stars cos the ending disappointed me. I know giving it a happy ending is probably to further fuel the unsettling effect the film has, but it just seemed to out of place for me. Of course it's not all dandy since the characters are in awe over a robin eating a gross looking bug, but I just think it could've ended on a super dark note. Also I wanted Kyle MacLachlan's character to end up with Isabella Rosalini's character not Laura Dern's goofy character; second time David Lynch has the handsome Kyle Machlachlan fail me when it comes to his onscreen love life. STILL, I love David Lynch and I love this film. It is definitely on my top 10 list of films for sure and no matter who you are, you need to make it a point to see this film. Let it perfectly disrupt and pervert your world in all the right ways. From the twisted mind of David Lynch comes BLUE VELVET, a movie that was immediately controversial on release in 1986 with many critics (including Roger Ebert) calling it nothing more than a sick joke intended to shock and disturb, with an excess of gore, foul language and sexual violence. Over time, however, Blue Velvet has come to be remembered as one of the greatest movies of the 1980s and a nightmarish classic from the renowned director. Blue Velvet is a dark psychosexual horror movie about a teenage voyeur who finds himself drawn into an underbelly of crime, drugs and sex in his small town. As with Lynch movie, the true meaning of the film is up to each individual audience member to decide, but we can all agree this movie is beautifully directed, acted and composed, and is a stylish trip into the the depths of the human subconscious. After guy finds an ear on ground, he goes in self investigation that will lead to many strange things. Movie has a totally different approach on filming and showing the scenes that are sometimes very nicely shot. Jeffrey's character is only thing that is worth paying attention throughout movie because he is driven by curiosity and love but also mystery from unknown which led him in many difficult situations. Then movie felt a little off from whole mystery buildup that want's always delivering it to absolutely crazy and sick scenes that are have no other explanation then being psychopathic. Movie doesn't allow too much for audience to try to pick up details and those that are being shown to us are easily read. Then it had some tense moments from Jeffrey's wanders that led to finally revelation of everything. At times movie felt like romantic drama more then mystery with elements of horror and it totally diverted whole plot in times. Also there is some cleverness in Frank's character but as he is obviously crazy it had no reference that could keep him so interesting that we would care. Dorothy is women whose family was taken by Frank and others and she is seeming disturbed and crazy but that could be affected by her torture and pain but also knowledge of where her family is and not being able to help them. 3/4 Blue Velvet is a strange film, just like the films of David Lynch used to be, the script is confusing, smarter, it's a movie that you have to have your interpretation, the cast is very good, Isabella Rossellini, Kyle Machlan, Dennis Hopper , Luara Dern and etc, Lynch's direction is as competent as ever, the photography is great, the soundtrack is very good, the pace is good, the film is not tiring, even with some unnecessary dialogues and scenes, and even Blue Velvet is a good movie, has a good cast and a direction, if you like confusing movies, That can leave your head confused, and give up a knot, Blue Velvet is a great request. Note 7.6 Blue Velvet is the first David Lynch film I have ever seen. The film is about a young man who returns to his home town after his father has an accident and gets involved in a murder and starts investigating it with the help of Laura Dern's character. The characters in the movie seem human enough and the character of Jeffrey is likable, so you do root for him throughout the film.<br/><br/>This is a very well shot movie, most scenes look very crisp and Lynch did a good job at using colors and lighting to create both this jolly, perfect world and also this dark world, it seems even lifeless at times. Blue Velvet is really a crime thriller surrounded by surreal imagery and messages that Lynch uses to tell this conventional story, yet told in a very unusual way. And the main problem I have with this movie is that it's not always clear what Lynch is trying to say. I'm sure he did his best at doing a satire on the "PERFECT LIFE" in the suburbs, but it the hidden messages and things he tries to say get out of hand a lot of the times and the audience can easily get lost in the way.<br/><br/>By far the best part about the film is Dennis Hopper as the main antagonist of the film and him pretty much losing it throughout the film. Quotable as hell.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed Blue Velvet, and it didn't really disappoint me but it gets slow at times and it really doesn't help that it's not always clear what the filmmakers are trying to convey. The whole Star Wars saga was about the conflict between the light and the dark. The story arc of Darth Vader is the one that completely underlines this. He was a Jedi when he started out as Annakin Skywalker, but circumstances led him to get seduced by the dark side of the force and become the evil Darth Vader. The Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil' is another example of a piece of work exploring the aforementioned theme. The message that gets conveyed in the song is that the goodness of God and the evil of the Devil co-exists in all of us. We are the ones who allow ourselves to get seduced by the dark side in us and blame it on the Devil. I think 'Blue Velvet' is David Lynch's treatment and exploration of this concept of duality.<br/><br/>On the surface, 'Blue Velvet' is a noir thriller. But it's the symbolism that enriches the film. It starts with a montage where we see an ideal,charming American neighbourhood with beautiful surroundings and likable people. But then towards the end of the scene the camera suddenly starts zooming in and it goes deep within the grass in the garden and we witness hideous bugs and insects. With this montage, Lynch pretty much sums up the thematic content of the film without having a single line of dialogue. The opening sequence with the ideal American neighbourhood and the lovely people signifying the American Dream hides the dark and disgusting underbelly of the society and this sequence is also an allegory for an individual himself, where he might be a well behaved and gregarious individual on the surface, but he can easily have dark thoughts and ideas at the core of his psyche which he keeps hidden by his own will, but circumstances can easily lead him to fall prey to them.<br/><br/>Jeffrey comes back from college to look after his family after his father suffers a stroke. He finds a mysterious human ear. His friend, Sandy, tells him that the case might have something to do with a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens who lives in a building on Lincoln Street. Now Lincoln street in the film divides the good neighbourhood from the seedy underbelly. The scene where he sneaks into Dorothy's apartment while she is out, gradually proceeds into something more and more creepy and with Dennis Hopper i.e. Frank's entry, it becomes flat out disturbing.<br/><br/>David Lynch filled this film with endless symbolism underlining the concept of duality. Detective Williams with the yellow man shows the duality in the police force. One being honest, and the other being corrupted. Sandy and Dorothy are complete opposites too. Jeffrey spends equal amount of time with both Sandy and Dorothy in the film. Sandy has blonde hair and wears very light coloured dresses, while Dorothy wears dark colours and is a brunette. Jeffrey's relationship with Sandy is based on cute infatuation while his relationship with Dorothy is based on his dark desires and this is underlined when he finally gives in and starts hitting her just like Frank did. Jeffrey continued to justify his pursuance of this situation by convincing Sandy and himself(in a way) that he was doing it because of the mystery, but I think he was keeping contact with Dorothy mainly because it was pleasing him on a darker level to have a creepy, uninhibited and a disturbingly sexual relationship with Dorothy. Similarities can be drawn between Frank and Jeffrey by comparing how they both exploit Dorothy.<br/><br/>Frank can be called the extreme and wild version of Jeffrey as throughout the film with Jeffrey's interactions with Dorothy, we do notice certain similarities between his psychology and Frank's.<br/><br/>'Blue Velvet' has all the idiosyncrasies that you would expect a David Lynch film to have but it does get a bit too disturbing at times. There is a lot of the renowned Lynchian surrealism through dream sequences and other peculiar shots. The shot of the camera zooming in and entering the ear hole of the detached ear which Jeffrey finds is a quintessential David Lynch shot. Similar scenes can be found in 'Eraserhead' and 'The Elephant Man'. This shot symbolises that the ear actually makes Jeffrey enter a whole new world with which he was not familiar. Towards the end of the film, we see a complementary shot of the camera zooming out of the ear hole, showing that Jeffrey managed to make his way out of the darkness. <br/><br/>There are a few problems that I have with the screenplay. There are some scenes in 'Blue Velvet', that I just couldn't make head or tails of. They went over my head and even after thinking long and hard, I just couldn't justify their inclusion in the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful. Blue is the central colour used to signify secrets in the film. When Dorothy sings in the nightclub, the whole stage gets illuminated with this smoky,dreamy blue light signifying the secrets that Dorothy is hiding while putting on this performance in front of the general public. We see her wearing the titular blue velvet robe while she gets forced to be engaged in depraved and disturbing sexual abuse in the hands of Frank. She wears the blue velvet robe while she has sexual relations with Jeffrey too which gradually becomes similar to the relationship between her and Frank. When Sandy gets to know about the nature of Jeffrey's relationship with Dorothy, we see her without any clothes, completely naked. This is because Jeffery's darker side no longer remains a secret to Sandy, so Jeffrey's dark desires are no longer hidden behind the blue velvet. <br/><br/>I don't think 'Blue Velvet' is my favourite David Lynch. That spot is still held by 'Eraserhead'. I have a few problems with the screenplay. But it is still a must watch for all David Lynch admirers. This was a good film, sexy, violent, and disturbing, especially for its time, before the days of torture porn cinema. But it does have its faults. It seems to be over-directed, some of the images obtrusive in their vividness. But I understand that this is David Lynch's style. (He seems to have run his course as a feature film director) Dennis Hopper plays his role as a violent, hyperactive menace, and I might say that he overplays it. A lot. I suppose the amyl nitrate huffing is supposed to explain some of that. But I am sure that this is also what Lynch wanted from him. And there is insufficient character development, or at least exposition, to explain why Jeffery Beaumont is such a risk-taker at the beginning of the film. Isabella Rossellini was great, and lovely to boot. Unnervingly surreal, awfully violent and cruelly misogynistic, this is a film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth and a lingering air of disturbance. Still, it's thesis of unmasking the suburban facade to reveal a sadistic underworld is brilliant, and it's a cerebral experience. Not for the faint of heart or those with a short attention span, but it's worth it for the bizarro direction, great performances, (largely Hoffman), and sheer originality. A unique, utterly scarring film that, for all it's cruel showcases, still deserves a watch and a critical dissection.<br/><br/>This is a film that overall, is more of a mathematic execution of a certain perspective than a piece of entertainment, (Lynch's directorial eye here purposefully executes each shot with ultimate precision, leaving a feeling of disconnect). The opaque nature of the script does make it occasionally hard to believe, and the running time feels a bit long, but all in all, this is a wholly original work that is among Lynch's best and a must for all fans of cinema. I've heard a lot about David Lynch so I finally watched one of his film's and I must say that the 1986 cult classic "Blue Velvet", for it's time was a real classic. The film has it all small town America and it's filled with secrets, sex, lust, betrayal, and drugs and violence. No one is really who they seem to be. It begins when a mild mannered man Jeffrey Beaumont(Kyle MacLachlan)returns home to work at his family's local owned hardware store and he has to help his mother once his father falls ill due to a fatal stroke. And it begins with a twist a human ear is found in a local nearby field. Upon Jeffrey's finding of the ear he reports it to the police and he strikes up a friendship or a kind of boyfriend girlfriend thing with the head policeman's daughter and that's Sandy(the wonderful Laura Dern). And they soon begin their own snoop and private eye type of investigation and it centers around that of a local nightclub lounge singer the sexy and erotic Dorothy Vallens(Isabella Rossellini)and this all leads to her apartment. And soon Jeffrey finds that Dorothy is a lady that likes rough passion and these little games lead to an underworld of sex, drugs, kidnapping, violence, and corruption no one is who they seem. The now late Dennis Hoopper is an eye catch as the lead bad guy Frank Booth this guy is just so evil and sadistic! Dennis always played the heavy types so well! Overall "Blue Velvet" is a cult classic a film of passion, dark secrets, and evil ways all tied in with mystery and suspense and yes as David Lynch showed all of this can happen in small town America. I genuinely believe that this film is one of the greatest works of art to ever grace the silver screen. I have know idea why. It is not that I love the acting, the cinematography, or the writing I just love the film. While I appreciate all facets of this film saying that the high quality of the individual aspects are why I think so highly of the movie would be completely disingenuous. Honestly the fact that I love the way David Lynch shoots a film has almost no bearing on why I feel that Blue Velvet is one of the greatest ever made. If I were to really dig deep and try to find the root of my feelings I would probably find the reason I think this motion picture is great is because it makes me feel like I should. If that makes any sense. Over three decades, David Lynch has managed to carve out a reputation as a "cult" film director and this film is a perfect example. What fascinates me most about "Blue Velvet" other than its film director? Let's begin with its thrilling start. I admire his courage and creativity for visualizing the dark tone of the mystery right from the start. An opening of fear that drives the viewers into an outrageous and ghostly thriller, the nightmare of the realities that are hidden beneath the surface of everyday life. I love how the film starts, an overview of a city that wakes up in the morning. Those exciting and friendly people who greet us, the sweepers, the children getting ready for school, and the old man walking his dog. As we all savor the friendly neighborhood, suddenly the camera focuses to the ground, gets into the grass revealing an object full of insects around, a human ear in a state of decomposition. In my opinion, very few movies say so much of themselves and reveal what will happen right from the start in a very captivating and fascinating way, another masterpiece from David Lynch. As always, Lynch directed "Blue Velvet" in a surrealist manner, dreamlike. This amazing and visually eerie beginning is one of the best in the history of cinema, and serves as a metaphor of appearances of the above friendly society, contrasting it with the hidden underworld of perversion, violence, drugs, sadomasochism and also moral depravity. This provocative, daring, grotesque and romantic film is enriched with the fabulous casts such as Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern, the charming Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper and also Dean Stockwell are just indescribably perfect. Lynch took us into a voyeuristic journey through the unique story of the protagonist, driven by his instinctive curiosity to investigate the mystery that is hidden inside the home of a glamorous nightclub singer. I love how all the sensuality, the pleasure gradually reveal a hidden reality made of violated intimacy, sensuality, of sadism and violence. With the original script written by Lynch himself, produced by Fred Caruso for De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, "Blue Velvet" is a unique and sensational film for it is able to capture and captivate the viewer and drag it to a world that will be difficult to forget: What are also wonderful and unforgettable are the two songs that acclimate and accompany this gem of cinema: "Blue Velvet" sung by Rossellini, and "In My Dreams", by Dean Stockwell. No doubt that this fourth feature film is definitely disturbing as well as beautiful. When David Lynch made this movie, he still had it. "Blue Velvet" is so quirky, in that unique "Lynch" style, perfectly blending dark mystery with romance, irony and humor (a twisted sense of humor I might add). It is moving, scary and funny all together, it's pure Lynch: familiar but dark Americana, white picket fences, light and darkness, innocence and insanity, the mysteries of life and death. <br/><br/>Everything is top-notch here - the outstanding sound design, the writing, the acting (Why hasn't Dennis Hopper won an Oscar for this one?). I found Hopper's character to be very funny. He never crosses the line to being a caricature, but he isn't all that frightening either. All the scenes he's in are priceless, and he's totally unpredictable. It's a strange world, indeed. Jeffrey (MacLachlan) is called back to his old neighborhood following a family medical emergency. Lumberton is a sleepy, bucolic place filled with white picket fences, flower gardens and smiling firemen. While the town looks like something out of an episode of Leave it to Beaver or a republican's wet dream, not everything is as it is initially appears in Lumberton.<br/><br/>While walking near a field, Jeffrey decides to toss a few rocks at and empty glass soda bottle. This small act of mischievousness is the first step in the unravelling of the beautiful facade that envelops Lumberton. For rocks are not all that Jeffrey discovers in this field. A severed human ear covered with ants is strewn amongst the grass and rocks. Yes you heard me right a severed human ear. Is that green mold? ewwww!<br/><br/>To read our full review head over to 3guys1movie.com "Blue Velvet" opens with images from the American Dream: perfect little houses with white picket fences, and impeccably manicured yards. A man collapses while watering his lawn, and the camera, after following him to the ground, parts some blades of grass, and burrows into the ground to reveal a colony of swarming bugs. The message is clear. These themes, and others about the pernicious influence of evil, are explored in appreciable depth throughout "Blue Velvet."<br/><br/>Returning home to visit his father who is in intensive care at the hospital, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), stumbles upon a human ear he finds in a field. With local police detective Williams showing little interest to investigate, Jeffrey and Sandy (Laura Dern), Detective Williams's daughter, decide to do their own investigation. But what Jeffrey and Sandy's investigation leads them to discover that a dark underworld exists in their hometown. Jeffrey becomes suspicious of nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who is involved with Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), an unstable violent man. Dennis Hopper delivers a fantastic and genuinely disturbing performance. <br/><br/>There is a dark obsessiveness to "Blue Velvet" - one that lingers long after the details of the film's mundane drug and kidnapping plot fade away. One is absorbed in the way that David Lynch draws Ivy League college kid Kyle MacLachlan down into a web of voyeurism, rape, sadomasochism, and erotic tension. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect about "Blue Velvet" is how it literally becomes a journey into darkness - and how as Kyle MacLachlan becomes drawn into the web. <br/><br/>A truly eccentric and unsettling observation of the underlying aspects behind the facade of any town, USA. The film possesses an ominous, erotic nuance that disturbs, which has come to define Lynch's critically acclaimed work over the years. Vulgar, disgusting, demented, lurid, shameful, vile, profane, disturbing, unsettling, off-beat, nauseating, and beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable, but overrated, movie that cannot be denied its attempt at being something different. It has a low-key delivery of high-energy smut. The film elicits emotional responses and is quirky enough to engage but not enjoy.<br/><br/>It is all this that makes this controversial cinema. Like Bunuel slicing the eyeball with a straight razor (1929) this is gripping, artsy stuff and not for sensitive types. It is in your face with its audacious set pieces and uses music and soft light to massage the message and make it all seem palatable. <br/><br/>It does not digest easily on an intellectual or artistic level. It mirrors its own excesses with extremes of perversion that denies any willful entrance to the underworld that is so attractive in crime fiction. it makes the viewer feel guilty for trying and that denies any insightful inclusions in the world that is always there, just under the surface with its attractive but destructive vices. By writing and directing Blue Velvet David Lynch was able to create a genuine thriller, overflowing with emotional and sexual tension and deeply disturbing images. Through its story the movie shows that in a seemingly peaceful and simple-minded community there can often be a different world, hiding beneath the surface – a violent and mysterious society that is able to terrorize the city with its sinful wrongdoings. <br/><br/>In Lumberton, a small town, where ordinary people talk in clichés straight out of TV sitcoms, everything seems to be in exact order, up until a young college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) comes back to visit his hospitalized father. On his first day back he discovers a severed human ear somewhere on the ground. When the police investigation isn't sufficient enough for his taste, Jeffrey, with the help of a pretty neighborhood girl Sandy (Laura Dern), decides to search for clues and stumbles onto a dangerous drug-dealing gang of perverts, loosely connected to a woman named Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini), who lives in a filthy apartment downtown. In a typically Hitchcockian scene, Jeffrey observes (standing in the closet) a very disturbing scene of masochistic sexual play, involving Dorothy and a sick, drug-inhaling stranger Frank (Dennis Hopper). He finds out that the woman is forced to be a sex slave for Frank, as he kidnapped her husband and son for the sake of sheer pleasure. Jeffrey goes on a thrilling and life-changing ride (both literally and figuratively) in order to solve the case.<br/><br/>The film is showed on two totally opposing levels of reality. That, perhaps, is the main reason why it becomes less appealing. On one hand, we have the corny and ironic look on the townsfolk, and on the other we have the dark, violent and cold-blooded sequences of sexual depravity, perversion and brutality. The sudden changes only downgrade the powerful tension coming out of the screen and somehow convince the viewer that Lynch wasn't perfectly sure what he wanted to show and what he wanted to omit. If the movie had been kept in the same, perversely expressive mood, it would surely be received as one of the best erotic thrillers in the history. But the divergence between the two portrayed realms at times reminds of a person, who suddenly stops telling a scary story and blasts all the suspense away.<br/><br/>Rossellini gives a fantastic performance, showing how courageous and persuasive she can be in a role. Through a series of sexual tortures Dorothy realizes that she actually is a masochist, and takes great pleasure in passionate and brutal lovemaking. Dennis Hopper is very scary and truly loathsome as a sick man, who can go from one emotional state to the other in a few seconds. MacLachlan is convincing, as 'neighbor' and a guy, who wants to uncover an intrigue all by himself no matter what consequences there might be, and in the process is involved in two affairs, one complex and weighty, second childish and ironically simple.<br/><br/>All in all, Blue Velvet has its purpose and in the final evaluation comes as a deeply perturbing, and even confounding, movie, showing a sad and perfectly realistic story about criminal undergrounds that are able to hide somewhere in the seemingly quiet American communities. With some of the very memorable scenes, it is still a considerable film and one of the finest pieces of work by David Lynch. David Lynch's Blue Velvet has gone on to be a cult classic, like some of Lynch's other works including Eraserhead and Dune. But here's my question: Is it a cult classic basically because his name is on it? Or because it's just that great of a movie? <br/><br/>Blue Velvet revolves around an innocent man (played none other than Lynch regular, Kyle McGlaughlan, if that's how it's spelled) who becomes caught up in a mystery after finding an ear in a field. Him and an old friend(played sweetly by Laura Dern) pursue this case, and eventually become so caught up in it, it sort of tears them apart.<br/><br/>Isabella Rosselini plays a mysterious woman in which he becomes infatuated with, and Dennis Hopper plays the film's over the top villain, who is so insane, it's actually sort of creepy in it's own Dennis Hopper-an way.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an engaging movie, one that really leaves you uncomfortable in some sequences, and one that holds you in others. I mainly took an interest in this film because of Mulholland Dr., and though this film is most likely more popular, I prefer that one. I was expecting more from it's climax. Sure, the strangeness of both films didn't disappoint, but I was sort of expecting this big twist that didn't happen.<br/><br/>The performances work all around, except Hopper's. I do have respect for the dead, and Hopper was a great actor, and though i'll admit he really got under my skin here, I felt he overdid it, sort of like Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard in the last twenty minutes of Scream. Blue Velvet is good, but could have been better. But it is, without a doubt, a true original.<br/><br/>B+ Blue Velvet is a gem of a film. When it was released in 1986, when Reagan reigned the US as president, the film was considered an American original. There really had not been anything like it before: such a compelling mix of violence, sexuality, suspense and drama. Many people compare it to the work of Hitchcock, with sexual extremes. It's easy to see why. A better way to sum up Blue Velvet would be to say it's like a Norman Rockwell painting, the quintessential American scene: a tight-knit family, a small town, American suburbia plus surrealism not unlike Dali, and of course, Hitchockian suspense. Whether or not director's and artists acknowledge Blue Velvet's influence upon their work, it is clearly there. The film liberated cinema: it gave artists and directors the creative license to push the boundaries in film, even more so than before.<br/><br/>The film itself is wonderful. Many people call it dark, depraved and twisted. It is, but it's also hopeful, re-assuring and beautiful. People who claim it's simply dark and pretentious, need to check they are watching the same film. There are dark elements, but you need to remember that good overcomes evil in Blue Velvet. In the grand tradition of Lynch films, no matter who dark they may be half way through, there is always a happy or hopeful (yet ambiguous) ending. The robins stop singing half-way through Blue Velvet, but they return in the end and peace and happiness is restored. Just like life, usually. There always is a silver lining. Blue Velvet is an incredibly made film: it's well crafted in every aspect, from the performances, the stunning, eye-popping cinematography (oh! those rich reds and blues), the music, the direction. I highly recommend it, some of it's hard to stomach, but the ending and the film itself is so, so rewarding. <br/><br/>A masterpiece. Ignore people here who judge and pan this movie by conventional standards. David Lynch's movies often seem to have a point, but made in a ridiculous or heavy-handed way. Some don't like this. That's fine. But by scrutinizing the plausibility, what they miss is what makes Lynch so...well, different...and interesting. Lynch's uncompromising movies are like cartoons drawn by someone with a different brain chemistry. The colors, the action, the script, the pacing, the direction, the acting, etc. They are exaggerations. And the results are unique.<br/><br/>David Lynch's worlds are silly putty worlds. Fine if you don't like the ride - and I've rolled my eyes at his films more than once. But it is a ride you won't get anywhere else. And while you are on it you will experience some amazing moments and visuals that will stick in your mind in a way few other films offer. Blue Velvet is one of these films. Every so often a film comes around and reminds us that film exists as an art form, not merely as gripping or entertaining storytelling. Like an abstract painting, a film is allowed to be devoid of a singular purpose and instead aim to affect us and withdraw a reaction. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" served as that reminder in 1986, creating a portrait of small-town America that intrigues, haunts us and even makes us chuckle.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" at a narrative level, functions on the principle that we are all intrigued by the darkness in this world, even if we're not ready to handle it. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), is college-aged, returning home after his father is hospitalized. One day he discovers a severed human ear in a field near his home and decides to turn it in to the police. In doing so, he meets a detective's 18-year-old daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern), who tells him how she overheard her father discussing the name of a night club singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) being involved in the case. Tickled by curiosity, Jeffrey enlists Sandy's help to spy on Dorothy, but when Dorothy catches him in her apartment one day, Jeffrey gets personally tangled up in the matter.<br/><br/>Once again, the presumption for this film to work is that these two naive kids let their curiosity get the better of them, perhaps because their lives are devoid of intrigue. The scenes between Jeffrey and Sandy seem to come right out of "Happy Days," or any '50s and '60s- based film. "I can't figure out if you're a detective or a pervert," Sandy asks Jeffrey, which finally addresses the strangeness of the matter at hand, that two otherwise young strangers have formed a relationship based on a shared interest in voyeurism. By the time we would find out Jeffrey's answer (he says "that's for me to know and you to find out"), it's already too late.<br/><br/>Caught in Dororthy's closet, Jeffrey — and subsequently the viewer — are exposed to some frightening horrors, a simultaneous loss of all forms of innocence. When Frank (Dennis Hopper) comes over, inhaling either helium or some other drug through a breathing mask, we're introduced to one of film's most dark and disturbing characters. Frank beats Dorothy and rapes her in a bizarre manner as she wears a blue velvet gown. The significance of the blue velvet comes from the classic Bobby Vinton song that Dorothy sings at her club and Frank is quite fond of it. Turns out that Frank has some kind of control over Dorothy and Jeffrey plans to discover why. But when Dorothy seduces him, it complicates matters.<br/><br/>Hopper delivers a truly frightening performance, made all the more effective because Lynch puts us squarely in Jeffrey's shoes. He seems to understand exactly how we would feel caught on the other side of the fence, and MacLachlan exudes that innocence and naive determination to confront evil.<br/><br/>It seems grossly amateur to call a David Lynch film a story of "good and evil," but "Blue Velvet" does not present archetypes of those concepts with exception of Frank embodying nothing good. His film provides a visceral, brain-jarring punch using excellent scene composition and overt symbolism. Although you'll be dying to know why Lynch has done these many unsightly things to get this reaction out of you, patience is key. Eventually we are left with nothing but our own reaction to interpret, which all high art should succeed at doing. Like many of Lynch's other films, I would expect a more enjoyable second viewing, knowing now that the events of the film are secondary to how they're supposed to make you feel.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com "Blue velvet" is probably the movie that is the easiest one to approach by still coming quite close to the typical trademarks of David Lynch's art of directing. It reunites the accessibility of "Dune" and "Wild at heart" with the weird surrealism of "Lost highway" or "Mulholland Drive". This movie is one of the rare ones by David Lynch that is possible to be understood with the first try even though there are some mysterious and uncovered hints and elements throughout this interesting flick.<br/><br/>This movie gives us already a glimpse at what we could later on expect from David Lynch as the movie is settled in a small town where many strange people live beneath the surface of peaceful boredom just like in "Twin Peaks". The movie has almost the approach of a thriller and gets quite fast interesting in comparison to the rather slow paced approaches of most of David Lynch's movies. This movie isn't as intense, surreal and surprising as many of his other works are, but it is filled with tension and dominated by a strong acting by Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan and especially the legendary Dennis Hopper. The charismatic acting of those three cornerstones of the movie makes this flick work and makes me pardon the fact that the movie is not as imaginary as one should expect from such a great director. Some secondary actors like Laura Dern or Jack Nance also do a great job as usual.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this is a rather weak movie considering the other works of David Lynch and a little bit too general and mainstream orientated but it is nevertheless an entertaining psycho thriller with some stunning acting. I would recommend this movie to any fan of psycho thrillers without any hesitation. But I wouldn't recommend this movie to someone who would like to enter the universe of David Lynch as there are surely better choices such as "Mulholland Drive". The discovery of a human ear in the woods leads to a mystery involving some weird and unsavory characters. This is an interesting mood piece by Lynch that unfolds at a leisurely pace. It is more coherent than some of the director's later films, but it feels like a good idea not fully explored. After an intriguing premise is established, the plot seems to become a secondary concern, with the primary focus being quirkiness. When it comes to playing weirdos, few actors are as well suited as Hopper and Stockwell, but it is new territory for Rossellini. She turns in an interesting performance, although it probably had Ingrid Bergman turning over in her grave. This is one of those films that punches you, that sticks a knife in your gut and twists it around a bit, a movie that can make you feel absolutely awful. It's scary, it's sickening, it's violent, but it's also beautiful. Kyle MacLachlan plays a college student returning to his hometown, a relative innocent who approaches the film as we do; an outsider. He's not the type of grizzled noir antihero who comes prepared for the sort of things he finds. No, he's pretty green, but he's not stupid. And he finds the strength within himself to overcome the horrific things that surround him. On the flipside is Dennis Hopper's character, a man who's well connected in the town, who knows exactly what he's doing, but despite all this is a slave to his own dark impulses. This film is about the dark side of human nature, about rape and murder and every horrific thing you can think of. But it's also about the underlying strength of the ordinary man, about all those redemptive qualities that make this world a tolerable place to live in. Going into this film is like descending into hell, and never before has my mental state been so dependent on a movie's outcome. David Lynch has since gotten more experimental in his approach, but his films still get me like no other director's can. This movie is in my opinion his first true masterpiece. Take note. David Lynch's Blue Velvet is a surreal and atmospheric motion picture. It has a sense of dread and mystery throughout that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. This is my 2nd Lynch film, after Mulholland Drive (which I consider the best film of it's decade), and it certainly has the same tone and style that Mulholland Dr. had. The film remains just as unpredictable as a film can get just because you wonder where Lynch is taking you. Saying that, it is actually more understandable that I would have thought. The real beauty lies in the journey and how the film leaves you in awe after it is over. <br/><br/>The acting is strong, especially Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini. Both are superb and are the characters that drive the film. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern give the film the heart that is needed. The direction is masterful. Like I said before, you realize that this is a Lynch film because he leaves his trademark on his films. He is a very talented and capable director, and his direction is what gives the film it's surrealism and atmosphere. One can only guess that the reason he is able to do that is because he writes his own screenplays and he is able to visualize what he wants in his film and how he wants it done. <br/><br/>All in all, this is an unpredictable and dark film, one that is very easy to admire and get lost within. Even though I do not think it is quite as great as Mulholland Drive, it remains a competent and strong film that only does justice to his resume. "Blue Velvet" is one of the most intense flicks from our generation. Director David Lynch takes the pathetically naive and innocent and blends it with the completely demented and bizarre to create, in my opinion, the ultimate in modern-day film noir. Check this out: Frank Booth (Hopper) is a demented, drug-dealing, gender-confused kidnapper (with an oedipus complex) that has good connections. He takes Rosselini's husband and son and kidnaps them in exchange for perverse sexual favours. His bizarro posse includes Jack Nance (R.I.P.) as Bob, and Dean Stockwell as the ultra-suave Ben. MacLachlan is the curious & naive "young adult" that becomes curious on what gives when he finds an ear in the grass (sounds strange?). He manages to hook up with the investigating cop's daughter (Laura Dern) and begins a psychological menage a trois balancing good & evil! <br/><br/>Lynch peaked with this film. The film is an absolute masterpiece, and it is filled with many beautifully filmed scenes. Everyone who has a taste for the strange should own this, and anyone who wants to appreciate true visionary film-making see it! This is an excellent movie. It is also one of Lynch's most linear films, that doesn't make it simple, however. This film is just plain amazing. Dennis Hopper's performance as Frank Booth is wonderful, along with Isabella Rossellini and Kyle MacLachlan who also star in this sick, twisted story viewed through the artistic eye of director, David Lynch...the story progresses into one of the strangest endings ever on film. As a portrait of madness, it ranks above something like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for its principal madman is far more mundane and far less easy to understand than any clinically-described serial killer. David Lynch proved, with this film, that he is one of the world's best movie makers. Frank Booth is probably the greatest and coolest "bad guy" in any crime-drama film. Definitely worth your time. This film is a modern noir-drama by David Lynch which deals with the evil things happening underneath the surface of a seemingly perfect world of the 50's. It involves a college guy who discovers a dismembered ear in a field and is curious about it so he gives it to the police and begins his own investigation. What he finds out is that evil can be contagious if you're not careful and it can suck you into its destructive path. On a technical note, the film has a very rich color and often uses the color in the title. <br/><br/>David Lynch also tampers with the sound in this and creates some haunting moments with it. As far as soundtracks go, this one takes the cake and will probably confuse some viewers as to it's immediate significance. Important to note. Tis a Lynch film and it is morbid in some places that I will not go into explaining. So if you're into straightahead films, this is not it. Some of his elements come from left field. Let me put it this way, this is a mainstream film that goes so far into left field that it almost fits the art house category. In fact, it is an art house flick. Knowing this, proceed carefully unless you are already a fan of Lynch(like I am). Very Challenging Film One of the most striking and beautifully crafted movies I've seen in a long long time. Some of the camera angles and shadow/light stuff is really cool. The story is disturbing but realistic and I really cared for the characters. Lynch has superbly created a masterpiece. I loved the balance of slow-motion and blurred facial trails - something Lynch used in Elephant Man and Lost Highway. I totally bought into the surreal world of Frank and his friends. Unforgettable movie well worth watching a few times to catch some of the nuances and subtle peripheral visual noises.<br/><br/>Granted, Blue Velvet is a disturbing movie. Do not even attempt to RENT this film if you can't deal with the most disturbing absurdities and evil people you have ever seen on film. Dennis Hopper creates a villain of unparalleled sadism - unparalleled except by Dean Stockwell, a man whom Hopper looks up to and who lip syncs to Roy Orbison's "Candy Colored Clown." Even the Isabella Rossellini is a disturbing portrait. Good grief! Even some of the "normal" folks are disturbing. But apart from that, Blue Velvet is a beautifully crafted thriller and one of the best I have ever seen. On any level, David Lynch's Blue Velvet is a completely unique act of cinema: an 80s Hollywood studio film as radical, visionary and disturbing as an anything found in avant-garde obscure cult cinema. It is an American art film by one of the country's only decent art director's. And today, it is regarded as visionary classic, and it truly is. The film is horrifying and equally beautiful. It is a compelling journey into the darkest depths of the human soul. It deals with the dark side of everyone, demonstrated by Jeffrey, who dances a little too close to the fire after discovering his hometown's dark-side. Blue Velvet is a slice of life seen through the bloodshot eyes of lust and desire. Detractors of Blue Velvet claim the film is merely a sex thriller with no meaning, the film is anything but that! It is about the inescapable and tragic confrontation of the innocent from the sufferings and inappropriate depravity of adulthood.<br/><br/>A remarkable masterpiece. Highly recommended! For many people, Blue Velvet is David Lynch's masterpiece. Driven by lush visuals, an astonishing performance by the unforgettable Dennis Hopper as one of cinema's most memorable psychotics, the film managed to sneak in art house, surrealist techniques into what appears to be a big Hollywood stylized thriller that is a throwback to the noirs of the 1940s and 50s. The film crystallizes many of Lynch's chief preoccupations: the evil that lurks under a seemingly pristine surface of banal American suburbia. While two of his major films dealing with the corruption underneath glitzy idealism (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway) take place in a sprawling, endless metropolis of Los Angeles, Blue Velvet actually takes place in a relatively low populated sleepy suburban setting - small town America. Before 1986, Hollywood cinema was playing it relatively low, and safe. Blue Velvet became a major alternative - not only did it push MANY boundaries, it proved to be a mainstream success rather than remaining a obscure cult indie flick, what it could have been.<br/><br/>Is it all that good? Blue Velvet is richly textured and all too effective. It's an above average thriller, and definitely one of the greatest American films of the 1980s, perhaps THE greatest. It does have it's drawbacks, the dialog isn't anything suburb and it does suffer badly in regards to Laura Dern's acting. However, it is not dated nor is it any less fresh than it was some 25 years ago. It's unmissable in terms of sheer brilliance on David Lynch's behalf, this is certainly his most outstanding achievement, especially when I am not a major Lynch fan. It isn't going to grab everyone's interest and please every single viewer like a typical classic, but it certainly is unmissable. "Blue Velvet" changed everything. It is fair to say that it's impact can be felt in almost every motion picture or TV series that followed. Not only was it a critical success but it was also a commercial success, ESPECIALLY for a film that deals with bizarre sexual perversion and violence, and not in a low-key manner, the violence and depravity in this film is very in your face. If its blend of sexual perversions and complete offbeat weirdness hadn't been so successful, Lynch's cult phenomenon Twin Peaks TV series would never have even reached the pilot stage. And without Twin Peaks, there'd be no X-Files, no American Gothic, and quite possibly no Buffy the Vampire Slayer either. Without Blue Velvet, there would be no American Beauty, no Desperate Housewives, and there would very few films to explore human sexuality.<br/><br/>But is the film really worth it's hype. Well, yes and no. A lot of people were declaring the film a masterpiece, and an American classic, even weeks after it was released in 1986. It isn't hard to see why, the film is an exhilarating roller coaster. Even though you remain in your seat the entire viewing, you sweat to the bone at the pure adrenaline rush it feeds you. But looking beyond that, the film is quite simple. It is simply a slice of small town Americana gone awry. The performances are not remarkable, with the exception of Dennis Hopper. He possesses some kind of terrifying magic that no villain in cinema has demonstrated ever since. Kyle MacLachlan is a fine actor, and his capabilities are very obvious in Blue Velvet. The man can act. Isabella Rossellini is a stand-out, playing the broken, mentally fragile mother who's sanity is literally hanging by a thread. Laura Dern, has, well, gotten better a lot better since here. <br/><br/>The plot, which now is not so original (having being recyled over and over again), still seems fresh here. The visuals are an absolute standout, every color and detail is breathtaking, from the gory, splattered head matter of Frank Booth to Rossellini's blue velvet gown. There are some flaws, the film is a little clichÃ©d, the dialog isn't amazing, but the film is definitely worth seeing it, I really would not miss out on a film like this, despite it not quite fulfilling the reputation it receives, it is an un-missable film. Blue Velvet, the ultra weird, ultra kinky cult classic, was David Lynch's comeback vehicle from the "Dune" debacle that almost bankrupted Dino De Laurentis and lost major bucks at the BO. This movie did MUCH better. Why is this so hard to believe? Well, remember those guys you used to see in every size-able town who would ride around in old Chevys or Buicks, six or seven full, bent on raising hell? Well, this story is about one callow young fellow's brush with people like that as he pursues the spoor of a mystery that he himself discovered.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont, played by Kyle MacLachlan, after visiting his ailing father in the hospital, finds a severed ear in a vacant lot and promptly takes it to the chief of police. The chief of police adds to the mystery by telling him to stay out of it and let the police handle the case, so naturally, Jeffrey can't keep away from the whole thing and does his own investigating.<br/><br/>To complicate matters, the daughter of the chief, (a very wooden Laura Dern,) befriends him and gives him leads as to who may be connected to the severed ear...whether it's part of a homicide or some gruesome torture method. While investigating all this, Jeffrey manages to meet the woman the chief's daughter implicated as a possible accessory to the mystery. He does this by hiding in her closet after masquerading as an exterminator and taking her keys earlier in the day. The woman, Dorothy Valens, is played by Isabella Rossellini, NOT playing the kind of part she usually plays, though her basic innocence still comes through in this smarmy role. Anyway, this is how Jeffrey finds out about Frank Booth, perhaps the SICKEST movie villain you've seen since Clarence from "Robocop"! Frank, as it turns out, is connected with the crawling, insidious underworld in little Lumberton, where this all takes place. Jeffrey, late teen jerk that he is, actually FALLS for the Valens character and ends up being her paramour....and....well, it gets REALLY convoluted from here, and to relinquish more might spoil it for you, but suffice it to say, as I mentioned earlier, that about half the cast of "Dune" is in this movie, (MacLachlan, Jack Nance, Brad Dourif and Dean Stockwell,) and, with the exception of MacLachlan, they play pretty grisly villains, just like in Dune.<br/><br/>Foul language reigns in this movie the minute Frank, (Dennis Hopper,) comes into the picture and doesn't stop. Frank's malevolence is palpable, because you KNOW you know somebody like this somewhere, and no matter what, they're STILL unbelievable.<br/><br/>This movie makes "Subway", a movie I recently reviewed, look like Mother Carey's Chickens...David Lynch is one TRULY strange person to have directed this. The air of sadism is unreal, and the view of small town corruption is truly disturbing. We all know there are small towns like this in America, but you STILL have to wonder what motivated him.... It's not actually a great movie, but as a neo-noir it is exceptional, and somewhat memorable. Some parts of Blue Velvet quite successfully recapture that jazzy, late forties/fifties, Hitchcockian tone. At other times, it has heart, something not usually seen in the noir category. sometimes it's just plain wacky, and these are the parts that sort of degrade the film. <br/><br/>One of the differences between original noir and Neo-noir is that the latter often includes more sexual erotica. As is the case with Blue Velvet, this sort of material feels gratuitous, but if anything, it proves that the film is not in any way sissy, or afraid to get its hands a little dirty. Blue Velvet isn't actually all that dirty. In fact, sometimes it feels quite clean, and it ends on a positive note in fact which makes me feel like the story has taken me somewhere, (in contrast to Mullholland Dr. which takes you nowhere)<br/><br/>Occasional error aside, I'd say Blue Velvet is worth at least one watch. In many respects - well, almost every respect - this is a brilliant film. Any good film is impossible to describe. The contrast between the violence and seaminess of Frank's world and the laughable banality of Jeffery's world comes across perfectly. Dennis Hopper's performance as Frank really cannot be praised enough. Sure, he's impressive when he's huffing nitrous oxide and hitting Jeffrey across the face, but his expression while listening to the old lounge songs - melancholy, regretful - is equally convincing, and he's almost sympathetic. Also classic is the moment when another character proposes to toast his health, and he mutters: 'Aw, let's drink to something else.' Jeffrey's Reeve-like blankness is a good foil for him. That said, there's just something - something about the random imagery inserted, like subliminal shots but held for longer, images of a snuffed candle and insects - something about the pacing, the long silences and occasional anticlimax - and something about the surprising semi-happy ending - that doesn't work. I feel like I'm missing something, and maybe I just am, but I don't feel like Lynch accomplished everything he set out to do. Just when it could be frightening, it lapses into comedy. This vagueness may be part of the message - life isn't black-and-white, or clean - but still. The movie is effective, but it doesn't resonate. I adore the way in which Lynch leads you into his own microcosm, each screen is more intriguing than the previous and you become involved with the characters. Blue Velvet is no exception: a simple town boy is intrigued by a woman, and following his curiosity gets drawn into her web, only to inadvertently uncover dark mysteries. We take this genuinely and often weirdly funny walk with him, a walk that'll cling to your thoughts long after the credits have rolled. I don't idolize Lynch as many reviewers do (although I admired his work in The Straight Story) and I believe he has too often pursued weirdness for the sake of weirdness. But at his best he has produced marvels of film making. Blue Velvet is one of the latter as it doozily exposes the hidden dark underbelly of small towns, and of people that are seldom what they seem on the surface. <br/><br/>More than one viewing of this film is definitely necessary if you really want to get it. The first time round, I ended up thinking that this was simply a noir-ish attempt at vulgar violence. The second viewing actually made me see some of the things Lynch wanted us to see without the shock factor. <br/><br/>Even so, this one may not be for everyone, but a must for Lynch fans. 10/10 Anyone that thinks Blue Velvet is a simple no-brains thriller with no depth or meaning has COMPLETELY missed the boat. I have never seen a more layered, meaningful film. David Lynch is without a doubt the most brilliant talent in the movie business and the fact that he doesn't alter his work to please audiences makes him even better. I would compare him to Stanley Kubrick. His movies are always crafted with intelligence, disturbing beauty and bizarre creativity, just like Kubrick's work. "Blue Velvet" is one of the most original, beautiful and fascinating movies I've ever seen. It is dark, funny, and very disturbing. The seemingly perfect town has an eerie sense of similarity to small towns everywhere. The only thing I can compare it to is a a beautiful, but haunting waking dream. It really has stuck in my head, those that don't see anything behind it, please, re-watch it, and think next time. A truly unforgettable masterpiece. An interesting but often shocking and disturbing film about corruption in small town USA. Told with amazing visual poetry, Blue Velvet is really a film that evokes emotion and a strong reaction, whether it is a good or bad one depends entirely on your taste. I had heard of David Lynch although I had only seen one of his films, The Elephant Man, which is not really trademark Lynch, apparently. Nothing prepared me for Blue Velvet, because it is a completely original film. There are, however, flaws. I am not certain if it holds up well over time, the film is very 1980s, and the acting is not exactly top notch with the exception of Dennis Hopper. Although, it is an unforgettably fascinating and foreboding film with a well constructed plot. for those of you who have mentioned that this film has no plot, take your own advice and don't watch films like blue velvet. stick to movies like armaggeddon and let bruce willis spoon feed the plot to you. David lynch follows his own formula that is driven by his unique vision that no straight forward plot could follow. This film deals with a THEME: the evil that dwells beneath the most beautiful of surfaces. The ants in the beginning suggest the rage, tension and evil unrest that exists bebeath a perfectly mowed American green lawn. This can be seen allegorically mirroring the bigger picture of the reality of our world despite what its crust reveals. Therefore many seemingly out of place haunting sequences are put in by lynch as paintstrokes in his cinematic painting that tie into the overall theme. Lynch is a true artist that does not compromise his art for public demands. "Blue Velvet", David Lynch's 1986 cult favorite, is a symbolically rich, horrifyingly beautiful, icy and compelling. Beneath the normal, friendship-oriented world of small town Americana, Lynch delivers a haunting and terrible (but inexplicably fascinating) world of sexual perversion, evil and corruption. The fascinatingly complex relationship between these two realms is unified by a rather simple Hitchock-style mystery-detective plot (somewhat of a throwback to film noir), but, like the opening montage, this ultimately gives way to a premise of greater depth and complexity. Blue Velvet is disguised as a relatively simple sexual thriller and it has fooled some critics and audiences into thinking it is. This is David Lynch and Blue Velvet is anything but simple. Without summarizing plot, one could argue that the central characters in this tableau are representative of each world in some way: Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle Maclachlan), the college student and amateur detective whose seemingly innocent curiosities lead him into the complicated underworld where they evolve into voyeurism and compulsion; Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), the tormented lounge singer whose familial ties to illicit, bizarre affairs have forced and trapped her in this underworld; Sandy Williams (played in a relatively painful manner by a young Laura Dern), Beaumont's budding romantic interest who is willing to help her too-curious friend but remains morally and psychologically rooted in the positive "surface" world; Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), Dorothy's tormentor and blackmailer, and the terrifying, twisted villain who exemplifies the negativity of the underworld. The relations between these characters serve as the foundation for juxtaposing the two worlds, a contrast which is strengthened by the frequent use of symbols and subtleties (e.g. color and lighting, sometimes surreal placement of characters on the screen, the heavy profanity of Frank).<br/><br/>The main underlying idea is certainly a haunting one: behind every facade and every seemingly normal appearance is an existence of a deviant nature. I do not believe that Blue Velvet is a perfect film, though: even though its story is complex and difficult to assemble it often progresses conspicuously slowly and unevenly. The film presents several jarring and somewhat confusing breaks of flow over its 124-minute duration. Several important scenes are depicted in brief shots and, in the spirit of the underworld that the film illustrates, low light. Similarly, many lines are whispered. While some of these effects are essential to the artistic aspirations of the film, it may be difficult for the viewer to perceive all of them. A second viewing is often necessary, but, unless a viewer cannot endure this film, a second viewing is probably inevitable. This is not a film for everyone. It is offbeat, however this is a Lynch. Wonderful, memorable but completely disturbing. The first shot of Blue Velvet epitomizes the content that is elaborated on throughout David Lynch's now classic psycho-sexual drama. We see idealized images of a small town, a well manicured garden, only to dip below the surface to discover swarming insects. This is a metaphor for what the rest of the film explores - what lies beneath and what is seemingly hidden within the inhabitants of this small town, within the town itself. Jeffrey Beaumont, after discovering a human ear, proceeds with his own investigation, along with the help of the wholesome, high-school sweetheart Sandy Williams, whose father is the towns detective. They are introduced to Lumberton's hidden underworld, home to prostitution, illegal drug trade and sexual violence. Not to mention one of the most infamous cinema villains every created - Frank Booth. The film transcends from a tale about what lies beneath, to a tale about good vs. evil, good being Jeffrey, evil being Frank.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a very well done film. It doesn't have the typical David Lynch narrative, where being coherent and making sense is almost non-existent, Blue Velvet actually tells a very straightforward story. It operates like a Hitchock thriller, but there are those bizarre Lynchian elements with surrealism on par with that of the masterful Dali. The lush red lipstick of Dorothy Vallens and the midnight blue on her gown also looks amazing on DVD. The only detractors I have for the film as a whole is its sometimes weak acting from Laura Dern and the occasional over-the-top acting of Dennis Hopper. Also, some of the sexual and violent overtones of the film become a little too heavy at some points, in particular a ridiculously perverted rape scene. But other than that, Blue Velvet is a very well-done film and one of David Lynch's finest. When I first saw this film in 1986 my initial reaction was a very low key "yeah, that's seems about right." As we left the theater I said to my girlfriend "I guess some people are impressed. They seem excited." She answered "I guess they relate to it." I thought about that. It puzzled me. People relate to this movie? Really? The film is one long bizarre hallucinogenic episode. A continuous parade of lurid paranoia and primal terror. Though this was the nature of the scenes I had just witnessed, their sum effect was oddly familiar, normal. The cumulative result of this queer pageant amounted to little more than "Uh huh", a mental shrug in agreement. It didn't strike me as drastic or alien or mysterious, but just felt like everyday life as I seemed to be experiencing it then. At the time I was a struggling art student, perhaps a little stressed, and probably very cocky.<br/><br/>When I see it now I understand perfectly how this eccentric carnival ride of a movie could have first seemed so unremarkable to me. The most important factor in my initial ambivalence was the fact that at the time I was living in Philadelphia. You need to know something about Philly that isn't obvious or advertised or talked about much, and that is that Philadelphia is a peculiar place. Very peculiar. For one, it's got an enormously huge, absurdly gargantuan inferiority complex. It's totally intimidated by both New York City and Washington, D.C. There's nothing good said about either of those cities in Philly that doesn't get immediately followed by a disgusted put-down. Such as "New York has the best pizza!" will get answered with a sarcastic grunt "Yeah, if you like rat on it." See? This psychological condition results in all manner of hostility and paranoia. It's why we snowballed Santa.<br/><br/>Another disturbing quality was specific to the times. There was a garbage strike in the summer of '86. It was a nightmare. The restaurant down stairs piled their trash up in a mountain under our back bedroom window. Summer in Philly is bad enough without the added stench and vermin. In the 80's downtown Philadelphia was still a grubby, dirty, tiny city. It had so many old colonial row homes and converted industrial spaces that were so shabby and puny. Just barely enough space for average sized people, dark shadowy alleys, cramped sidewalks, and all phillthy. And I haven't yet mentioned the murder rate and crack epidemic. It was extreme.<br/><br/>So that's the environment and mindset with which I first saw "Blue Velvet." If the people in the theater thought that what they had seen up on the screen was extreme then they just had to be blind, oblivious out-of-towners. It felt like I lived in that "Blue Velvet" creepiness everyday, so it just didn't register with me as all that unusual.<br/><br/>Despite my overall neutral reaction to the movie I was curious about David Lynch. I checked out what else he had done and in addition to a couple other previous commercial projects - "The Elephant Man" (1980) and "Dune" (1984) which I had already seen and enjoyed but was unawares of its director - I discovered "Eraserhead", his first feature from 1977. It was available on video and we rented it. Nothing could have prepared me for that mind and soul shattering assault. It was twice, no, ten times as disturbing as "Blue Velvet." Here was all that revolting horror that "Blue Velvet" promised but lacked. It's a hideous monster movie disguised as a bizarre love story. It's unlike anything I'd ever seen; raw, crude, real, but completely mysterious. Utterly disturbing.<br/><br/>You might not know that David Lynch had lived in Philadelphia in the late 1960s and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fina Art, the same school that I had attended. I have since read interviews with David and he confirms that his impressions of life in Philly are the source for "Eraserhead's" psychological intensity, deep impressions he carried with him when he relocated to Los Angeles, where he made the film for the next 5 years. So that's what had happened. David had shot most of his lode on "Eraserhead", and had only trace, residual Philly weirdness left by the time he made "Blue Velvet." I'm not now trashing the movie, but putting it in perspective. "Blue Velvet" is very good. It's packed with jarring, haunting imagery, and superbly freakish characters. There's no mistaking it for any other director's work. But it pales in comparison to the originality and intensity of "Eraserhead." And you can easily say the same for all of Lynch's more recent films. He's gotten slicker, cleaner and more sophisticated (except for maybe his web released animations), but nothing's else equals his first for horrendous originality.<br/><br/>P.S. This note dates 4/16/10, after having recently experienced Lynch's "Inland Empire" (2006), which actually towers above all of David's previous works, both in ambition and execution. I did not see IE when it was first released because I stupidly, inexplicably accepted all the early negative reviews and opinions as trustworthy. Big mistake. It's a profound artistic and sociological triumph. It's not merely a "film", or a "movie", but a true psychic experience, a stunning visual and auditory phenomenon, which is what "movies" have been vainly, crassly, inaccurately claiming to be from their beginning. I have a comment for "Inland Empire" here on IMDb, if you care to check it out. Blue Velvet had to earn my respect, even though it was so dark and eerie and enigmatic: the world that writer/director David Lynch created in this movie was so unique and interesting, be it deeply disturbed (I mean, look at the movie poster) that you just have to say 'wow.' I don't think that there are many people in Hollywood that have Lynch's ability or state of mind and I guess that's why I admired this film.<br/><br/>My Introduction to Screen writing professor probably would have labeled the plot of Blue Velvet as "episodic," meaning that random things keep happening to the main characters, instead of things happening or 'growing' out of necessity. I may be inclined to agree with that thought, but in this case, I don't think it's a bad thing. In a way, the main character's random stumbling around town makes sense in regard to the style of this movie; Lynch has made the story flow like a bad dream, almost psychedelically.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I couldn't help but tune in to some of the making-of documentary on my DVD's special features, to try to get a little insight. Somebody in the documentary clip mentioned how Lynch has sort of become America's Luis Bunel, and I can sort of see that. I watched Bunel's Tristana (1970) for a Spanish film class and I remember how it was full of very strange camera shots and symbolic references in his random standoutish tactics (for example, the phallic bell that turned out to be the decapitated head of a lustful father-figure). Anyway, Lynch seems to have locked on to a similar mentality about how to create a strange and gloomy, confusing world by using odd film techniques. In fact, later on in the documentary on Blue Velvet, somebody else mention the term "American Surrealism," which, yeah, makes sense.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper had just finished rehab before making this movie. Apparently, his agent begged him not to play this role because of the probable negative image it would portray of him, and I can see why. Hopper was very scary and a crazy bad guy who did a wonderful (or awful?!) performance. What a creepy part! Isabella Rossini is also a person of interest in this movie because she too is one of the eerie mysterious characters wrapped up in the dark plot. She realistically portrays insanity as well as personified, messed-up sexual desires. We can't help but wonder how her character ended up being so crazy-- was it caused by drugs or getting involved with the wrong people or the trauma inflicted by Hopper's character? Whatever the cause, damn.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the line "It's a strange world" kept on being repeated in different settings by different people. And I think that sums up Lynch's take on our world, at least as he showed it to us in Blue Velvet. He certainly likes to create these weird and crazy people and events, but he never explicitly answers our questions to solve the mystery. I suppose that for a lot of people, this can get on their nerves. His style is definitely not for everyone. But if you're into weird stories and are up for a unique and interesting style, I recommend this movie. It's at the minimum unforgettable. To me most of Lynch's films are like fascinating oil on canvasses. Rich in colour, detailed yet ambiguous, they are more than what one sees on the surface. 'Blue Velvet' is no different. At first glance it looks like a nice neighborhood in the suburbs until Jeffrey finds an ear in the yard after which, through Jeffrey, Lynch peels the layers into something far darker. Unlike, Lynch's other works, he uses a lot of humour. Yes, it is dark and of a macabre sort so perhaps not everybody's cup of tea. The story includes disturbing themes like voyeurism, torture, murder, rape and masochism yet it is visually captivating with its images. The lighting is top quality. Cinematography has always been a strong point of Lynch's films. Here he uses effective closeups and shoots from distinct angles. The songs give 'Blue Velvet' a surreal and nostalgic quality and they are exceptionally visualized. Kyle Machlachlan, Isabella Rosselini, Laura Dern, Dennis Hopper and Dean Stockwell all deliver first rate performances. 'Blue Velvet' is a classic example of a film where 'not everything is as it seems' and much of it is open to interpretation. This one also follows a coherent story, or so you'd think. Look a little closer. Blue Velvet takes us deep into the macabre darkness of American suburbia. And an exhilarating journey it is, from the minuet the camera pans over the lush garden beds bordered by white picket fences, then going for a revealing look under the surface to reveal a nest of insects to the very final scenes, the film really does not let up. And on top of all the sexually charged violence, Blue Velvet is one of the greatest films ever made, and one of Lynch's finest films. It is not to be accepted at face value, there are many layers to the film and it certainly does benefit from repeated viewings. David Lynch's finest achievement, too. Probably one of his more straight forward films, is still strange and out there. I like Lynch and the fact that he has balls to do what he wants to do that isn't the norm of society. People love and hate him for it. Whether you like Lynch or not, you know that the film experience will not be normal and Blue Velvet is no different. Again, one should watch this film more then once, hate to say it but it's true.<br/><br/>With Dennis Hopper, you can almost tell that the role will be somewhat overdone. Only this time it completely calls for it. Frank Booth is a sick and twisted character that is portrayed with gusto from Hopper. When one thinks of Blue Velvet, you can bet your ass the first thing that comes to their mind is Frank Booth. The rest of the cast holds up pretty well.<br/><br/>A lot of the film rests on MacLaclan being believable as the young kid who is tangled up in this mess. You know he's way over his head and you scream at him to get out of the situations at he finds himself in. Dern, who has become a Lynch regular, plays the innocent daughter of the sheriff. Her scenes are nice, but hard to watch when she tries to cry. Dern is usually better than what she serves us here. Rossellini's performances is the one that might stick with you though. While Hopper is having fun in this sick and twisted world, Rossellini's the one that is the tortured soul. The performance is courageous.<br/><br/>The meanings behind Blue Velvet? I'm sure everyone can come up with their own little theme and morality tale. The film isn't told in away the makes it clear, it's always up to the audience and Lynch loves to do that. The opening sequence is great as well. The images and sound convey happy and safe feelings, yet when you watch it you can't help but feel disturbed and unsettled. It's all too cheery and seems to be hiding something. It's only when Lynch takes us deeper down the rabbit hole do we see why we had those feelings.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet isn't for everyone, as is the case with almost every Lynch film. The film has some pretty strong images and undercurrents of sex and violence. Not to mention a ton of other bizarre things to all make up the plot. Wanna watch a film for film class? Try this one, the symbolism alone is enough to write pages about. Blue Velvet review by Steven Gianturco<br/><br/>To call this movie disturbing would be an understatement, yet it's ability to draw you in and keep you rapt in it's psychosis is the mark of it's true brilliance. A quaint little town, known as Lumberton, could be any bedroom community in suburbia. Beneath the facade lies a dark strange world that only Jeffrey begs to discover. It's Jeffrey's obsession that drives this story into places too uncomfortable for the average suburbanite. The acting is over the top, on purpose. Dennis Hopper, in a Nicholsonesque role, owns every scene he is in. Even the auxiliary characters shine. I was particularly impressed with Dean Stockwell's cameo as a pasty faced deviant. One can only imagine being this psychotic, yet these deviants pull it off with a sense of humor. I found myself laughing in all the wrong places, which I think is exactly what the director intended. Isabella Rossilini's troubled character oozes sexual electricity. The good girl, Laura Dern is played with just the right amount of camp. Kyle Maclachlan's obsessed boy character is played to near perfection. Top that off with David Lynch's Hitchcock like direction and you have a symphonic flowing masterpiece. The soundtrack completes the perfection and brings this into a realm of sheer magnificence. David Lynch's first "mainstream movie" turns out to be an almost documentary-like look at the town in which it was shot. Never have I seen a movie capture so completely the duality of a small town like Wilmington, North Carolina. Enlisted personnel from nearby Jacksonville call this "Crack Town"- with good reason. During the day, Wilmington looks like a nice, peaceful resort town; but, at night, the lowlifes come crawling out of the woodwork. As a taxi driver, I dealt with more than my share of them. (One call sent me into a neighborhood where the streetlights had all been shot out. As I rounded a corner, I almost hit half a dozen people who were standing in the middle of the road, in the dark. I swerved just in time, slammed on the brakes, and bent forward to peer through the windshield at them. There were men and women with yellow, sickly eyes staring in at me- and each of them was hugging something to their chest: one man was holding a drawer from a chest of drawers, a woman was clutching a doll baby. I later learned that these were "crack heads" and that they were squeezing these things to their chests because they would tremble uncontrollably from withdrawal if they didn't. Just one instance from 3 and a half years of driving here at night...) (My fellow cabbies called me Crack Man because I always got the crack runs...) Dennis Hopper, as might be expected, steals the show in BLUE VELVET, but Dean Stockwell wins the award as the sleaziest scumbag to ever karaoke on coke. And that's just in the movie... Blue Velvet is definitely a more restrained, less indulgent Lynch (though I kind of like it when he's indulgent), and stylistically the other work it feels closest to is, I think, the Twin Peaks pilot, which I'll be reviewing shortly. Blue Velvet is a little more colorful and "cinematic" but both Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet hold us back just a bit, more than Lynch would do in later Peaks episodes and later movies.<br/><br/>If you want to start off with Lynch, then start with Blue Velvet, because it's still representive of Lynch's distinct style, without it going completely over your head like "Lost Highway", "Inland Empire" or "Mulholland Drive" may do. A spectacular film, and definitely Lynch's finest hour. Blue Velvet is one of the weirdest "American classics" I have ever seen. There are parts of the film that are completely random, bizarre, absurdity and surrealism at it's very best. Well, of course...this is David Lynch, right? But no, it isn't strange like his other movies. Those are unique and uncanny and surreal, but they connect on a dream level, appealing to subconscious tics you didn't even know you had. Not Blue Velvet, at least not for me. I first saw it five years ago, shortly after Mulholland Drive and I couldn't figure out why it was considered the superior film. Its dark-side-of-suburbia theme seemed trite and old-hat, and its surrealism paled in comparison to Mulholland Drive's ethereal atmosphere, which you could sink into and lose yourself. What redeemed its classic status was Dennis Hopper's madcap performance, lurching out of the screen and shocking in ways timeless and indestructible. Other than that, why was Blue Velvet David Lynch's masterpiece? Now, on my second viewing, new thoughts emerge. One: this is Lynch's Breathless; it's the film for people who don't like the rest of the director's oeuvre. Blue Velvet is what you'll find on critics' top 100 lists; it's the token Lynch, or the token surrealism, or even the token avant-garde (just as Breathless frequently appears on the same lists, in lieu of stronger Godard works like Masculin Feminin, Alphaville, or Week End). Yet I think that Blue Velvet, like Breathless, may be a great film after all - you just have to leave the accumulated baggage at the door. Breathless is constantly praised for its "groundbreaking" qualities (if I have to read about those stupid jump cuts one more time, I'll throw my computer out the window) when in fact those very elements were improved and developed in later Godard films. But if you throw out all the "influential" garbage talk (a film is primarily "influential" when there's nothing else interesting to say about it), what remains is a uniquely charming, idiosyncratic, and enjoyable film. Go with the flow instead of trying to take it apart, or seeing it as part of some great pantheon, standing for something. Only then will it yield its charms. So with Blue Velvet, though "charms" hardly seems the appropriate word.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is often portrayed as both a classic deconstruction of American picket fence myths and a prototypical tour of Lynch's peculiar and unique world. But this is a misleading way to set up the film. Firstly, Blue Velvet's world isn't really suburban at all. If anything it's "small town," yet it doesn't fit squarely into Norman Rockwell land either. The town center is full of tall brick buildings which aren't exactly warm and welcoming and even the brightly lit house's interiors have a cold, hollow quality. Something is empty and alienating from the get-go and so the myths that Lynch supposedly wallows in before puncturing them with Hopper's psychosis are never really there. The film, despite being at least partially set in a world of lumber yards and homes with front lawns, has a weirdly urban feel to it, sort of like it's a decaying suburb to a sprawling urban metropolis, like the outskirts of Los Angeles or New York, the corrupted areas people have left for dead.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was Lynch's next film, after the magnificent critical and commercial failure of the science fiction film Dune (perhaps an indicator that Lynch should stick to his surrealist mysteries than venture on the sci-fi train), and gave him an opportunity to prove he could stay on script, on budget, while still creating a distinctly personal work with a dash of the surreal he's known for. He again revisited the theme of beautiful facades covering the darker aspects of life. But he does not ignore his personal vision, Blue Velvet has everything. Surrealism, drama, comedy, and powerhouse performances. It really is an unmissable film, and when someone asks if they should or shouldn't see it, I would definitely advise them to see it, because you cannot explain the film, purely because it's likely to conjure up a thousand different thoughts, opinions and ideas on what the film means. It's an individual experience but one viewed best with an open mind. I first saw Blue Velvet when it came out in 1996, it was and is an utterly mesmerizing cinematic experience - easily became one of my favourite films. It's an amazing mixture of visuals, art, music, characters. It was something totally original, something previously unheard of.<br/><br/>The plot, which revolves around the mystery of a young man discovering a human ear in his seemingly perfect home-town, is as thrilling as some of Hitchocks greatest thrillers, is very finely crafted. Despite its appearance as an erotic thriller, Blue Velvet actually operates on a number of levels, its a coming of age film, a love story, a dark comedy, and the first piece of American surrealist film-making - the film envelops everything.<br/><br/>There really is nothing like it. A perfect ten. Blue Velvet is a mad film, a mad film that takes place in a mad world in which everything is constantly eerie and strangely uncertain and yet the characters that inhabit the part this universe chug along as if it's all as normal a birth, death and tax. In fact the only instances that warrant any reactions of a definite kind are ones of freight, as expressed by protagonist Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan) when it looks as if he will become victim to a mad gangster and damsel in distress (but not as you know it) Dorothy Vallens (Rossellini) whose principal reactions are distress and concern, particularly when faced with the closest she can get to loved ones following a kidnap scenario.<br/><br/>The film begins in a fashion that immediately places it in the realm of the implacable; odd and perhaps disturbing images in a cacophony of visuals that do not match, but Lynch knows they don't match, thus getting across firstly the setting of the film; in a suburban American world inspired by the decade of the 1950s and secondly, the ambiance of the film. In this sense it is what you might be familiar with and what you might perceive to be 'idyllic' or 'perfect' but is actually far from it. The shots of quaint suburban houses and fire trucks going by in slow-motion are juxtaposed by an old man suffering a stroke and close ups of beetles fighting in the undergrowth, simple but effective in establishment and atmosphere.<br/><br/>But for all the complications that arise when certain scenes happen, Blue Velvet begins as routinely and as straight forward as you could imagine. Jeffery, our young and outgoing hero, is out walking and just happens to stumble across a human ear in a grassy field on the way home. For all the supposedly complicated studies of fetishisms and attention to cross-genres that follow, Lynch shoots this scene almost purposely unspectacularly in an attempt to maybe lure the audience into a false sense of spectacle. I think Lynch identifies the passive viewer looking at what's on the surface there in front of them but also identifies the active viewer looking at what's beneath the surface; he shoots the initial incident which acts as the catalyst of the whole film in a mundane manner consisting of mid-shot, close up and then the guy picks the item up.<br/><br/>So this deliberately spectacular event (I can't remember too many other instances where someone finds an ear in a film) is shot unspectacularly and what follows is the expected trip to the police station and that intrigue young blood possesses, not helped out by the fact Jeffery is attracted to detective work anyway and the police won't give him a clue. He lets female friend Sandy Williams (Dern) in on the find and they go off inspecting once they get Dorothy's address through one way or another. It's the initial scenes involving Dorothy that perhaps give the film its cult status; scenes that tap into voyeurism and fetishism while definitely delivering on a dramatic level at the same time.<br/><br/>Jeffery is initially caught by Dorothy but the voyeurism isn't necessarily there since he is forced to hide from her anyway. I do not think Jeffery gets a sexual thrill out of seeing Dorothy go about her business prior to Frank Booth entering but once he is caught, the study begins to form. Initially, Dorothy panics at someone being in her room but changes her tack quite quickly, quickly becoming the dominant half of a relationship that has lasted a mere ten seconds whilst armed with a knife. Enter Frank Booth (Hopper) and Jeffery is back hiding in the wardrobe; now following the apparent immediacy of a sex act prior to this scene. The manner in which Dorothy changes her mind and tries to get one back up of Jeffery for watching alerts the audience and primes them for the scenes with Frank to come; scenes of a fetishistic nature.<br/><br/>As a stand alone character, the film is greatly indebted to him for its cult status. It is the character of Frank as not just another gangster that spouts dialogue and kidnaps people that makes this film; he is a human being in a world whom has fetishes and quirks and if he is a stereotype then he is one with preferences. From here, the activity that follows has Dorothy now know she is being watched and the fetishistic acts cover a range of bizarre needs, throwing in sadomasochism and infantilism (once Frank spouts 'Mommy!') to a mix already containing the want for gags, velvets, gasmasks and scissors to cut clothes. Following on from the previous scene with Jeffery, Dorothy is suddenly relegated to the role of the submissive and Jeffery is dumped back down to the role of the voyeur with Frank as the dominant figure, something he carries with him throughout the film and something Lynch introduces to us in these very scenes.<br/><br/>So Blue Velvet is a success, less so for its 'cult' status thanks to scenes the mainstream are perhaps unfamiliar with but more so for its effectiveness in the build up to its interesting plot and fascinating characters. The film borrows from noir in the sense it's a 1950s inspired world that they live and the film follows a detective route. Guns, gangsters and a hapless guy in too deep is just some of the fun to be had out of Blue Velvet, but I use 'fun' in a careful manner. David Lynch wrote and directed this film about the dirty little secrets of an otherwise seemingly perfect urban neighborhood. Clearly Dennis Hopper steals the show and a whole star is added just because of his performance as an abusive, drug-addicted sadist. All the strangeness starts when clean-cut Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) finds a human ear in a field near his home. A mystery unfolds involving a sexy but disturbed nightclub singer (Isabella Rossellini) and a group of thugs led by Frank who is played by Dennis Hopper. Dean Stockwell also adds to the film with his small but memorable role as Franks eccentric, drug-dealing friend. Jeffrey recruits his friend and love interest, Sandy, played by Laura Dern, to help him solve the mystery. The score and camera work help to make the film feel like a dream. A questionable scene or two and some cheesy dialog hold this back from being an even better movie but its consistent dream-like feel and Dennis Hopper as Frank make it a a film you'll want to watch more then once. Good Stuff! Lots of directors have exposed the rot at the core of white-picket-fence America, but David Lynch picks past the clichés and finds screaming insects, a severed ear, S&M sexual episodes, and a psycho with an oxygen mask. More than that, he merges them all into an eroticized Hardy Boys dream of good and evil.... there has never been, and probably will never be, a film like Blue Velvet... something so unsettling, so disturbingly dark yet hauntingly beautiful and erotic.<br/><br/>Featuring Dennis Hopper in one of his most iconic roles, Blue Velvet is set in a very typical American town - flower beds, picket fences, diners and a high school complete with cheerleaders and jocks. But something isn't quite right here, and Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), a young college student, is the first to discover that. David Lynch has never and probably will never craft another film like this. Original, taunting, dark, beautiful, surreal, ironic, sexual and nightmarish. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love. The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt. I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame. It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time. But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to. It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man get's caught up in the evil, and is forced to pick a side. It's strangely funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth. It's sick and disturbing, but at the same time brilliant. And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it. It just is what it is. It's real. No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows. And no one does anything about it. In essence, "Blue Velvet" is the ultimate satire of sleaze in suburbia, an amazing work of American surrealism, and one of the ultimate film experiences. It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining. This David Lynch chiller just may make your skin crawl.<br/><br/>Ever wonder what rotting secrets lie buried underneath the picket fence perfection of suburban America? Well, David Lynch is here to show you. "Blue Velvet" is actually one of Lynch's more accessible films in terms of linearity and conventional storytelling, but it still manages to deeply disturb. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are the two youngsters who get trapped in this particular Lynchian rabbit hole, and Dennis Hopper (terrifying) and Isabella Rossellini are the grotesques they find there. What follows plays out like the kind of dream you would have if you were running a temperature of 102.<br/><br/>Don't be put off though -- as creepy and disturbing as the film is, it's also very funny in that way that only Lynch films can be (meaning that you'll laugh but you'll probably be squirming as you do).<br/><br/>Grade: A 'Blue Velvet' is a determinedly odd film from the determinedly odd director, David Lynch. It is set in two worlds really; the normal everyday world where most of us live and work and an utterly depraved one just below the surface that is disturbingly easy to enter if one wishes. This is what happens to Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), after he makes the bizarre discovery of a human ear in a vacant lot near his home. His curiosity is such that even after reporting it to the police, he determines to find out the story behind it on his own, and that is when he plunges into a netherworld of sadomasochism, drugs and murder. The central plot concerns a nightclub singer, Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) and Frank (Dennis Hopper), a vicious criminal. They have a violent sexual relationship which is in part due to the fact that Frank is blackmailing her and in part to her own masochistic tendencies. Jeffrey sneaks into her apartment looking for clues one day; she discovers him and they have a brief intimate encounter, then Frank shows up. While Jeffrey hides in the closet, he witnesses one of Frank and Dorothy's strange sexual episodes. This scene pretty much gives us an idea of what's in store. The main character in 'Blue Velvet' is Frank, a thoroughly repulsive yet fascinating psychopath. He is quite clearly insane and extremely violent. He comes across as an unhinged version of 'Cape Fear's' Max Cady, a truly sadistic bully who in this case is a drug addict as well. Anything and everything can send him into a rage. Hopper's portrayal of him is frighteningly believable; you come to believe the man is capable of any atrocity at any time. There are points in the movie where his actions and statements are so over the top, they invite nervous laughter but more often than not, they're just creepy. Perhaps the most memorably warped scene is one where Frank and his cronies abduct Jeffrey. First, he is taken to a house where Ben (Dean Stockwell) and others are drinking and doping; in what apparently is a common ritual, Ben lip-syncs to old songs. On this night, it is Roy Orbison's 'In Dreams,' which at first reduces Frank to a maudlin state, then drives him into a frenzy. The drug-fueled madness continues as several of them pile into a car and drive recklessly to a milling yard, where Frank beats Jeffrey senseless and leaves him for dead, while 'In Dreams' plays in the background. 'Blue Velvet' is revered in some circles though even jaded critics admitted to being startled by the movie's extreme nature. It is a difficult film to watch; in particular, some of Isabella Rossellini's scenes practically make one cringe. It is hard not to admire Lynch's directing skills, though, just as it's impossible to forget Dennis Hopper's performance. ...Quotes Frank Booth, the central villain in David Lynch's classic "Blue Velvet", spun from the darkest depths of the human sole. This is as far as American art goes, if it even has gone this far before. Before making his disturbing 1986 masterpiece, David Lynch had already established himself as a director with Eraserhead (1977) and The Elephant Man (1980). Although Blue Velvet is perhaps Lynch's most mainstream film, it also hints at the darker, more surreal Lynch Universe. Set in the small town of Lumberton, North Carolina, the film tells the story of a college student, Jeffrey Beamount (Kyle MacLachlan), who finds a severed human ear in a grassy field in his neighbourhood.<br/><br/>He decides to investigate the mystery with his sweet-as-pie girlfriend, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), the daughter of the town sheriff. Their investigation leads them into the darker underworld of small-town America, populated by sociopathic perverts like Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), nightclub singers (with a fetish for sexual bondage) like Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), and characterized by drug addiction, violence, sexual slavery, voyeurism, and raw emotional energy. Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks) brings his trademark musical brilliance to the highly-recommended cult classic like no-other. To describe the aura of David Lynch's 1986 masterpiece would be challenging. Not only is the atmosphere of the non-descript Smalltown U.S.A. simple and innocent, it manages to have that same bleak and weary feel we've become so used to seeing in Lynch's films. The story is original: boy finds ear in field, boy wants to know more about why he found a severed ear, boy gets confidential information regarding the case, boy hides out in a crimescene closet, boy gets discovered by bad guys and then boy endures punishment etc... But the real keepers here are the scenes with Dean Stockwell. A scene not to be missed is "A candy colored Clown they call the sandman", when Frank (Dennis Hopper) demands for Stockwell to sing to him Roy Orbison's 'In Dreams'. During the course of the song, Frank can't take it anymore, the music is too powerful, overwhelming him with beauty and therefore stops the tape. There are many more scenes that left me breathless and gasping for more, but I will leave that to you the viewer to go out and discover.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a truly twisted, superb example of American art at its very best. Unmissable. A film like this should be watched with only the utmost trepidation, or that's the impression I'd been given by most reviews and comment I'd seen regarding the film. Now, don't get me wrong, I will agree that Blue Velvet does contain some graphic scenes, but really now, I've seen worse, a lot worse. I really feel I must convey this by putting a short review here, as there is so much talk of this film being borderline unwatchable.<br/><br/>Anyway, to the film itself. The direction and pacing was satisfactory; not being an expert on either, all I can say is that the film never left me bored, and I was kept glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next - a good watching experience. Never at one point did I think that even one tiny part of the film was gratuitous in it's use of violence, and there is a strong undercurrent of innocent, and not so innocent, romance. The viewer is kept guessing about a lot of the character's intentions during what is essentially a great detective story.<br/><br/>Anyway, as you can see, I'm no film expert, but while this isn't "one for all the family" I think there are a lot of people missing out on Blue Velvet due to it's reputation. Don't be one of them, give this great film a try. Blue Velvet is a cinematic masterpiece almost without peer. David Lynch ("Twin Peaks", "The Elephant Man", "Dune") has taken a small safe town from americas suburbs and has turned it into a festering hole for evil and all of its henchman. He explores the duality of man and woman using some of the most perfectly portrayed characters ever created. David Lynch dares the viewer to hang in there and think for themselves. Besides all of the above mentioned Blue Velvet has all of the cream of the crop, much repeated, and criminally hard to forget lines ever written. The film is one of the most iconic, unforgettable and distinctive films to come out of American cinema for years. This is a genuine classic not to be missed. David Lynch's provocative film, BLUE VELVET, is a dark masterpiece of post-modern art. For what does all art aspire to do? I would claim, to tear away our illusions of the world in which we live; To strip away the false façade and reveal to us that which we do not want to see, but that we know is there. Lynch does this by attacking a small town and removing the idyllic surface and showing us all the murk that boils beneath. My favourite shot in the film is of a bed of roses, where Lynch has added (through his brilliant use of audio) a surreal, distorted noise that sounds like a thousand insects creeping and crawling. Dennis hopper stars as the embodiment of evil, Jack Booth, who's truly one of the most psychotic persons to ever appear on film. He has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Kyle Maclachlan's characters sums it all up by asking, "why are there people like Frank?" But there's also beauty in this film. Isabella Rossilini standing on stage singing the title song, BLUE VELVET, is a wonderful image. Lynch isn't just preoccupied with tearing away at everything. Once in a while he seems prepared to start building things up again from scratch; Certainly there's hope somewhere. BLUE VELVET is easily one of the most important contemporary American films. It's a must see for any one interested in film (not having seen BLUE VELVET for a film buff is like an art student not having seen Picasso's painting of the Spanish civil war). This is a beautiful movie, set up like a stone in a setting by director David Lynch's trademark eccentric lighting. The photography and the sets are gorgeous; the mix of symbols and references and visual styles was daring in its time and the whole experience of seeing it is as much the unrolling of a scroll as it is of watching a movie.<br/><br/>The story looks like a William S. Burroughs adaptation of a Hardy Boys mystery. Teenagers stumble on a mystery and, gee whiz, they deced to solve it. Instead of buried treasure, it involves electronically amflified sadists crazed by brain-implanted drugs and wearing leather, velvet, lace and rubber fetish suits. There's an occasional mutilated corpse thrown in.<br/><br/>At its release in 1987, Blue Velvet and its creator were unexpected surpises from a Hollywood where the scripts seem to be generated by a computer that watches a lot of television. Today, the movie seems a bit full of itself, somewhat pretentious (recurring shots of a symbolic flame), and the plot seems less satisfying and all too simple. The world of horrors that's revealed in the first part of the film is resolved rather stupidly at the end, but its a cinematic milestone that is a worth watching by any film buff. Set in the small town of Lumberton, North Carolina, the film tells the story of a college student, Jeffrey Beamount (Kyle MacLachlan), who finds a severed human ear in a grassy field in his neighbourhood. He decides to investigate the mystery with his sweet-as-pie girlfriend, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), the daughter of the town sheriff. Their investigation leads them into the darker underworld of small-town America, populated by sociopathic perverts like Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), nightclub singers (with a fetish for sexual bondage) like Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), and characterized by drug addiction, violence, sexual slavery, voyeurism, and raw emotional energy. Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks) brings his trademark musical brilliance to the highly-recommended cult classic.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a film that is here to reassure us that it is a strange world, and that darkness and beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places. Highly recommended. Lynch tends to be the only one to get Oscar nods for his films. He deserves it, but so do the actors.<br/><br/>Hopper owned this film from front to back. Admit it. He was evil but you still wanted to hang around him. It's a dark situation people hope they can escape from, but they still enter into it.<br/><br/>Kyle did justice to the lead as well. His fear was felt from the start. I had to wonder why Booth let his character live from the beginning though. That seemed inconsistent with the role.<br/><br/>The dark highway was a given. And the small town vibe getting screwed with is a Lynchian trademark. The trickery at the end wasn't so stunning, but then Lynch redeemed himself by making it clear it wasn't supposed to be.<br/><br/>Is this Dave's best? Probably. This hallucinogenic mystery-thriller from cult director Lynch explores the twisted underside of small-town American life, fusing noirish elements of mood and atmosphere with a classic Hitchcockian whodunit, complete with all the voyeuristic elements of "Rear Window". Lynch's imprint is everywhere, including MacLachlan's deliberately trance-like acting, Rossellini's melodramatic damsel-in-distress, and Hopper's iconic over-the-top (but brilliant, Oscar worthy) turn as the angry, liquid-ether-huffing sadist who has a strange and violently sexual hold on Dorothy. Even the music--the Bobby Vinton song and Angelo Badalamenti's eerie score--completes the director's disquieting effect. Filmed in gorgeous Technicolor, "Blue Velvet" is a lurid parable about innocence and evil film that mystery/noir fans will find irresistible, but should also appeal to those that enjoy a walk on the wild side, because this certainly qualifies as a film like no other. Blue Velvet is a beautiful and poetic masterpiece. Never in the history of cinema has there been such a terrifying profane, fabric swatch-loving villain than Frank Booth, who if you have seen the film, is most likely to have left a permanent scar on your cerebral cortex. Before David Lynch unleashed the evil Frank, we'd never seen a villain inflict quite such a queasy mix of physical, verbal, and sexual abuse on a victim. It's still hard to watch Frank's initial tryst with sultry, seductive singer Dorothy Vallens, who, as played by Isabella Rossellini, seems both terrified and turned on. And as Frank swigs Pabst Blue Ribbon and huffs nitrous oxide, it's also hard not to think about Hopper's own battles with drugs and booze, adding to the tightrope tension.<br/><br/>If your a Hopper fan, this is not to be missed! In addition, if your a fan of David Lynch, or anything nightmarish and macarabe, then Blue Velvet is your film. Otherwise...well, watch the film with an open mind.

In the erotic masterpiece Blue Velvet, David Lynch digs away at the pervasive savagery and evil lurking in the shadows of a seemingly normal, wholesome small town. When wide-eyed college student Jeffrey Beaumont returns from a visit of his father in hospital, he comes across a human ear buried under a grass field. The ear capitulates Jeffrey into a dark murder mystery that gradually reveals his town's darkest secrets, which are rustled from cover. Blue Velvet's sordid plot-lines involving hardcore drug use, sexual perversion, and a malevolent supernatural force shocked the movie industry and open doors to a whole new realm of film-making. The fascinated aspects of Blue Velvet are the quirky townspeople, heavy sex, violence and off-beat atmosphere had a profound effect on cinema.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a unique, hugely entertaining murder mystery. And don't be fooled, its not a typical, mechanical thriller that has nothing under its glossy surface. It is fall of creepy Fraudian subtext and heavy symbolism that makes Blue Velvet a complex, terrifyingly nightmarish but beautiful classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich and often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. Angelo Badalamenti's sweet, haunting but perfect theme begins as smokestacks billow, flowers bloom, people water their gardens and a robin assures the viewer of the presence of love in a little town located through the pines, just this side of sanity...or reality. Complete with Isabella Rossellini's sultry, seductive voice and red lipstick, Dennis Hopper's random, eccentric obscenity-fueled outbursts and the haunting, but beautifully dreamlike Lynchian atmosphere. Either way you choose to look at it (and the choice is yours), this groundbreaking classic grabbed the viewer in its seductive and destructive web... and wouldn't let go. It revolted and amazed audiences and has earned a spot as a re-watchable, indisputable classic of cinema. Blue Velvet is a stunning and explosive film that is often misunderstood by its viewers as a simple crime drama. It is so much more than that, it is American surrealism and the best example of it.<br/><br/>A groundbreaking cinematic masterpieceWATCH IT!!! This has always been a very distinctive, recognizable crime film. It is filtered with quirky characters, bizarre surrealism and strong violent sexuality. The central villain of the film is a very disturbed, sick man. Almost as disturbed is Isabella Rossellini, an at once normal mother, turned seductive masochist. Dorothy's husband and son were kidnapped by Frank. While they are kidnapped, Dorothy must obey Frank's commands, including SDM sex, otherwise he will kill both her husband and son.<br/><br/>David Lynch (director of Twin Peaks and the biographical film The Elephant Man) has created a dreamlike, haunting noir film that is at times both beautiful and nightmarishly depraved. It's an examination of the corruption that lies behind the seemingly immaculate exterior of suburban America, and boasts an amazing array of talent. Not to be missed. David lynchs blue velvet is a film that traces the idea that there is good and evil in the world and it can be found in the smallest of idealic places,and sometimes you don't even know its there,the sleepy village of lumberton as featured here is one such example. Kyle maclachlan plays jeffrey,a student who returns to the village to see his sick dad,he then happens to fins an ear in the grass and reports it,but his curiosity gets the better of him and with some help from the sheriffs daughter he decides to find things out for himself and along the way meets dorothy,played brilliantly by isabella rossellini,who is a slave to the excellent frank,played by dennis hopper who has kidnapped her son,events unravel as fear and darkness become reality. <br/><br/>The film has a more A to B narrative that most of lynchs movie but the film still has its twists and surreal moments,hopper is immense here as a criminal with so much hate inside,he breathes through an oxygen mask for a few seconds and then goes on a barrage of abuse and torture,this is a classic in many ways. I have greatly admired David Lynch's work for a long time, and though I have not always enjoyed his films on a basic level, I have always admired him as a film maker. I don't think Blue Velvet is his best film, but I think it is the film in which he truly mastered a style which is entirely his own. Blue Velvet is the type of movie that is completely beyond generic convention. It is a romance, a crime thriller, and an "experimental" film all in one.<br/><br/>The characters are bizarre, but extremely well done. The small town characters are in the beginning hokey, but as the plot becomes more complex it's almost as if the actors themselves become more serious, not just the characters. It's a beautiful symbolism for small town life; a veneer of of quiet mediocrity at face value, but with a dramatic and complex core. Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini are obviously the stand-out performance, each seemingly trying to out do the other in sheer madness.<br/><br/>The plot itself is a very interesting one, and it is told very well. One feels the determination and the helplessness of Jeffery who lunges into a world beyond his control. And it is fascinating how he manages to concur it in the end.<br/><br/>This may not be a film that everyone will enjoy, but I think it is a film that will interest a very wide audience. I think it's a great introduction to Lynch, and an important film in modern cinema. David Lynch (Eraserhead, The Elephant Man) is such a unique artist. Although Blue Velvet is perhaps Lynch's most mainstream film, it also hints at the darker, more surreal Lynch Universe. Set in the small town of Lumberton, North Carolina, the film tells the story of a college student, Jeffrey Beamount (Kyle MacLachlan), who finds a severed human ear in a grassy field in his neighbourhood. He decides to investigate the mystery with his sweet-as-pie girlfriend, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), the daughter of the town sheriff. Their investigation leads them into the darker underworld of small-town America, populated by sociopathic perverts like Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), nightclub singers (with a fetish for sexual bondage) like Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), and characterized by drug addiction, violence, sexual slavery, voyeurism, and raw emotional energy. Angelo Badalamenti (who also did the score for Lynch's Twin Peaks) brings his trademark musical brilliance to this original classic.<br/><br/>In summary, although at times the film can be quite over the top, and it is extremely violent and very sexually explicit, which may be considered distasteful to some viewers, it is an unforgettable movie that I highly recommend. As my headline implies, this is David Lynch's greatest movie. It is full of beauty, darkness, and frequently mixes a decaying, depraved atmosphere with a beautiful, innocent one. The performances are amazing, and the symbolism is extensive.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan finds himself embroiled in a murder mystery in his picture-postcard small town environs of Lumberton. He plays the clean cut Jeffrey Beaumont, who whilst returning form a visit to his hospitalised father, makes the shocking discovery of a severed human ear. After reporting his discovery to a local police detective, Jeffery decides to pursue his own line of enquiry, aided by the detective's daughter, Sandy Laura Dern. This sets Jeffrey on a voyage of discovery that takes him to the very heart of Lumberton's seedy and sinister underworld where he encounters a collection of misfits who's various chronic compulsions to engulf him in their twisted and nightmarish world.<br/><br/>Highly recommended viewing! Its considerably difficult to grasp a film like "Blue Velvet". I've been told by a friend that it takes multiple viewings to fully grasp the movie; even doing so isn't sufficiant enough. The film looks, on the surface, like a relatively typical Hollywood crime movie. But actually, its a very layered film, full of complicated symbolism and Fraudian themes. This is typical David Lynch...although its not his best work.<br/><br/>Although Blue Velvet isn't the best Lynch has to offer, its an exceptional film. A lot of people seem to think its a classic, however I dispute this. Some of the dialog is very hookey, and occasionally cheesy, the sex and violence (which is often very distasteful) often seems to serve no real purpose other than to be exploitive, the film can be quite misogynist to women, and the performances don't represent good acting ability (don't get me started on Laura Dern), in fact that on real good performance in the movie was Dennis Hopper's portrayal of the crazed sadist Frank Boothe, and the score at times can be quite a distraction and the film its littered with plot holes. However, it is a very good movie, just not a "masterpiece" or a "classic" like many hold it up as. Blue Velvet is a wonderful movie, a typical Lynch movie dealing with strange, complex characters, or better said dealing with the dark, merely unknown side of humanity. A very interesting thing about D L's movies is the way he gets from normal, silly, plain side to the strange, hidden, subconscious, dark parts of human beings. A very important element in the movie is the music, a nice delicate , soft music on the surface if we think about the lyrics but Lynch used music in a different way, the music is seen as a threat, externalizing Frank's inner passions, a music that serves evil purposes. I voted 8/10 just because i considered Laura Dern's role to be not as good as in Wild at heart, this is not one of her best performance. On the other hand, Hopper has a very good performance playing the traumatized boy in search of an incestuous relationship with his mother( read Lacan). The movie is not that easy to be understood and not that easy to be forgotten. Lynch creates an amazing film in Blue Velvet. I would have to say that it is one of the most grotesque and horrifying films I have ever seen. I don't think that is because any element of the film in and of itself is nightmarish. Instead, the background of suburbia with its white picket fences and pastel colors only makes the extremely dark film noir that much darker. The song Blue Velvet, in itself has a warm innocence to it. I also love the use of Orbison's "In Dreams" which completely changes the meaning of the song to fit Frank's twisted psyche. The character of Frank (Dennis Hopper) is one of the scariest "movie villain" of all time, which says a lot of his performance in the film. I went into this film expecting Eraserhead, this film is not as abstract of a thing and yet I was not disappointed. I believe that this is the type of film Quintin Terrintino has been trying to make for years, a darker version of a classic crime drama. David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, The Elephant Man) took audiences worldwide to terrifying new heights with his deeply affecting sexual drama on American suburbia at its worse, a noir thriller for the 1980s. Sounds simple? Wrong. The film combines so many conventions it's unbelievably difficult situation to try to pin a genre on it. It is also deeply dark and disturbing, while the story is still somewhat convoluted. When I first saw it on video, I couldn't sleep. I could still hear 'In Dreams' in my head, and see Dean Stockwell eerily dancing to the song, the dreamlike visuals, the sadistic rape scene. Everything stuck with me. And years later, the film still numbs me. Something with this kind of power deserves my praise. We are lured into this false sense of security, and then everything turns on us and we realize were in the darkest realms, a place we'd only see in our very worst nightmares.<br/><br/>Everything is played out perfectly in Blue Velvet. The score, the noir feel, the visuals, the actingit's a thriller that rivals Hitchcock. Though it's long, there is never a dull, forgettable moment. It is an unforgettably fascinating world that seems so vague and unfamiliar, yet so recognizable. This film was recently listed on the UK's Total Film magazines 100 Greatest Movies chosen by the British public; this might make up for its very surprising absence on the American Film Institution's Top 100 re-release. But then again, who cares what they think? Lists are lists. Along with Mulholland Dr., this is Lynch's masterpiece, but more accessible. I think it is a spiritual study, concerning the loss of innocence and the consequent discovery, and after that acceptance, of the intimate duality of good and evil, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil, within the context of a recreated post-war Americana influenced by the paintings of Edward Hopper, surrealism and RKO film noir of the 1940's.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern give touching performances as the young man Jeffrey and his girlfriend, Sandy. Rosselini has never been better, a kind of demented version of her real mother, Ingrid Bergman and Hopper gives a career-saving and inimitable performance (with the exception of Christopher Walken) as the embodiment of mad wickedness, Frank Booth.<br/><br/>And, of course, Badalamenti's nuanced score, as usual, compliments Lynch's film perfectly. Blue Velvet shocked audiences back in 1986; it inspired a huge response from widespread acclaim to complete abomination. It is, today, widely considered a dominant example of 1980s new wave American cinema, and today as one of the greatest American films ever made. It was an art-house independent feature, yet its success catapulted it to mainstream fame. I saw it and was mesmerized, yet some 20-21 years later, the film doesn't hold so well. Upon a second viewing, it seems shallow and lacks depth. For example, it appears to be one of those 'typical' thrillers that warn terribly with age. Blue Velvet as been described as being absorbing, yet it is hardly that absorbing. It has been considered art in the likes of Dali, it is not art, it is a collection of jumbled images that intercept the plot now and then. It has been described as a study of voyeurism and sexual corruption, when it is merely a The film doesn't go beyond a "weird take on America", which has been done countless times before.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is shocking and offers a jolting experience, but it isn't satisfying in all the aspects that a film with its stature should be. Good if you're looking for a thriller that will take you on for a ride, lacking in areas that matter. See Lynch's deeper, more complex films such as Lost Highway, or Mulholland Dr., which challenge the viewer with richer, more enticing stories. Blue Velvet ***½ / ***** Watching David Lynch's Blue Velvet is an experience in uncomfortable whimsy. Imagine being in a field of flowers on a nice day, except those flowers are giving you an allergy attack that would kill an elephant and a mosquito is biting you on the ear. Painting his favorite canvas (small town America) with his favorite medium (darkness), Lynch transforms rural Lumberton into post-meltdown Chernobyl had the locals decided not to move away. This film is not escapist fare.<br/><br/>Young Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) is home from college to visit his father, who has suffered a stroke. Walking around his neighborhood he finds an ear covered in ants. A human ear? A human ear, alright. Disappointed by the police' nonchalance, Jeff decides to investigate for himself. He is soon partnered with Sandy (Laura Dern), the sweetly innocent high school student and daughter of the police chief. Their investigation starts out unfolding like a Hardy Boys novel, but soon their escapades take a turn for the surreal. Add a masochistic lounge singer (Isabella Rossellini) and an amyl nitrate-huffing psychopath (Dennis Hopper) and you have pure Lynchian dystopia.<br/><br/>The identification of Blue Velvet as a singularity in film history is established within three minutes of the opening credits. I don't want to ruin anything in particular, but the point at which I speak will be obvious. The pacing is unique in that he interchange between small town charm and menacing underbelly, for the most part, is totally unexpected.<br/><br/>Lumberton is a land of Formica tables and Felix the Cat clocks. As colorful as some of the locations are, Lynch manages to make them seem drab and menacing. The lumberjack buying an ax from the hardware store could just as easily be planning to use it to split someone's head open as cut down a tree. We never know what is behind those faces. Frederic Elmes' camera meanders its way into the cracks of the small town, exposing its dark side.<br/><br/>MacLachlan and Dern's performances are decidedly understated. This is important because between Rossellini's perverse sexuality and Hopper's foul-mouthed ferocity there is little flamboyance left to go around. Hopper is the film's shining light (be it a black-light). He's terrifying, strange, loud, obnoxious, and he loves Pabst Blue Ribbon ('Heineken?! F*ck that sh*t!). Everybody else in the film acts like Dave from 2001: A Space odyssey; stone faced and contained. Hopper is the perfect foil.<br/><br/>The film is not without its problems. The relationship between MacLachlan and Dern is overplayed and they share some pretty hammy dialogue. The ending is unnecessarily ambiguous; abstract to the point of pretentiousness. Lynch's symbolism can get a bit heavy-handed at times and his praxis of Rossellini's abused character borders on exploitation. Other than that, Blue Velvet is a good watch if you are feeling analytical or need inspiration for your latest Hieronymus Bosch tribute painting. Blue Velvet is a true masterpiece, clearly the greatest, most influential example of cinema from the '80s. Like something that was wrenched from the surreal dreams of Salvador Dali, images in this movie are dark, beautiful, funny, disturbing, thought-provoking, and profound, all at the same time. This is truly a movie you can watch multiple times and find new themes each time. It is strange, but it doesn't go completely overboard into strangeness like many of Lynch's other movies (Lost Highway, Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive), which probably is why Blue Velvet has become such a highly regarded motion picture. An experience like this cannot, and probably will not be matched for decades to come. BLUE VELVET is another David Lynch film that messes with the audience in a deeper way then his films usually do. It doesn't mess with the audience in a narrative way. It messes with them in the way that, no matter what you expect to get out of this movie, you will always view something different. Before watching this, I really didn't have any idea what I was getting into. I mean, i knew it was David Lynch. I love David Lynch. ERASERHEAD, MULLHOLLAND DR., FIRE WALK WITH ME, THE STRAIGHT STORY, and THE ELEPHANT MAN are some of my favorite films. BLUE VELVET, however, I definitely did not enjoy. When a young man finds an ear in a field, he is pulled down into the dark recesses of human nature and must escape. He encounters a woman who is in serious trouble with a strange drug addict named Frank and tries to help her but may only be making things worse. This is a disturbing film. It's a good and interesting film, but the whole aspect of what the viewer is shown s just wrong. The dark tone of the film is so perfect in conjunction with the light look of the friendly neighborhood the film takes place in. Most may feel that this would make it a satire, but it most certainly is not. It is a depiction of the worst kind of human behavior shown in a light that it is never shown in. It's a very effective way for shock, but this is not a shock film. this is a well made film with a good story and truly awful characters. I've viewed BLUE VELVET several times and I do think it is worth seeing. I'm not really sure if it's easy to draw any kind of definitive meaning to the film, but i would say, even for the haters, that David Lynch is an undeniably effective filmmaker. It may not be pretty to look at, but at least the artist knows it and has done what he set out to do. first off, i'd say there say there are plenty of words to sum up blue velvet, and in my opinion these are them: work of art, classic, dark, and surreal. some people say that David lynch just makes films that are senseless (people quite often take eraserhead as an example) but i think this makes a director that i hadn't heard of much and turns him into an idol. almost everything is brilliant, particularly machlachans performance as Jeffrey, being thrown out of his regular life into the dark, unsettling underworld of lumberton. and of course, i couldn't miss out Dennis hoppers astounding portrayal of frank booth, one of the ultimate villains of film, and Isabella rosselini as Dorothy vallens, the enigmatic,emotionally torn apart woman who just wanted to sing blue velvet. the only thing i didn't really like is sandy talking about the robins. i thought that was a little off but that isn't too serious is it? Blue Velvet (1986) David Lynch. People either love his work, or hate him. Lynch's movies often follow a strange narrative and often require at least two viewings to get the clear picture. "Blue Velvet" seems to differ away from the path. Named after a fabric that can be created from any fiber and is extremely hard to clean, "Blue Velvet" is just that. The movie begins in the small town of Lumberton, it begins peaceful and normal. But the story takes a small twist when Jeffery finds a severed ear in a field. The film takes on a classic 1950-1970's young detective feel to it. The young innocent guy and gal trying to figure out where the ear came from. The movie takes a deep and dark turn once Jeffery hides in the closet of Dorothy Vallens and sees the dark side of life. Jeffery wants to look away, but is drawn too the darker side. The film begins to take a Jekyll and Hyde feel with day and night. During the day the film reverts back to the teenage detective feel, and during night it shifts to a world of pleasure, pain and danger with Jeffery in smack in the middle of it. Jeffery has become tainted by his nightlife and tries to come clean and leave it to the cops and leaves Dorothy alone, but much like velvet, it's very hard to come clean. The night life follows Jeffery home. Many other characters begin to take on a two faced feel to them, Frank dons a disguise as a well dressed man, the yellow man works as a detective and a mob enforcer, or Dorothy, who is only shown during the night time as an abused woman who has lost her husband and child. Dorothy is only shown twice during the day, when Jeffery visit visits the apartment and everything seems fine, and during the end of the movie when she is in the park with her son.<br/><br/>On the surface "Blue Velvet" seems to be a straight foreword romantic thriller, but there are signs that it may all just be a dream like Mulholland Drive. Mulholland Drive begun with a zoom in to a pillow and the sound of someone fainting, in "Blue Velvet", the camera zooms into an ear. During Blue Velvet there's several shots of a flickering candle in the wind. These shots are shown throughout the movie, but are heavily shown in it's entirety when Jeffery is having a nightmare after his night out with Frank. The dream comes to an end at the end of the movie when the camera zooms out of the ear, and the final scene is with Jeffery and Sandy are happy in a bright world much like the opening scene of the movie. Where Mulholland Drive was a dream about guilt, regret and anger, Blue Velvet could very well be a cautionary dream about slipping deeper into the darkness of Jeffery's own mind and what he's afraid of becoming.<br/><br/>As a painter, David Lynch knows that all the components are needed to create a good movie. Lynch's knowledge as a painter and director comes through with well angled shots and great color placement. Lynch's obsession with sound is also utilized, the perfect songs are used and fits the mood perfectly, carefully going from bubblegum pop songs to dark and menacing themes. "Blue Velvet" is the first movie where David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti worked together, creating a professional relationship that has lasted 20 years. Fans of Lynch's work will find plenty of Lynch trademarks within "Blue Velvet": Highway at night (night ride with Frank), red curtains (in the diner, also a Lynch trademark), women in trouble (Dorothy), use of dreams (see above), extreme close ups (zoom into the ear), and head injury (severed ear).<br/><br/>On the surface many people will find "Blue Velvet" to be one of the easiest Lynch film to understand, it could be taken as a romantic thriller with a few weird twists, or it could very well be something deeper and darker. This film is excellent. Dennis Hopper is so perfect for the part of Frank Booth, no one would have done it any better, he is the ultamate criminal if you ask me, so convincing, absolutely mad and scary. Thats the character that makes the film which has a brilliant script over spilling with black humour. David Lynch really plays around with his audience. Isabella Rosellini is great too, some really twisted erotic scenes. This is an all time classic. This film has those first scenes depicting that every beautiful garden has the insects lurking bellow under the grass echoed all throughout the film. I have watched this movie numerable times and I'm sure I will be watching it again in the future, its that good. "Blue Velvet" (1986) was the film that saved David Lynch's career after the muddled epic that was "Dune" in 1984. Armed with a truly unique and brilliant script, and again working with his "Dune" actor Kyle MacLachlan, he brings this film to life (earning him an Oscar nomination as Best Director in 1987). Along with the script, the acting is top-notch - the aforementioned MacLachlan is superb in his role as the college student Jeffrey Beaumont who discovers that the small town he grew up in holds more secrets than he can imagine. Along for the ride is a young Laura Dern (still in her teens) as Sandy Williams, Isabella Rossellini as the singer/seductress Dorothy Vallens, and an over-the-top and excellent performance by Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth (he really must have had fun making this film). All in all, a must-see 8 out of 10. This is a difficult film to watch, with some of the most intense imagery imaginable. Dennis Hopper's Frank is one bad-ass dude, sucking on a whole tank of poppers! Lynch's heavy handed symbolism aside, it is a mystery of the /Hardy Boys/ sort, but plumbs far deeper waters than Fenton's boys ever did.<br/><br/>It is the acting that makes the film, and Dennis is at the top of his form as Frank, the psychotic drug dealer, and Dean Stockwell is outstanding as Ben, his gay, ever so suave, pimp friend. Stockwell's scene lip-synching to Roy Orbison's /In Dreams/ (aka erroneously /Candy Colored Clown/) with a drop-light for a microphone is memorable.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan (Jeffrey) and Laura Dern (Sandy) play two all-American kids with more curiosity than is healthy, caught up in a web of evil beyond their wildest imagination. It /is/ a strange world! <br/><br/>Then there is the beautiful Isabella Rossellini's tragic Dorothy, kept for Frank's twisted, sadistic pleasure, with her husband and little son held hostage. We are never told how long she has endured this horror, but Frank's depravity has rubbed off on her.<br/><br/>A budding romance develops between Jeffrey and Sandy, with Dorothy thrown in to complicate things.<br/><br/>Be prepared for the vilest language endlessly voiced by the foul-mouthed Frank. Every sentence he utters has one or two f--k words -- but this is wholly in character for him! Don't let that put you off viewing this film.<br/><br/>(Laura Dern is my distant cousin!) David Lynch's best film.Astonished me when I first saw it back in 1987,went back to the cinema the very next day,for a second viewing.However as far as I,m concerned it needs to be watched on the big screen.It loses some of it's compelling strangeness and/or power when it's relegated to DVD/video.Perplexed as to why it's not in the top 250 on this board.I WOULD GIVE IT the highest rating.The film is practically flawless.Of course Hopper's performance is the anchor for the movie,but the rest of the cast is also excellent and the Dean Stockwell cameo is worth the price of admission alone.Not for the squeamish (in case you didn't know). I've seen it a dozen times, but when I think of "Blue Velvet" I think of Frank (Dennis Hopper). Then I think of Frederick Elmes' striking, moody photography.<br/><br/>Then I think of Laura Dern's distorted features when she finds Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) stumbling about on her front lawn as Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) is about to get his face rearranged.<br/><br/>Next I think of Dean Stockwell's amazing Ben and Jack Nance's laconic Paul ("I'm Paul").<br/><br/>The fact is, "Blue Velvet" is one incredible film, the cinematic equivalent of a nightmare so fascinating you refuse to interrupt it by waking.<br/><br/>I love the man in the yellow suit (Fred Pickler) and won't ever forget the way he turns to look at Jeffrey at the police station.<br/><br/>Lynch's talent is to create uncomfortable, unforgettable, penetrating moments that linger. He did it brilliantly in "Lost Highway", too, and almost as brilliantly in "Mulholland Drive".<br/><br/>Add Badalamenti's transporting score and you have a classic... I just wish Dern wouldn't do that creepy thing with her chin. It's too scary even for me to take... and I've taken a lot. Seeing Blue Velvet for the first time, after seeing Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead, made me be prepared for the weirdness and strangeness of the movie. Still I felt that something is missing. Unlike Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet rises a lot of questions that remain unanswered which contributes to different interpretations of the movie. After seeing Blue Velvet for the second time I got slightly disappointed because my better comprehension of the movie didn't spill a new light on it. And after all, it appears to me, that like in Mulhollnad Drive, there is no sophistical hidden story beyond the one we see, it's only a simple one, masked beautifully by the director's style. <br/><br/>Seeing Blue Velvet after Mulholland Drive I was inclined to think that major part of the movie was a dream. That is from camera entering into the cut ear till exiting Jeffery's. This possibility was clear enough from the movie itself, though there are some clues that make this assumption more real. <br/><br/>First of all, is the weird people like Ben, Paul and the Blind man in the store. Second is the repetitions. We are shown twice candle light, police - ambulance light. Twice Sandy and Jeffery dine in Arlenes, each time we are shown the restaurant a Trailer passing before it's entrance. Third are the gaps in logic. For instance, Jeffery made some photos with his creative camera but one thing he couldn't do with his camera is to point it on the subjects. Forth is Frank's quoting of Roy Orbison's song In Dreams, 'In dreams I walk with you, In dreams I talk to you...'.<br/><br/>But even in this interpretation, the end is enigmatic. And many questions arise about the connection of the dream scenes to reality. Who really is the pervert? So maybe the whole thing doesn't have a clear plot but a symbolic one of the dark reality and roses like dreams that come in the end ( So maybe the end is a dream and everything else is reality).<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is accompanied with good soundtrack, classic songs and outstanding lead performances. The movie is very memorable and leaves a strong impression.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie, made me realize what a great movie Mulholland Drive is. David Lynch seems to be constantly improving. The cinematography, the plot and the soundtrack from Eraser to Mulholland Drive gets better and better. Blue Velvet (1986)<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern, George Dickerson, Hope Lange, Dean Stockwell, Frances Bay, Brad Dourif, Jack Nance. Directed by David Lynch.<br/><br/>David Lynch's avant-garde American masterpiece that creates atmosphere and tension every time I see it. It is one of those films that you just love more and more, every time you see it. And it is one David Lynch's films that are the easiest to admire and watch. Jeffery Beaumont is a college student returning to his hometown to visit with his mother over the summer, but on the way through a field, he comes across of a human "ear". When he goes to the police about it, he feels like the situation is rather interesting and gets further into details of it. When he realizes that he's gone too far, he is dragged into a scenario involving a night club singer and a psychopath, and their underworld of violence and sex. Lynch is best known for making films with symbolism, eroticism, and pure strangeness in them - this is the film that covers all of those perfectly. It is also arguably the best directed of his whole career. MacLachlan and Rossellini are great in the lead roles, and Hopper and just purely classic for his character. The cinematography is perfect for the darkness found throughout, and also for its beauty. Overall, I would say that this is one of Lynch's best, and definitely one of his more accessible. 5 stars out of 5. The entire film could be summed up in the shot where you get the close up of the insects. It is amazing how people treat their gardens as though they were their living rooms, as though nature does not exist. Similarly, people live their prim and proper lives often not aware of the seething mass that is going on beneath.<br/><br/>A teenager finds a human ear in some waste ground. His curiosity gets the better of him, and he gets sucked into a world that most of us never see, even though many of us know it's there.<br/><br/>One of cinema's finest performances just has to be Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth. Many commentators have described him as evil. I do not think he is evil; I think he is demented. He had a bad childhood, which is why he has to clutch pieces of velvet, why he has to listen to Roy Orbison records to get psyched up. And beneath the veneer of respectable society, the teeming underlife has screwed him up and has made him that way. We must not hate him: we have to pity him.<br/><br/>A superb film.<br/><br/>Incidentally, those who have heard Green Day's version of "My Generation" will hear the band quoting Dennis Hopper's line about Heineken. 'Blue Velvet' was one of the weirdest, creepiest and most original films I ever saw. It's the movie that got me real interested in David Lynch. Before I saw the film, I didn't even really now who this David Lynch guy was. After I viewed the film, I enjoyed it so much I went on a David Lynch rampage, going to the Blockbuster near my house and renting practically everything he did. David Lynch quickly became one of my new favorite filmmakers, after I saw the dark, strange, mystical, and powerful film noir-ish motion picture, 'Blue Velvet'. Although, 'Blue Velvet' isn't Lynch's best work in my opinion, I think it's his most famous work (besides his Twin Peaks television series which lasted from 1990-1991). 'Blue Velvet' is now considered a cult classic, and I have to say, it's probably one of my favorites. I've seen the film about six times, and I own the two-disc special edition DVD.<br/><br/>'Blue Velvet' is set in a small town named Lumberton, a town known best for it's lumber distribution. The story follows a young man named Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who returns to his hometown of Lumberton after being away at college. He stays at his father's farmhouse, and finds a severed ear in the cornfields. Jeffery takes it to the police station, and forensic science identifies it as the ear of of a man named Vallens. This causes Jeffery to investigate Vallens, and his wife, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini), who he thinks to be involved. Jeffery investigates her with the help of a high school senior (who's the daughter of the town's police captain) who Jeffrey is secretly trying to romance, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern). While investigating Jeffrey falls for Dorothy, and gets in the middle of Dorothy's relationship with Frank Boothe (Dennis Hopper), a creepy, perverted, violent mad-man whose kidnapped her husband and son, so that Dorothy will perform perverse sexual acts for him. The film's story then plunges deep into a world of violence, sex, malice, sadism, and nitrous oxide (which Hopper's character, Boothe, is always sucking down while giving a cold and kooky stare to Jeffrey).<br/><br/>'Blue Velvet' isn't a perfect movie by any stretch, but it's a great film that never quits intriguing you for it's whole two hour and five minute runtime. In 'Blue Velvet' the acting is a cut above the rest. Kyle MacLachlan is perfect in his role as the film's hero, Jeffrey. He plays his character with an interesting sense of cool and quick-wittedness, that it is hard for me to imagine anybody being able to do the role but MacLachlan. Isabella Rosellini is fantastic as the aberrant and complex Dorothy, a performance so fine it should have earned her an Academy Award Nomination for Best Lead Actress. Laura Dern is very good as usual, and Quantum Leap's Dean Stockwell have a short but extremely memorable role as Ben (who in the middle of the film lip-syncs a duet of 'In Dreams' with Hopper's character -- a scene that is probably the strangest of the film.) The stand-out scene-stealer of the film is the villain though -- Dennis Hopper as Frank Boothe. Hopper, who gives perhaps the best performance of his career so far, is so absolutely astonishing in his role as the sexual deviant psychopath who is Frank Boothe. Dennis Hopper should not have only gotten an Academy Award nomination for his role, but the actual Oscar itself. Hopper's performance is one of the few screen performances that will be talked about and praised for several years to come. David Lynch provides a once in a lifetime script, and his direction is so fabulous it earned him an Oscar nomination. For all the extraordinary qualities 'Blue Velvet' possesses, it has some bad ones. The film doesn't really add up in the end, and there's a lot of interesting scenarios that are never fully explained or even breached upon. Sometimes you wonder if Lynch is just putting this stuff in his movie to be weird, instead of it serving a higher purpose. That's extremely frustrating to watch, but when all is said and done, 'Blue Velvet's' positive aspects outweigh 'Blue Velvet's' negative aspects by a substantial amount.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I highly recommend renting or buying this bizarre cult favorite. 'Blue Velvet' is a very inventive film, and it never borrows from other ones. It's a movie I'd predict is studied in film classes across the globe, because the film is so complex you won't get everything or catch everything Lynch's 'Blue Velvet' has to offer the first time around. It's a film buff's kind of flick, and that's a huge compliment. Grade: B+<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #199 There are great films. I think that Psycho is a great film, i think that Fear and Loathing is a great film, similarly Being There, The Godfather, Rear Window. There are few occasions when you watch a film and realise what you are watching is'nt just great, it is momentous. It is though you have been born privileged, you've died and gone to Windsor. Shocking films, i believe, can often have this effect. Perhaps it is my age, but the horror and crookedness of such films make them momentous moments, like watching Alien as a twelve year old. Blue Velvet is much more than this. It is a film-and i apologise for the cliché-you can watch again and again. I have never seen any other David Lynch films, to be brutally honest i have not watched many films really. What he has created is so incredible, you can try and dissect it like a classic novel and work out why he did this there and what the lighting is for here. It uses the medium of film as it should be, it is not a play on a flat screen, it is just genius (i apologise yet again for my bad writing). People who won't like this film, i believe, are those people who don't understand films, or those people who think they know so much about films that they ridicule it as being obscure for obscure's sake. There are messages behind it but i can not be bothered to list my opinions of what they might be here. As a spectacle, as a film, Blue Velvet is the most exceptional film i have ever seen. The colour of it, the lighting, the voices, the music, the ending.... And it's got that fella from Quantum Leap singing into a stage light, brilliant! I have just seen the movie again properly for the first time in many years.<br/><br/>I find it a rich and fascinating enigma which is also darkly comic. As for example in the running gag about Heineken, which somewhat presages the McLachlan characters obsession with coffee in Twin Peaks. <br/><br/>I do not accept that it depicts a simplistic duality of good and evil. Frank may be a villain, but he is also clearly a victim of something alluded to in the terms of his frenetic perversions. Evidently, blue velvet had some part to play in a deeply scarring infant experience which he cannot escape. On the other hand, the McLachlan character is innocent only in so far as he is callow, ignorant of the ways of the world. He is also perverse, at the very least to the extent of criminal scopophilliac tendencies, breaking into a woman's apartment to spy on her. Hence the moment in the car when Frank says to him "You're like me!" One feels almost that the boy could turn out to be a younger version of Frank.<br/><br/>Curiously, I find Frank both pungently reminiscent of repellent thugs that I have known and yet also strangely compelling. We feel that we might find his company more tolerable than that of the vanilla youth. In fact, I once knew a man who used to inhale refrigerator gas for kicks. The comparison between him and Booth, who he otherwise did not at all resemble, became a shared joke. Incidentally, we see a lot of glamourised villains in the movies. Franks droogs however are among the most believable low-life scumbags I have seen in a film<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it is not at all clear that the woman really is a victim and not participating in a mutually perverse abusive relationship. Something we are allowed to feel by the fact that her husband and child are almost completely omitted from depiction. <br/><br/>The film is certainly made in a way that will be challenging for many viewers. Partly because it seems at first so nearly conventional and yet soon becomes utterly weird. It is best viewed after watching Eraserhead. Compared to that, Lynch's first film, the style of Blue Velvet seems remarkably conventional. Until the weirdness kicks in. Some of the details, such as the never explained incident which puts the boys father in hospital are actually very like episodes in the earlier film. As is the intermittent thrumming noise with a shot of a guttering candle. This technique recurs in the later Dune, in which a musical motif by Brian Eno recurs with a shot of an opening hand. It serves to bring us back to the abstract surface of the movie as an artifice. Contradicting the simplistic narrative tendency of most films. Other visual-art aspects of Blue Velvet include the incidental static tableuax's which were at the time of its release compared to Ed Kienholz sculptures: the fat man with a tiny dog standing in the street and the scene in the woman's apartment with the zombie-like half-dead "Yellowman".<br/><br/>The art-performance like artificiality is also maintained by the choices of colours, set decor, furniture, etc. Plus, it seems to be set in a kind of timeless never-when, neither in the past nor the present. Above all else, McLachlan and Dern were at the time obviously much older than the characters that they depict. Which I have always thought of as surely deliberate on Lynch's part. It reminds me of all those productions of Romeo and Juliet in which teenagers were played by adults.<br/><br/>I recommend the film but caution that some scenes and the themes it examines may be disturbing for some people. The Blue Velvet marks David Lynch's first apex in his film-making career and sets the right course for his later success to come. For the first time, Lynch creates a world with a dual structure, a peaceful surface of an American small town and an underground crime scene behind it, which would become the director's trademark in his more recent masterpieces such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. In addition, hairstyles, clothes, and daily commodities like phones and cars, are a mish-mash of various eras from the 50s to the 80s, producing senses of timeless and confusion; this would also become Lynch's distinctive signature in the future. Casting is great--relatively unknown Isabella Rossellini, Laura Dern, and Kyle MacLachlan from Lynch's previous film Dune are perfect for their roles, while veteran Dennis Hopper offers one of his best performances as a violent drag addict. So you thought Dennis Hopper was a bad a** and you were right.  The incredible psychopath in this movie scared the hell out of me.  I was waiting for the male lead to lose his ear.  I always heard this was a weird movie, over the top.  This is a movie that takes the angle from the mystery investigator.  But make no bones about it folks, this is not Nancy Drew and people are losing their ears.  For all those people who hate Hollywood for making killers/drug dealers look glamorous you have a movie that shows you the twisted being of a killer/drug dealer.  I really wasn't sure what was going to happen in the end.  Would everybody die, would nobody die, was the investigator/father the villain?  This movie has a wonderful ending and shows you it's not nice to mess around with drug dealers. Blue Velvet is certainly not an 'optimistic' film -- much of the film is a dream - a fabrication.<br/><br/>Lynch is very fond of presenting two separate worlds in each of his movies. One world is the 'dark' world, which represents reality. The other is the 'light' world, which represents a dream. In Blue Velvet, the dream world is a fabrication dreamed up by the entire community of Lumberton. In other films, such as Mulholland Drive for example, the dream world is the delusion of just one person.<br/><br/>The dream world in Blue Velvet is characteristically 'improbable'. Its innocence, and its blind optimism, are almost too much for us to believe, and at times are embarassingly naive. The opening shots of red fire engines, yellow tulips and blue skies are trite, and present an impossibly clean, innocent world. Sandy's speech about her dream and the accompanying diegetic organ music is bizarrely improbable; the situation is almost child-like in its denial of reality and positive outlook on life. The final and most complete improbability is the robin--it looks as fake as the dream world 'feels'.<br/><br/>In reality, the world of Frank and of violence, corruption, excitement and arousal continue to exist despite the end of Frank himself; it was purely by chance that Jeffrey even uncovered this world. There are countless other Franks and countless other things that are bizarre.<br/><br/>* Spoilers *<br/><br/>The ending of Blue Velvet serves not to restore peace to the world, or to reassure us that the world is once again an ideal, perfect place to live. Instead, its hackneyed dialogue and embarrassing naivity and cuteness remind us of the repression that the people of Lumberton are taking part in; they are once more in denial of the uncomfortable feelings, the violence, the sex that occurs in secret all of the time. Jeffrey himself is too uncomfortable with his feelings for Dorothy that he represses them, and lives a dream life with his improbably innocent and child-like Sandy.<br/><br/>I see Blue Velvet as a celebration of uncertainly and of the bizarre. David Lynch expertly forces us to take part in emotions that make us uncomfortable. In watching Blue Velvet, we feel uncomfortable at the sexual desire we feel toward Dorothy. We feel uncomfortable when we enjoy watching the antics of Frank or Ben. Lynch also forces us to consider uncomfortable thoughts using ambiguity: we wonder if the yellow man really is dead. Is he dead? It is a very unpleasant thought, and one we really would rather repress. We wonder if Jeffrey really did want to hit Dorothy. He did, but he would rather not admit it to himself. We wonder if Frank really loves Dorothy. He does, but it's not something we are comfortable with, because we see that Frank is very violent to her. Lynch plays with our disbelief. Are those firemen waving to us because they're happy, or are they pretending to be happy because they would rather not think uncomfortable thoughts. Does the robin look fake because Jeffrey and Sandy's happy life together is ultimately a false reality? The world cannot possibly be full of love for ever more--we know that there are still unpleasant things in the world.<br/><br/>Very interesting. Made in the mid 80's, but styled to be watched for generations. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is a powerful and shocking mystery-cum-drama, that never really lets you know where it's going, or where it might end up.<br/><br/>A small town youth (Kyle MacLachlan)gets a sniff of mystery and excitement, and throws himself fearlessly into the pursuit of knowledge and investigation. Here he enters a world of sex, drugs, and 50's rock and roll, inhabited by a troubled, disturbed mother (Isabella Rossellini), and psychotic gangster Frank Booth(Dennis Hopper). The viewer joins the chase and buckles under the suspense of the action. Grapples with the conflict between purity and good living vs pure evil and really good living (in Booth's world). And then, as natural as can be, we are shown the normality of it all... well, sort of!!<br/><br/>It's a movie to watch more than once. Admittedly, because the first viewing leaves more questions than answers. But, in todays movie world, what could be better than that?? All the main characters are superb, Hopper specifically makes the unbelievable, very believable indeed! Be prepared for bad language and shocking, maybe disturbing, scenes, this film deserves its 18 rating. When this film was first released (in 1986,) its stylistic oddities labeled it a fascinating, yet `weirdo' experimental effort. I remember discussing it with fellow young `yuppies' at the time.  However, with all of Hollywood's carefully calculated and gratuitous cinematic perversities ever since, `Blue Velvet' now plays as a virtual Norman Rockwell celebration of American family values.<br/><br/>In retrospect, `Blue Velvet' is a brilliant achievement. I rate it in my top twenty films of all time. Now I just have to digest `Mulholland Dr.', and bridge the gap. The use of classic and powerfully evocative Roy Orbison music in both films mines deeply the root of the American psyche. Definitely Lynch's best.  This is a "must see" for fans of cult classics. Very dark and grimy, and the cast was incredible. The character of Frank was the embodiment of pure evil. But the music is what tops it off - it will haunt you for days after you watch it. The tag-line of Blue Velvet is "it's a strange world" and that pretty much sums up the movie. It is indeed a strange strange world in the perimeters of this-of all David Lynch's movies. This was the first Lycnh film I ever saw-saw it in the theaters and walked out not knowing what to think.<br/><br/>I should say I am neither a Lynch fan or not a Lynch fan. I would define myself as a curios film-goer with the POTENTIAL to become a major Lynch fan.I have seen some-not all of his films(I have yet to view what many consider one of the best films of all time-Mulholland Drive)-and have the same opinion of all of them-which is after many years of viewing I still have no idea if I like them or not. Yet while viewing, I can't look away.On the negative side, the practical side of me hates to see a film without understanding it at the end. I invest my time watching and I want to know, at the end, that I have some grasp on the overall concept of what I just viewed. On the PLUS side however,is the emotional side which loves to figure out a puzzle and loves the surreal dreamlike atmosphere that is always prevalent in his films.If, all these years after first viewing a Lynch film the powerful images have stayed in my head, I guess I maybe on my way. <br/><br/>I would recommend Blue Velvet as a good FIRST Lynch film to see because it makes more sense then some of his others and the acting is incredible. Mystical haunting imagery and fascinating characters. The darkness and decadence of ordinary people brought to life.I think a certain level of maturity is had by any major Lynch fan and that is patience-you need it to even begin to understand what you are watching. I took an entire class on horror films, and this bizarre film noir by David Lynch (the first Lynch film I've ever seen) is the first movie in a LONG time to leave me shaking.  I can't quite put my finger on what about it left me in that state, whether it be the dangerous and psychotic personality of Frank Bloom, the obvious psychological damage done to poor Dorothy Vallen, or the extent to which the suburban innocents of Lumberton is disturbed by the mystery.  The film is VERY well-made, making great use of noir iconography (notice Sandy's pink and paisley dresses in comparison to Jeffery and the others' dark clothing), awesome set designs, and a deftly-written mystery screenplay.  This has only whetted my appetite for Lynch's other works. This movie is great. it's oddball but has purpose. it's a modern day brother's grimm faerytale, and has all the sarcastic trappings one might expect from that description.<br/><br/>the performances are all great, including a bizarre turn by Dean Stockwell as the suave thug Ben. It's sexy, and exciting, and spooky in both very subtle and jarringly blunt ways. It even works as social commentary for those of you who need an excuse to like strange films. Go! See it! Stop READING! Blue Velvet is a must-see for any aspiring Lynch aficianado.  Its a typically barmy, sexy, sleazy, violent and beautifully surreal piece of work.  The first half is genuinely engrossing, almost playing like a good old-time mystery caper (Lynch once referred to Blue Velvet as "The Hardy Boys gone to hell") before descending violently and unmercilessly into a twisted, nightmarish world populated by the demented Frankie (played by a maniacal Dennis Hopper) and his freakish cohorts.  Its utterly compelling on video, but after recently having the opportunity to see it on the big screen I can't reccomend you see it any other way. The way Jeffrey falls for Dorothy Valens is straight out of a love story. Of course if you put aside the fact that he broke in her apartment and watched her get degraded by that wild crazy guy Frank Booth.  As a young man, he just wanted to take care of her, treat her like a woman deserves. So began his journey into the belly of filth.  <br/><br/>My favorite part is when Jeffrey and Frank first meet.  Frank takes him on the infamous joyride.  First to Ben's place, played outstandingly by Dean Stockwell, where he actually gets his biggest break in this world he had delved himself into.  Then when he finally stands up to Frank, to protect this woman he has put so much of himself into.  When the girl gets up on the hood and starts dancing to the wonderful song, it's a great moment. <br/><br/>
Jeffrey did not know what he wanted as far as Sandy was concerned.  She was his only real friend, but he was also a horny young man.  He had trouble deciding which girl he should be with.  David Lynch does an awesome job, as only he can.  8/10 Beyond R rated, Rossellini credible. Dennis Hopper is scary. All four main actors brilliantly played. The movie is so disturbing in contrasting suburban idyllic live with body parts and killings that the movie may not be suitable for many adults. This is the film that got me to watch all of those other Dennis Hopper films. Not for the timid. . . Kind of disturbing. I don't think I'd bring a date to see this one.  But do bring along your oxygen masks. This is a truly unpleasant film in so many ways and yet it does have a certain quality to it. The cult status it's aquired is a little in excess of what it really deserves. But it is a good movie - if you have a strong enough stomach to last the course! One english writer was quoted as saying Blue Velvet was "the movie of the 80s" but if he truly thought that he can't have watched too many movies from that decade. It's good in many ways but not as good as many would have us believe. The style seems to draw heavily on film noir and French new wave while there are also heavy echoes of Michael Powell's shocker PEEPING TOM in the voyeurism of the leading character and the compulsive nature of his actions. The dialogue has a slightly stiff edge and some of the editing isn't. perhaps as slick as it might be. In the TV showing I caught recently the colour was very dull and drained - I'm not sure if this was from the original photography or simply the ravages of time on this particular print.<br/><br/> If what the actors say is not always that creditble, the acting itself is excellent, from Laura Dern's girl next door  to Dennis Hopper's maniac gangster. Isabella Rossolini can't sing enough to carry the night club scenes (maybe that was the intention) but she does well as a woman on the very edge of insanity later in the story.Kyle MacLachlan is actually superb as the lead although he seems to have been overlooked by history. Everyone recalls Hopper's carpet-chewing and Rossolini's off-key crooning but poor old Kyle is the core of this movie and nobody remembers him.He was the ordinary Joe in the midst of all this madness and maybe his role was such that it inevitabley vanished beneath the excesses of those around him? Generally this is a brutal and nightmarish movie which has a tough reputation to live up to. In my opinion it doesn't quite match up, although it's a close run thing. At the risk of blubbering on about the virtues of "Blue Velvet" and rehashing feelings and plot details that've probably been revealed by other reviewers, I'll say this:  the tricky juxtaposition of a 1950s, Republican-voting town (Lumberton, USA) with scenes of unsettling violence and sexual malaise works quite well (although at times there is a frustrating imbalance between seriousness and sick humor).  Isabella Rossellini creates a memorably tragic character with many layers.  And Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth is up there with Hannibal Lecter as far as great cinematic manifestations of evil are concerned.  While I'm not a gung-ho sycophant ready to kneel at The Altar of Lynch (I think he's a good director, but not God), "Blue Velvet" is an entrancing, hypnotic film that packs a fearsome emotional charge.  (As a side note, the recent DVD special edition is fantastic--the audio and visual remaster and widescreen format make it seem like an entirely new film, especially after viewing pan-and-scanned VHS versions.  It'll give you a new appreciation of Lynch's attention to detail.)<br/><br/>8/10 Blue Velvet is a bizarre but interesting look at the underside of small-town USA.  With an excellent, haunting score, the film manages to sustain a high degree of suspense for the majority of the film.  Jeffrey is a good protagonist, probing into the mystery of Lumberton in a compelling and exciting manner.  Frank is one of my top five villains, Dennis Hopper playing a perfect (almost too perfect!) psychopath that is guaranteed to make you shiver.  The cinematography is excellent, with cuts that leave you simultaneously fearful and curious.  Many bizarre situations (and flashbacks to these situations) set a mood which forces you to wonder if there's a grotesque force undermining your town. [8/10] ...didn't appear on camera and tried to stay out of the movie.  I refer, of course, to Roy Orbison.  His beautiful voice - no lesser critic than Elvis called it the best in pop music - could convey loss and heartbreak like no other.  In the brothel scene the song "In Dreams" is heard by the viewer at the same time the confusing images of lust (the hookers dancing) and brutality (Jeffrey getting beaten)and are on the screen.  The sense of horrifying disorientation becomes complete.   Without Roy the movie would have been considerably less. I love this film.  It is insanely unique.  I have only two dislikes -<br/><br/>Dorothy's wig - quite 80's and overdone, and the very drawn out,<br/><br/>pad-driven song that comes on when Jeffrey and his the William's<br/><br/>daughter are dancing. Otherwise, Dennis Hopper is sadistic and marvelous.  He really<br/><br/>worked hard on this character, making him interesting.  Dennis<br/><br/>certainly seems to believe that he is the character of Frank Booth. <br/><br/>Jeffrey is entertaining and well cast, Isabella does wonderfully as<br/><br/>Dorothy, and look out for Ben - the scene at his pad is extremely<br/><br/>memorable. Badalamenti's score is a great ancestor to his for Mulholland<br/><br/>Drive.  And the retro/small town nature of this film overshadows it's<br/><br/>Eighties time setting.  That's a good thing.  David Lynch's directing<br/><br/>is perfect, and the locations are so well done.  Way better than<br/><br/>Lost Highway, which took on a 90's feel. 10/10 stars, a definite rent, and buy the Special Edition DVD if you<br/><br/>really like it.  It is well stuffed - and it showcases the colors and<br/><br/>cinematography with a great widescreen transfer... This is a good one from Lynch. It's told in a pretty standard format unlike some other Lynch movies. The story works and gets you interested in it. The situations are WEIRD and intriguing. The symbolism and imagery have meaning. The symbolism is clever & powerful, not cheesy. The mood of the film works well. <br/><br/> I give it a 8/10. Very Unique. David Lynch has a habit of exploring sexual deviance in his films, and does it in a graceful, yet haunting way.  <br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan well displays an embrace of darkness; and along with Dennis<br/><br/>Hopper and Isabella Rossellini's performances, this film has top notch acting. at the time this was truly original and amazing maybe not so much now as the idea of a darker side to suburban life has been copied, but this is the original and best if you are a david lynch fan you'll love or you'll love this, but if your a david lynch fan you'll have probably seen this. i think its his best film David Lynch's look at small town America sports some excellent performances, great cinematography, a disturbing story, and fantastic direction.  The only problem with David Lynch is that he is not really all that acessible to everyday audiences, and that is why he will never make a big budget film, or ever win any acadamy awards.  Which is perfectly fine by me.  I think David Lynch is a fantastic and uncompromising filmmaker who even at his worst is better than most Hollywood filmmakers out there.  Dennis Hopper should have recieved some sort of nomination for this film. What else can be said of one of the greatest movies? I'll just try to add to the magic...<br/><br/>A beautifully directed piece of work by David Lynch,possibly his best, Blue Velvet is a look a the ugly underbelly of a seemingly perfect little town. This movie is like a live canvas for Eric Fischl. It's like lifting up a rock on the grass and looking under it. On top it looks smooth and warm, nothing much to it, but underneath it is full of worms and insects, crawling in humid smelly earth. The dark side of suburbia.<br/><br/>Much like Lynch himself, this movie is a polarized setting. On one side you have the extremely goody-goody characters like Jeffrey and Sandy and on the other you have the sick,demented and sadistic Frank and Dorothy. Everything seems to go ok in each world until the meet each other...then things get messy.<br/><br/>Lynch creates a wonderful world of contrasts, light and dark, so pressed against each other that eventually they start to blend. Goofy good-natured scenes like Jeffrey's chicken walk pinned against Frank's demented sexual attack on Dorothy, just blow your mind away and make you uncertain you are watching the same movie. <br/><br/>As always(Dune was not his fault), great directing by Lynch and great performances by the cast members.You'll keep singing Blue Velvet for days...and never think of it in the same way...a 10 out of 10. For a bit of fun, I am going to attempt a review using only text from IMDB's Memorable Quotes from Lynch films - here goes:<br/><br/>See that clock on the wall? In five minutes you are not going to believe what I just told you. I'm in the middle of a mystery and it's all secret. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. What does that mean?<br/><br/>
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. This is where mechanical excellence and one-thousand four-hundred horsepower pays off! I had a dream. I had a dream about this place. In fact, it was on the night I met you.<br/><br/> In the dream, there was our world, and the world was dark because there weren't any robins and the robins represented love. And for the longest time, there was this darkness. And all of a sudden, thousands of robins were set free and they flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it seemed that love would make any difference, and it did. So, I guess it means that there is trouble until the robins come. It's a strange world. This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the sitution, don't you think?  <br/><br/>Well, that's for me to know and you to find out. Well, I don't think much of anything. I like to remember things my own way. A man's attitude... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. You sure you're doing okay? Everything all right? <br/><br/>It's no longer your film. There's something I've been meaning to ask you for some time now. Am I a good man? Or a bad man? Oh no... no... you're a Romeo. Okay, I'm thinking. That ain't no way to treat your wife, buddy. I don't care what she's done. Is that somethin' you agree with? Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Can ya do that for me? Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck.<br/><br/>Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place! It's kind of embarrassing. <br/><br/>It's been a pleasure talking to you. this is not Lynch's best work but, it's close! it's a great movie though...it has the Lynch recipe for success: great actors, great script and the famous LYNCH ZOOMS :). I give it a 9.5 out of 10. P.S. Watch Mulholland Drive too. Originally seen and praised as an exposÃ© of the dark side of "Reaganite" America, BLUE VELVET remains as astounding as ever because, it turns out, there is as much a genuine place in Lynch's heart for small-town firemen and artificially-vivid flowers as there is for Frank Booth and Dorothy Valence's death dance. The first half-hour sort of lulls one into a trance; then Booth arrives on the scene and the movie explodes into one of the most jaw-dropping works of art ever made in the US of A. Melding Hitchcock, Cocteau, Bunuel, the Boy Scouts, and his own formidable subconscious, Lynch created in 1986 a masterwork he wouldn't measure up to for another fifteen years. I almost had to wait another two years when Im 18 before being able to see this. I made the mistake of trying to watch it when tired and I fell asleep, my mom woke up. She came into the living room to read in coordinance with the infamous rape scene. Next morning she told me I couldn't watch it because it will teach me the wrong way to treat women(as if im so manipulative but thats another story). Well the next day after school they went to my sisters basketball games. House was free for 6 hours.<br/><br/>
I cherished those 6 hours especially the two when this piece was playing. The directing is something Im sort of aspiring to now. Into my memory I wrote down every scene. If I ever get into film this will be my biggest influence. This is unusual I never pay so close attention. My thoughts disagreed though this time and Ill remember this as a directing masterpiece.<br/><br/>
The films beginning though was forced into action too fast. When Lynch could have led us to discover certain things. He instead chose to just have it spelled out for us through some dialogue. Specifically, after the boy's first visit to the apartment. He--when telling the inspector's daughter--comes to many assumed conclusions, that sadly were all right. I disliked this way of moving the plot along. <br/><br/>The boy also healed extraordinarily fast and the parents of the young blonde were poorly shapen and without much background, merely set pieces.<br/><br/>9/10 This movie was perfect for the amazing DENNIS HOPPER!  The manner in which he played FRANK BOOTH is so intense.  Frank Booth MADE this movie what it is.  Kyle M and that blond girl from Jurassic Park, Laura Dern were ok. This movie has some great parts, primarily when FRANK takes laughing gas to get his jollies with Isabella Rosalini.  That's a truley DISTURBING scene. I was shocked when KYLE punched FRANK BOOTH in the face!  I thought for sure that KYLE would meet his maker for doing that.  However, FRANK just put on some lipstick and KISSED Kyle a bunch of times and punched him out.  All in all a good movie.  Hard to figure out where it was going at times.  There is some great dialogue.  Dennis Hopper IS Frank Booth!!! I don't know what or when the first film that that was ever made about the dark side of small towns came out but "Blue Velvet" is quiet possibly the best film ever made on this particular topic.  Even the story is relatively straightforward and easy to follow, the imagery, symbolism and characters are mind blowing.  Kyle MacLachlan gives his best performance of all time as Jeffrey Beaumont, a kid who finds a severed ear in a field and it leads him on a dark odyssey in his own hometown.  Dennis Hopper shows why he is one of the best villainous performers of all time as Frank Booth, a sadistic gangster whom Jeffrey encounters in the process of finding the owner of the ear.  With Laura Dern and Isabella Rosellini rounding out the cast of main characters, you have a interesting tale that weaves between the light and the darkness of a small town somewhere in America.  One of the best sequences in the movie involves Jeffrey be taken for a ride with Frank and his cronies.  It shows the darkness and vileness that is the villain and it explains why he only comes out at night.  David Lynch has a way with telling a story.  He draws you into it and he grabs you when you least expect it and doesn't let go until the very end.  With a great cast, great plot, great imagery, and a great setting, "Blue Velvet" is the best movie I have ever seen that shatters the small town stereotypes and mentality to pieces.  I give it a 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>PS:  This is David Lynch's best film! This is my favorite movie of all time. I love the cheesiness of the waving fireman and the red roses against the white picket fence. It all looks so untarnished and pure until Jeffrey Beaumont (phenomenal Kyle MacLachlan) finds a severed ear in a vacant lot behind his neighborhood. He decides, after taking it to the local cop-shop, to do a little investigating of his own after he is told to stay out of it by Det. Williams. Jeffrey is flung head-first into a world of sadomasochism, drug use, and murder. He meets the beautiful lounge singer Dorothy Vallens after hiding in her closet. She catches him, makes him strip and she almost has her way with him until an earthshattering knock at the door. She makes him hide in the closet she found him in and opens the door to her hell. FRANK BOOTH! He's a bad-ass junkie with a penchant for fetish sex and that piece of blue velvet cut from Dorothy's robe. He continues to hit her, sexually abuse her, making her role-play (mommy-baby) while poor Jeffrey is in the closet helpless to her pain. Frank leaves and Jeffrey makes sure Dorothy is okay before leaving with mixed feelings. He's finding out that Frank is a VERY bad person, involved in murder and mayhem. Meanwhile, Jeffrey is getting mighty chummy with Sandy Williams, the detective's daughter yet still goes to Dorothy..... This movie is amazing in so many ways. The choice for Dennis Hopper to play Frank Booth is so perfect. He's a scary character, and that damned oxygen mask he keeps sucking on.... Kyle MacLachlan plays a perfectly naive Jeffrey, he's so darn cute. This movie gets 10 out of ten. It's a strange world...... Modern example of surrealism which actually has a plot and brilliant actors. Chilling and bizarre, Dennis Hopper portrays the drug-hazed psychotic while Isabella Rosselini plays his masochistic girlfriend.  Kyle McLaughlin is the innocent whose curiosity leads him to this dark world of sex and violence. David Lynch's greatest film. Blue Velvet was written and directed by David Lynch in 1986 and despite the commercial failure of Dune, which was his previous film, he was granted infinite artistic freedom during its production. This is remarkable when considering the failure of its predecessor, yet essential when considering the film's subjective, idiosyncratic and consequently curious subject matter. Despite self-assured performances from Kyle MacLachlan as Jeffrey Beaumont, the protagonist, Laura Dern as Sandy, the love interest and Isabella Rossellini as Dorothy Vallens, the femme fetale, it is Dennis Hopper who is truly the lynchpin of Blue Velvet as Frank Booth, the antagonist.<br/><br/>Booth is one of the most extraordinary manifestations of evil ever cinematically envisioned. He is unpredictable, coarse and violent. Nevertheless, he is also one of the most misunderstood romantic characters in contemporary cinema. Booth betrays bizarre moments of tenderness and hurt, which adds great depth to a character that would possibly be two-dimensional in less assured hands. Apparently Hopper clinched the role by informing Lynch: `I am Frank Booth.' A statement that seems truly believable in light of his undeniably brilliant performance as one of cinema's most curious, complex and corrupt characters. However, Blue Velvet is much more than the study of one character. While it is principally a detective story, it also displays themes including oedipal complexes, psychological tensions and a range of strange fixations and neurosis. Consequently it is an excellent combination of narrative and characterization. Blue Velvet did much to restore Lynch's reputation as a highly idiosyncratic director, yet one who could still tap into a well of darkness, perversity and neurosis, which is subconsciously masked by the familiar. It is cinema of the highest order and one of the best avant-garde films to come out of 1980's America. THIS looks like a nice film. It has white picket fences, nice songs, and a young couple in love. Nice one. But it also have Denise Hooper, with oxygen mask, he fright me, very scare. Very darking. And Izebel Rosnini, she crazy, like mad woman, and she make it dark. I remember seeing this WITH friend, and at the beginning, he say it look like nice film, nice one, but when it come dark, it is too shocking, surprise me (and you too, it is sure). So the MOVIE, it is worth it too see just for this, the juxaposting of light and dark is FANTASTIC! It move me. And you too, it is sure. This is a great and peculiar movie. It has some crazy scenes including drugs, violence, sex, and just plain weridness. This is the first time Kyle Maclachlan worked with David Lynch but it was a great performance. This movie also has something most directors don't even bother with: great camera angles. Perhaps this movies finest point is that it has an eerie feeling to it and lets the viewer assume what happened. This is my favorite movie of all time. in its opening sequence, this movie shows us the underlying evil in Anytown, USA via the ants under the surface of a lawn. this was executed by the gradual zooming of the camera from neighborhood-scale to insect-scale. in fact, this zooming technique would be used many more times throughout the film. so much symbolism, so many metaphors. this camera technique in itself suggests that under closer inspection things are not what they seem. the protagonist here, Jeffrey, is the vehicle for this concept. he acts the part of a junior detective whom we follow as he unearths the ugliness beneath his hometown.<br/><br/>David Lynch exudes style. a comment on here astutely pointed out the difference between the scenes set in dark and the ones set in light. two different movies, right down to the acting (in case you are wondering, everything Lynch achieves, no matter how subtle is intentional). Dennis Hopper's Frank is in my opinion the key character here. when he controls a scene he professes "now it is dark."<br/><br/>and so we have the battle between light and dark (guess which is good and which is evil).<br/><br/>i wondered to myself what the purpose of having such cheezy dialogue and metaphors at certain points in the movie was. at first i found it  a bit distracting. then it began to serve its purpose: to further contrast the dark from the light. Frank is a depraved, sadistic lunatic and he never once uses the word 'neat.'<br/><br/>i can't help but measure this against mulholland dr as it is the only other Lynch movie i've seen (check out my comment on that one if you're deciding which of the two to see). Blue Velvet conveys Lynch's style and wit, but it lacks a gimmick to make it great. maybe i don't fully appreciate its intended power (which may have served as the 'gimmick') as i am another desensitized teen.<br/><br/>the film is presented using a lot of contrast. contrast gives clarity and thus Blue Velvet was straight forward, as was most of its symbolism. but even the symbols have multiple interpretations which make this film intriguing.<br/><br/>deliberate, clearly symbolic, possibly shocking<br/><br/>recommended : 7.5/10 Not sure what to say here. I was recently blown away by Lynch's true masterpiece Mulholland Drive. As other reviewers put it, you see it and can't stop thinking about it for weeks. Couldn't be more accurate.<br/><br/>Not so with Blue Velvet. I was looking for a truly complex, intruiging and engaging story - and was extremely disappionted. I've read others' comments and can't begin to understand all of the praise this film has received. After a film like Mulholland Drive, the viewer is left with a fascinating puzzle to unlock. It prompts you to view the film again, think harder, and really consider what Lynch is saying.<br/><br/>Can't say the same is true for Blue Velvet. The only reason I say so far is because I haven't seen the ridiculously unattainable Eraserhead.  I've seen all of David Lynch's other films and the only one that I think comes close to being as good as Blue Velvet is Elephant Man.  Blue Velvet is not a good movie to watch if you cringe at the sound of the f word but if you can stand to hear that word you should see this movie.  I was talking to my friend about Lost Highway and he asked if I had seen Blue Velvet.  Once I said no he just smiled and said rent it. Thank you friend!  This movie is tied for my second favorite with American History X.  Dennis Hopper delivers a very chilling performance as Frank Booth.  His first scene in the movie is very disturbing and brutal to watch.It has some very interesting dialogue and visuals that you won't forget anytime soon.  At first the  town seems so nice but if you scratch the surface you realize that there is much more than what you see.  There is a forced love slave, a drug addicted sadist, a severed ear, and let's just throw in the bugs we see at the beginning.  In other words this is movie hard to explain simply by commenting on it.  The other comments may help you understand it better but it still has to be seen to be believed. 10/10 I'll say this first this is one of three of my favorite films the other two being a clockwork orange and taxi driver.This one is visually great greatly directed and acting pretty tops.Heres a rating of most of the cast. kyle mclachlan7/10..issabella rosselini 8/10.. dennis hopper 10/10..laura dern 6/10..and brad dourif and jack nance7/10 cos they are great actors.Back to dennis hopper his performance would be the best psycho of all time.So definetly a **** out of four.................oh and i forgot dean stockwell 10/10 for his scene stealer singing ''in dreams'' I have to admit, that when I first saw this movie, I left the theater angry and bitter. So much of the film was disturbing and just hard to watch. I had never seen a movie like this. However, when I saw it again years later, I was shocked at how good it really was. I have seen it twenty times since and I am still amazed at how really good it is. The key to appreciating this film, is getting over the shock. I am no David Lynch fan, in fact, this is the only film of his that I actually like. However, the greatness of this film allows me to forgive him for "Lost Highway" and "Wild At Heart." Lynch basically takes an ideal small town setting and shows you the dark reality that resides there. The point of the film is that ugliness and evil really can exist anywhere and manicured lawns and town parades don't make it go away. Look under the surface and see what is down there. Perhaps the most memorable part of this film is the performance of Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. I cannot imagine another actor ever being able to give the performance that Hopper gave. Frank Booth is pure terror. If you are interested in seeing moviemaking at its best, rent this and give it a second or third chance. It will disturb you, but you will soon appreciate the greatness. It seems pretty clear that David Lynch has personal issues, which he's trying to work out with his filmmaking.  So if you rent this video, a classic of sorts, beware:  there's some pretty freaky stuff on this tape.  I mean, some really messed up, bent, twisted stuff, which isn't exactly my daily bread.  Dennis Hopper's performance as a man with infantile sexual issues, who deals with these issues through obsessive-compulsive control of others, is really horrifying.  That being said, here's why I recommend Blue Velvet, to adults. <br/><br/>It's a pretty unvarnished look at the depths of human depravity.  And I hear you wondering, Why would anyone want to see that?  So I'll suggest a reason, which you can take or leave, as you please.  When we're awake and sober, we realize that we're not in complete control of our lives; and, those who exercise ultimate power over us may be mad.  That's the problem Lynch seems obsessed with:  Those in control, who make decisions that affect our lives, are often not people of superior sentiment, or ability.  Our President, for example, has an IQ just over 90;  and, he didn't even win the election. It's really bizarre.  And that's why Blue Velvet is such a truly terrifying movie.  It pushes this common fact of human life, something we all live with,  to the nth degree.  <br/><br/>Imagine that there is some kind of switch in your brain that turns off who you are.  Now imagine that the person with ultimate power over you life is someone you hate, even despise.  I can't imagine a darker pit of hell into which one could fall.  But this is the living hell into which the main characters of Blue Velvet fall.  Like a moral black hole, it sucks even bystanders in by its own dark weight.  It's not pleasant to contemplate. But it is reality.  And it begs the question:  How do we deal with this reality without giving in to the dark side? David Lynch at his best.  This is at once beautiful and disturbing.  An engrossing plot, which much of Lynch's work lacks (or maybe I just don't get 'em.)<br/><br/>Hopper, Rossolini, McLachlan, Stockwell.  All brilliant performances. Should have won the best picture Oscar.<br/><br/>See it.  It's cool. Blue Velvet was notably made in 1986, and yet I've seen it now for the first time in 2001. It is truly amazing, but I am not going to extol it any further; rather focus on the stunning cinema that Lynch delivers.<br/><br/>Lynch composes images and light with precision and skilled handwork. Like for example his visually similar flick "Lost Highway", which was in my opinion created with several points of resemblance to Blue Velvet. Although it has its dissimilarities. And what is so special about the way David Lynch makes his movies? Well, as far as I'm concerned, it is the way he pulls the viewer gradually more and more into the story. And the way he portrays his thoughts and ideas. Angles, lights, scenery, music etc. All put forth in this spellbinding cinema. Twisted together, but in order. I dare to call it compelling and evocative.  <br/><br/>Of course this has to be experienced, and not dwelled about in an IMDb review. It is pretty obvious. See this movie. Let David Lynch welcome you to his cave of cinema.<br/><br/>(9/10) I've seen Dennis Hopper playing as bad guy in a lot of films, but it all was nothing, compared to this one. The screenplay of movie is somewhat meaningless, it looks like David Lynch just wanted to show how insane can be some people, and, guess what, he did it! Harrowing David Lynch tale of an ordinary young man, Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlyn) who makes the unsettling discovery of finding a seared off human ear and uses it as the sole link that leads to a warped nightclub singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini) and her moody and gas-inhaling captor, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).  A few scenes did insult me here and there.  The performances here and the story (written by Lynch himself) are both okay, but the technical parts of the film - the musical score, the cinematography, the production design, and the editing are flawless and should have earned Oscar nominations.  "Blue Velvet" may not be Lynch's best film, but it's an intriguing and flat-out startling film-noir. Blue Velvet is a complicated and a mesmerizing film. The viewer is  shocked by the violence portrayed in the film, which is filled with remarkable performances, most notably from Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. The film has lots of symbolism and psychological references to the dark side of the mind. This would be a definite masterpiece, but the film has a couple of campy scenes that let down the atmosphere and the ending is forced-like and doesn't do justice to a film this original. Frank Booth is the scariest man ever to appear on the screen. Blue Velvet is placed around 1962. There is a parallel and evil world all around us that is not immediately perceived. The story of drugs,police corruption,sexual deviance and curiosity is a reminder of seeing that world in 1962-63. Not that it has gone away but that I found myself in it and it is manifest in Blue Velvet. A great and clever movie...and don't go down by Lincoln again! Deep River Apartments is there. Blue Velvet is one of my all-time favorites films and one that I have seen countless times. It is a very unique, stylized cinematic masterpiece. David Lynch aced every part of this movie-the cinematography, lighting, sound, music, all combined are fantastic. The acting for the most part is also great-I wish Kyle MacLachlan would of added a little more depth to this character being that he is the lead, but it's not a big deal. Dennis Hopper will make you squirm uncomfortably with his scary, powerful portrayal. Isabella Rosselini puts a lot of "town weirdo" anguish and bizareness into her role that is very effective. The ending is a little hokey, I feel David Lynch could of made it fit more the dark style of the film, but that is the only complaint I have of the film overall. This film is extremely intense and dark, and I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the stomach for such films. You have to be open-minded to enjoy this film. This couldn't be the most famous director of all time, but we find in his filmography, movies like Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, A Straight Story and the cult series Twin Peaks. But this Blue Velvet has more to offer that any of his other movies has. A perfect story, a beautiful photography, and above all, an extremely great direction by Lynch. And if that initial and final sequences can hide the horrors and violence of the inside picture, the quality remains with it, from the start to the very end. That's a fact. 10/10 Okay this is not a movie for the faint of heart.  I'm extremely frightened of both, David Lynch and Dennis Hopper now. This is disturbing, creepy, scary, depressing, comment on life.  Seeing this movie is like having someone beat u unconcious, it's painful.  But, if u want great acting, and an intricut plot see this film.  I give it a B- Lynch is at his peak (so far) in this one. The symbolism, the *extremely* intelligent use of clichés, acting, and masterful direction of all these aspects and more all further the plot: they are not done just to show off style for artistic effect. Too much to mention. My few words here won't do justice to this masterpiece of film. Astonishing. Acting. Superb. Story telling at its absolute apex. Lynch uses the story as a lens moving in and out of focus of the American mythical small town - when the lens is blurry we get the clichéd dialog and characters of small town America looking and saying precisely what we expect, when the lens moves in tight we get thrills, perfect acting, direction, and haunting scenes that stay with you. If you don't care for the raw violence and sex the first time round, give yourself some time and watch again. They are not gratuitous and are essential to the delicate balance of the film. And in the end the film the good guys win. What more can you want?<br/><br/>Simply first-rate film making from a first rate cast and crew. what would draw me to see this very unusual film. was it the music ? maybe. the chance to see isabella rossellini nude . no but it would help.was it the chance to see a great mordern classic.dang right. the film tells a tale of a small town where a young man comes home to visit his ill father at the hospital. as he walks home he sees a ear in a field and takes it to a friend of the family at the police station.when he gets a call about the ear he isn't told much but his daughter does. they learn it has to with a lounge singer who's husband and kid his being held for ransom.when he inspects her apartment he sees frank a drug dealing sadist ( only dennis hopper could play him so good) who allong with a partner is selling drugs out of a building. the film is unusual but , aren't david lynches films weird. most scenes in this film are parrodized of coppied ( warren beatty tried to copy issabella rosselini singing  with madonna)  if you love a good film see blue velvet.( three cheers for david lynch ) Blue Velvet is an incredible triumph in filmmaking!  What looks like a small midwestern town, when looked at more deeply, is actually a rat's nest of seething hatred and mysoginy.  Dennis Hopper is seriously demented as Frank Booth, a man you would not want to run into in a dark alley at night!  You can look at this place with all the disdain you want until you realize; How is this town any different from my own?  This town has a high school, a diner, industry, and families.  Also, it has a group of sadistic palookas whose idea of playfully teasing their women is to perform all sorts of unspeakable acts of sado-masochism.  Your town may have a nicer downtown section than this one does, but it still is not as squeaky clean as you might think it is.  Take a closer look, and you might see hell bubbling over and flooding your streets.  Thank you, David Lynch, for making me gasp with horror at suburban life, yet again. Rating: 10/10 (This town does look inviting!) "Blue Velvet" is Lynch at his height.  His need for the weird does not overwhelm his storytelling as in his later films ("Lost Highway," the most egregious offender).  And he actually has a coherent plot that makes several points and develops several themes. "Twin Peaks" comes closest to capturing the same feeling, but unfortunately the show fell apart during its second season and fell into the oddity for oddity's sake trap. A finer analysis of what lurks under the surface of anyone in any town you will not find. Lynch, Hopper, Orbison, all of them, and more blend into an exciting stew that  chills me  each time I see it. This film can excite, disturb, amaze, and confound you. Each time I see it I find a different nuance. If you like to be thrilled and shocked, do yourself a favor and rent Blue Velvet. Blue Velvet is the sick and twisted story of a young man conducting an investigation into an ear he found in a field.  He unknowingly enters the world of Frank Booth.  Lynch's disturbing tale is without a doubt one of his best flicks and probably the most strange movie ever (next to Lost Highway). Great performances all around, in particularly Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth.  Hopper gives one of the best performances of all time as the drug addled murdering madman.  Lynch creates a world of beauty and horror that leaves the viewer disturbed and strangely intrigued.  An unforgettable flick, but not for everyone.  Check it out!!!! Blue Velvet is certainly a masterpiece worth seeing from the outstanding and offbeat directing genius, David Lynch.  The imagery used in the film could only come from the mind of Lynch, with plenty of symbolism lying within the primary colors.  In almost every scene, one can find red, blue, yellow and green.  Look out for other references to color and their meanings.  Laura Dern symbolizes young, innocent beauty with her platinum blonde hair and white or pink outfits.  Isabella Rosselini, an older, tarnished mother and wife who is emotionally scarred is quite a contrast-- black hair, black and blue outfits...  the black and blue also reflect her battered status.  He who steals the show is none other than the great Dennis Hopper, portraying the disturbed, eternally angry Frank Booth.  This film attests to Hopper's abilities as an actor.  Hats off to Dean Stockwell, who plays Booth's gay pimp friend, Ben.  The scene at Ben's house brings out the best in both Hopper and Stockwell and is certainly one of the most legendary, brilliant and hilarious scenes in cinema history.  Here's to Ben! I'm a huge fan of David Lynch's work.  Truly one of the modern American film auteurs, each film Lynch does is unique, yet is always distinctly his. If I recall correctly, Blue Velvet was the first David Lynch movie I saw, and it's always been my favorite.  The film was so vastly different superficially than his previous two films, Dune and The Elephant Man, and strongly hinted where he would go next, with Twin Peaks.  Blue Velvet is very similar to Twin Peaks (among other things, Lumberton and Twin Peaks are both very similar places, with a sharp contrast of light and dark/good and evil).  <br/><br/>The actors in Blue Velvet filled their roles perfectly. Laura Dern and Kyle MacLachlan may come off as being hokey, but they're playing the part of two, hokey suburban teens, oblivous to the dark side of the world.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Frank Booth is easily one of the most frightening performances I've ever seen.  Another review also mentioned Isabella Rossalini's character being unnerving in her final scene.  I agree, but her one scene that was really frightening was when she showed up at the house, naked, approaching Jeffrey.  And of course, Dean Stockwell sent shivers down my spine, and has forever cursed me when I hear Roy Orbison's "In Dreams."<br/><br/>One of the great things about the film is it's ending.  While in a sense, there is closure to the central conflict of the film, there is also an uneasy open-ended feeling to it.  The specific figure of evil has been defeated, but now that the underlying evil of Lumberton has been exposed, how could anyone really live comfortably?  <br/><br/>Not only is Blue Velvet my favorite David Lynch film, but, bold as it may be to say, I think it's my favorite film of all time. Ah, what can be said about Blue Velvet that hasn't already been said? Lynch is a master of the bizarre, and this movie is certainly that. It's great on so many levels. The scene involving Ben, for example, is great. I nearly died laughing. Frank's over the top behavior is the best part of this movie. The "loveletter" speech, for example...brilliant. The two movies that I would compare this one to the most are American Beauty and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Most people can see the former, I'm sure, (what really lies beneath the perfect white fences) but not many people would get the RHPS connection, I don't expect. Watch as Jeffrey (Brad) and Sandy (Janet) are taken out of their perfect little environment and put into this totally strange and dehumanizing situation with Frank (Frank) as the ring-master to it all. When it's all over and Frank-as-Frank is dead, Jeffrey-as-Brad and Sandy-as-Janet slowly recover, but are still jaded by the whole thing. Maybe it's a bad analogy, but oh well. I think it fits. 10/10. BLUE VELVET (1986)-- Grade: A+<br/><br/>WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>"It's a strange world"... And this is a strange film... But BLUE VELVET, at first sight only a suspense from the mid eighties, is also one of the most intriguing, haunting, brilliant and disturbing films of the last twenty years.<br/><br/>The film begins quietly. In the best style that PLEASANTVILLE would use twelve years after, the camera shows white picket fences, red flowers, blonde kids crossing the street, the milk deliverer waving, the family having coffee and... an old man having a heart attack while watering the plants of his backyard. He falls on the grass, a dog comes and drinks some water from the hose and then the camera takes you under the ground and some black ants are shown. This was one of the most famous and acclaimed scenes of the '80s because of the brilliant use of symbolism, that will be better understood as the story goes on. But there's much more to come, including another thing that became famous about the film: a human ear lying on a field. The ear is found by Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle McLachlan), the son of that old man from the first scene. He shows the ear to a police detective, whose daughter Sandy (Laura Dern) also becomes interested in the case. They become obsessed about that, especially Jeffrey, who starts to investigate the life of a night club singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who may be involved in the intrigue. One night he hides at her closet and watches an unforgettable (in a very, very bad way) scene. From then on, he will discover the dark side not only of Lumberton, but also of a life indeed.<br/><br/>David Lynch received a very well deserved Oscar nomination for best direction. More than anything, he has courage to head such an audacious project. BLUE VELVET is one of the best films of the '80s and one of the most shocking and brilliant pictures I've ever seen. Lynch wants to show many things, but mainly this is a story about the thin line between the light and the dark. That's where Rossellini's character stays. Her husband and son were kidnapped by Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper)- a mean, disturbed, totally mad and psychotic guy, that would let Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter both ashamed. Now he uses her, a great singer and once a good housewife, as a sexual object for sado-masochism and the weirdest sex fantasies you can imagine, using intense violence. Somehow, she seems to like that, but at the same time suffers- I don't know how to explain. When Dorothy gets involved with Jeffrey, she begs him to beat her, but also says that she got his disease. BLUE VELVET is a film that defies explanations. Somehow, you know what it wants to say, but it is so complex and intense that you don't know how to write it. It is about facade, about what lies beneath a picture-perfect city, but it is about much more. There's a lot of symbolic things (the insects, the candle, the bird in the end, the city indeed), and each of them has its meaning. As you can see, there's much more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see the contrast between the light, sunny world and the dark, obscure one- co-existing, side by side. It seems that David Lynch builds two different films. In the light world, everything looks like a sitcom. It's even intentionally pathetic. In the dark world, we have things that get more and more shocking during the story, but also intentionally. Sometimes, some elements come from the dark to the light, or vice-versa, with some dark humor elements (as the prostitute dancing on the car while Frank tortures Jeffrey). And then there's the ending, coming back to the sitcom world. However, in the last scene, with Dorothy and her son, you can hear a part of the song "Blue Velvet" that was not heard before, something saying that you always remember of the dark things. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is also courageous. Everyone is worthy of recognition: Kyle McLachlan is in the best role of his career (that includes SHOWGIRLS), Laura Dern does an excellent job as the pure girl, Dennis Hopper doesn't let his character turn into a clown (the role is over-the-top, so the performance must be intentionally over-the-top) and Isabella Rossellini is the best of all. Very few actresses would be brave enough to play such an intense character, who suffers all kinds of dirty things and even like some of them. A perfect performance that would make her mother (Ingrid Bergman) proud- and shocked.<br/><br/>With some of the most impacting scenes of the modern cinema, BLUE VELVET is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, but not the same kind of masterpiece as CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE. It's unquestionably not-for-everyone. There is plenty of weird sex scenes, nasty language and graphic torture. But it is obligatory for everyone seriously interested in cinema, proving that David Lynch is one of the best directors of our time. It is unique, provoking, audacious, shocking, haunting, unforgettable- and much more. This is one of my fave rave films of all time.  Its probably in my top five list of greatest films ever made.  I saw this in my teens after driving in my copper 1967 Mustang back in 1986 and hearing a radio advertisement about it on the radio.  The voice over lady said critics were saying about Blue Velvet "you've never seen anything like it before".  And they were right...<br/><br/>
This has some of the most beautiful and surprisingly simple images I have ever seen.  The skillful way you aren't sure at first if the film is set in the 1980's or the 1950's, the way we see images of bugs at the beginning and Jeffrey later disguises himself as "the bugman" or bug exterminator to find out more about a mysterious woman in his hometown of Lumberton, USA.  And the way the villian's name is Booth and the mysterious woman lives on Lincoln street.  The main character's last name is Beaumont as well.  Same as the dad on Leave It To Beaver.  That adds an extra special dark touch to Lynch's showing of seemingly wholesome middle America's underbelly.<br/><br/>
You get the idea of the many layers of this film.  This is a piece of celluloid you could talk about with your friends for hours, if you have any friends.  I don't, but that's neither here nor there nor blue nor square, ya dig?<br/><br/>
Anyways, see Blue Velvet as soon as humanly possible.  The weirdest thing of all about David Lynch and is his movies is that he considers himself a conservative.  He loves  Reagan, America, etc.  That makes him and his work all the more weird I guess. A wedding of visuals and magic weaved by a master craftman (David Lynch) buy a dozen German beers, then watch it. there is more to this than meets the eye, gangsters, sickly sweet nice people, Rosalini naked, classic 60s soundtrack, Lunatics who love miming weirdos... It has humour and action, suspense etc... Angelo Badalamenti is a composer who has worked with David Lynch on several films. Therefore the sound and feel of Badalamenti's music is so much a part of Lynch's films. Blue Velvet is another example. The experimentalist attitude of Badalamenti works successfully in this picture. Keep your ears open when watching this film for his score. (not the songs, but the score; there is a big difference). If you haven't had the pleasure in seeing a great film of the 80's you must watch Blue Velvet. Lynch shows you reality magnified ten folds. The cast is brilliant and the story is, well, perfectly not Hollywood. Lynch is ahead of his time and will eventually be recognized as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Mommy loves you! During this film David Lynch appears to have resisted his tendency to wander around in strangeness for strangeness' sake. Fans of Frank Booth (Hopper) should check out the novel Frank's World, which is even more disturbing than the movie.... Blue Velvet has to be one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. It's an odd blend of Happy Days and Natural Born Killers. The movie starts with our hero played by Kyle Mcglacluan who's come home from college to see his dad in the hospital. He stumbles upon a severed ear and the mystery begins. He meets up with Lara Durn(police chief's daughter) and the hardy boyish story line unfolds to more than they expected. At the center of the ear investigation is a lounge singer played by Rossilnni. And from there the movie takes one of the most drastic turns I have ever seen delivering a powerful scene in which Hopper completely takes over the film. The contrast between perfect town usa and a drug and perverse underworld really sold this movie. Publicly booed and praised this movie seemed to affect everyone differently. Weather bad or good its hands down the most talked about, and most praised movie of '86, maybe the entire decade. This is truly a director's film made for and by David Lynch. To me it's a masterpiece of film making because there is no compromise involved. Lynch over directed everyone of note except Hopper who delivers a performance beyond description. If your a Dennis Hopper fan you can't miss this movie. I rented this movie about a year ago, mostly because Kyle Maclachlan is my favorite actor, but also to see what the big deal was. I must say, this movie is pretty creepy and very "out there" for its time! The same time period that gave us "Full House" and Debbie Gibson, also gave us this horrifying look into small town America with the most disgusting villain I have ever seen on film in my life (Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth)! That really boggles the mind, for if this movie was released now, it would really be no big deal and would probably go unnoticed. I must say, the only thing I liked about this movie was Kyle. He was and still is so HOT! Talk about 1980s, Kyle definately had that "I-look-like-I-belong-in-an-80s-newwave-boyband" look down pat! Okay, kind of an odd thing to say about this controversial movie, but hey, it's my opinion! ;) I'm one of those people who refuse to recognize David Lynch as one of the great directors of our time. However, Blue Velvet was especially good (unlike Lost Highway, for example) in that it actually held my attention for an hour and a half, and Lynch didn't have to play the weirdness card to do it. Instead, he provided an intriguing story line, a frightening and unpredictable villain, and a protagonist whose fate you actually cared about. It was good to the last 5 minutes.  All-in-all, definitely worth checking out. Blue Velvet is a masterpiece. Brilliant and unsettling...this is the work of an all-American visionary- and a master film stylist. Lynch is in complete control of the images that are to become part of his world. The film generates excitement and exudes mood from its first shots. In fact, Blue Velvet sets up its cinematic premise from the opening credits. Bold, unabashed color paints the film. Lynch, as always creates a world of his own. The film presents each scene as vividly and crafts shot as graphically as possible. But Lynch never comments-he presents. He uses incidents of a story and elements of film to fashion his movie world. He tells us that the world is an amalgamation of contradictions. Life is both good and bad,  as is everyone who lives it. David Lynch's best piece of art. Nuff said. The film is disturbing and cruel. It paints your way out of a picture and into the real world. The setting over a synchronized small, lumber town and then the disturbance of the outside world will shock you. A definite must see for people who think everything is cherry blossoms and PTA meetings. Gritty...would make a great Broadway Musical flop Immediately this film captures our attention. We see this nice, pleasant looking town and hear the strains of the song Blue Velvet and a man watering his garden. Then the man collapses and the camera pans down to the floor, and underneath the grass we see all the ugly nasty creatures that lurk there, just like the humans in this town. It really is a film that has a bit of everything: sadness, cruelty, corruption, perversion, but ends with the picture of a bird and the tranquility and normality that resumes after Frank Booth gets what he deserves. It is beautifully shot, brilliantly acted (especially Hopper and Rossellini) and is one of my favourite films. A masterpiece. we all have our secrets...and lynch shows how even white picket fences can sometimes have blood stains.  this is a great movie...its eerieness is what captivated me, its not the best movie, but its definitely a favorite of mine... Strange, fun, scary movie.  Norman Rockwell on a hard acid trip. David Lynch had miraculously been given enough money to push the envelope of Hollywood storytelling.  Thank you, Mr. DeLaurentiis!<br/><br/>Don't watch it with your mom. Blue Velvet is a great surreal work of art.  Both intensely disturbing and funny.  The story is a device by Lynch to explore desires 'hidden' in all of us.  David Lynch obsessivley 'pulls back the surface' to contrast light with dark, Evil with good.  Dennis Hopper is shocking and explosive in Blue Velvet, the 'In dreams' scene where Frank is on a joy ride is a movie classic, a scene of virtuosity.<br/><br/>It is 'The' film of the 1980's and a milestone for independent cinema  but more importantly it is a fully fledged masterpiece in it's own right.  I cannot recommend this film enough Never before has an American director, or any other for that matter, achieved the level of sinister elegance that permeates *Blue Velvet*-- what an unqualified success-- its subtleties & layers are too numerous & complex to discuss here... What a film-- hypnotic, stylish, perverse, brilliant! Let me say at the onset that I consider Blue Velvet one of the five best American films of the eighties ( which, admittedly were not the greatest decade for American film). ( the other four-and this will start arguments-were Raging Bull, The Elephant Man, Melvin and Howard, and Paris, Texas ). It was a genuinely spooky, utterly bizarre, often weirdly funny film , that clings to the memory. Sadly, David Lynch has too often pursued weirdness for the sake of weirdness, but at his best he has been an American original, with deep roots in( and a profound understanding of) our culture. It is only fitting that one of his future projects should be to produce a film about another American master of the whimsical and the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe. This is another film from David Lynch that will uphold my high opinion of his abilities.  Despite some poor acting on the part of a few actors, the story is very interesting, and even more so, the expected strange take on directing.  I especially enjoyed the "bug" scene from the opening sequence.<br/><br/>Lynch fans, and anyone who cares for disturbingly different films will almost certainly enjoy this one. This film works so well. It not only captivates as a dark thriller, but also poses questions on good and evil to their extremes, merging fantasy and reality in a cognitive way without interfering with the plot. The cast are well chosen, apparently when Dennis Hopper read the script for 'Frank', he phoned David Lynch and said 'I AM Frank Booth!'. David Lynch and Dennis Hopper at their peak. Blue Velvet is a masterpiece.I have seen it about 7-8 times now and it still resonates like the first time I saw it. Every scene is like a painting that David Lynch put together to make one whole masterpiece.Frank Booth is by far Dennis Hopper's best role.He is menacing and over the top at the same time. Isabella Rosellini is also excellent in a dazed, yet sexy performance. Some of the acting is campy and overblown, but it is done for effect. The picture made me want to know more about the characters and what their lives were about. It is David Lynch's masterpiece that hasn't been equaled since! A perfectly executed neo-noir film, BLUE VELVET, is also probably one of the finest films ever made of any genre.  It is very subtly plotted and sub-plotted, quite stylish but never at the expense of substance, satirical in the Juvenalian sense, and has a consistent and unobtrusive Freudian symbolism underlying it (think of the ear, or of the father laying on the lawn holding the spraying hose in the beginning of the film etc. etc.)  In short, this film succeeds in every way that PULP FICTION, RESERVOIR DOGS, and THE USUAL SUSPECTS fails.  BLUE VELVET is a brilliant film from a sometimes brilliant director (LOST HIGHWAY? WILD AT HEART? DUNE?) and should be required viewing for any serious noir fan. (as should, incidentally and for different reasons, Lynch's other great artistic success, THE ELEPHANT MAN). This film is quintessential Lynch.  Light and dark, normal and warped.  The sugar-sappiness of the town of Lumberton is contrasted by the depravity that Jeffrey sees and Dorothy and Frank inhabit. Jeffrey actually becomes a fragment of Frank even though he is repulsed by him.  In fact, it is his curiousity and repulsion that draws him in.<br/><br/>More than one viewing of this film is required. Dean Stockwell is so suave . Honestly, this one is not for everyone, but a must for Lynch fans. Man, Lynch is a master. The way he establishes a mood of naive innocence and surface virtue, then abruptly scrapes it away to reveal a dark sickness that lurks beneath, slapping us across the face with its starkness, is something that other directors just can't do as well.<br/><br/>Just as in the opening of the movie, when the perfect lawn in the perfect town is revealed to be infested with insectoid filth, the plot of the movie unfolds to reveal a depth of evil in the town I wasn't quite ready for. Frank, the villain, was, I think, the most terrifying twisted and evil character I've ever encountered in either reality or fiction. I noticed that there is absolutely no coarse language in the whole film until Frank comes on screen, and then every second word is the f-word, and you almost can't believe what you're seeing and hearing--you simply can't believe that in this seemlingly normal town, such a thing could exist.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me was when Kyle McLachlan was taken for a "Joy Ride" by Frank and his boys. It was a nightmare ride into the darkest side of human nature, a ride that I'm surprised didn't give me nightmares last night.<br/><br/>Anyway, I recommend this film. It's warped, weird and depressing. But also quite brilliant. I saw Blue Velvet today in a film class and hours later,I still can't get it out of my mind.I'll be thinking about this movie for days to come.Blue Velvet has to be one of the most disturbing yet intriguing movies ever made.It's like a nightmare put on film.The movie make you feel like you're watching a mad man's dreams come true.I won't go into plots and character developments,you could probably find that out from other reviews.But two things that I have to point out are.<br/><br/>1)Dennis Hopper who plays Frank Booth has to be one of the most disturbing and insane villians ever put on film.He ranks up there with Hannibal Lecter. 2)David Lynch did a wonderful job directing this movie.The lighting was incredibly done,it adds to the mood of the film.This is the first time I ever saw a David Lynch movie and I was very impressed by his work.I've heard some things about Lost Highway and Muholland Drive,but I never had a chance to check them out.My next priority will be to see those movies.<br/><br/>So I'd advise anyone who is reading this review and hasn't seen this film, to turn the computer off and go and rent this film.This movie ranks up there with Requiem for a Dream,Clockwork Orange,and Memento as movies that will leave you thinking about it for days. 9/10 For me, this is a marvelous construction of imagery and sound, and fascinates me even 15 years after I first saw it on video.  The odd characters, non-sequiter dialogue, and bizarre tableux all combine to create a sensation akin to a dream or nightmare, and prefigure what director David Lynch would later bring to life in his TV series "Twin Peaks". <br/><br/>
I find this entertaining, though not in the usual sense.  "Blue Velvet" is more a play of ideas than a straightforward, plot-driven film.  It's difficult to say what it all adds up to.  There's a bit of traditional film noir mystery, satire of small-town life, plus a strong thread of perverse eroticism.  A lot of critics say it's a commentary on the dark underbelly of normal society, but I think that's oversimplification.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to everyone, though.  "Blue Velvet" definitely might bore, confuse or offend a lot of people, like most of Lynch's work. However, if you are interested in movies that forego standard storytelling and instead toy around with ideas or are an expression of individual artistic (or self-indulgent and pretentious, take your pick) impulses, I think it's worth a look. It's already more or less been said. This is a profoundly moving, very powerful film. It doesn't pull punches or resort to traditional Hollywoodisms. Very honestly disgusting and terrifying every time it sets out to be, and otherwise just honest. Strange, but _real_.<br/><br/>My personal favorite scene is the confrontation with Mike.<br/><br/>However, the entirely happy ending left me feeling a little empty. An emotional relief, but... I suppose it felt as if the movie backed out and pulled the final blow which would have had me hiding under my bed for the rest of time. Disappointing. But make no mistake: the ending was _nice_. And before it, the film was incredible. I saw this vastly overrated piece of Dreck many years ago on the big screen, and there are several things I remember: <br/><br/>1. Isabella Rossellini trying hard to present herself as a professional actress - and failing miserably. Besides, she was hardly eye-candy; like her mother Ingrid Bergman, but even less feminine.<br/><br/>2. Dennis Hopper doing one of his numerous crazed, bizarre psycho shticks. Watching him wear a gas-mask and cry "mother!" every five minutes was painfully embarrassing to watch. Nothing "artistic" about it; just a bunch of crap, really.<br/><br/>3. Laura Dern. I had never seen this 7-foot gork before, and was appalled that nepotism had gotten so out of control. (I guess ANYONE can get a shot in movies these days.) There is a MEMORABLE scene in which she is supposed to cry, but her face twists into such a grotesque form that I literally had to laugh out loud.<br/><br/>A silly/dull plot and a bad cast do not a great movie make. Lynch made his best movies at the outset, with "Eraserhead" and "The Elephant Man". Everything he did after that was average or forgettable.<br/><br/>The only things to recommend this mediocre and supposedly weird and "deep" Lynch non-effort are the opening scene and the title tune. Too bad Mystery Science Theater isn't still aired - I'm sure this was the next "movie" in their queue... 7.8? Another proof point to the herd mentality. Herd of drones got together, made this movie, birthed it from the bowels of Hollywood and then wrote about how wonderful their creation was. Except, well, the GLARING fact that this movie is the worst movie ever! Seriously ppl. 7.8? I'm convinced these same people thought Howard the Duck was a masterpiece(yet, I don't want to degrade The Duck)<br/><br/>Alas, someday maybe, I'll enjoy this movie again only to be seen on mystery science theater 3000. In the meantime, I'll always look back, with regret, at the hours lost viewing this horrid movie. "Blue Velvet" was a film that was loved by many, as far as I understand.  It was the most acclaimed film of the eighties, though it seems strange that 2 of the most major critics, Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert, gave it sour reviews.  Maybe it was a timely film.  Because I sure as heck didn't get it.<br/><br/>I hear people talking about the symbolism of this film.  They're probably right.  There probably is a lot of symbolism involved, and maybe I just didn't indulge the film correctly.  Whatever way you look at it, it's an unpleasant journey and it sure as heck doesn't get its point across objectively.  It's good for a film to be deep and more than meets the eye...but first there has to be at least a little something that meets the eye.  <br/><br/>What regular viewers like me, and probably most people, see is a sadistic journey into the oblivion, structured in a B-movie format.  I've seen tons of movies in my lifetime, so I'm not easily disturbed--but this one disturbed the hell out of me!  With a film like "Fight Club" there are some gratuitous, explicit brawls--but it was much more than a macho-man action flick.  And it was evident--all the social satire.  "Blue Velvet" just comes off as pure camp.  <br/><br/>Yes, this is a DIFFERENT movie.  I have to admit that.  And I usually appreciate a movie that's original.  But I'll make an exception in this case.  Dennis Hopper is a terrific actor, and I feel he was wasted in this dark but perverted and silly role.  His job is to demonstrate extreme perversion and yell out the maximum amount of "f" words that are allowed in an R-rated film.<br/><br/>David Lynch fans will probably adore a film like this, and have extended discussions in years and years to come.  To them, it's probably a timeless classic.  But to me, and the normal moviegoer, this is a sick, twisted, low-brow piece of motion picture madness that is just plain unpleasant. People can watch it again, but what are the chances that they would want to experience this sickness for a second round? This is a movie you have to watch more than once to really start to like it. My rating was initially much lower than the current 8/10 after my first viewing, once I had seen it a few more times I really started to appreciate it for the gem that it is.<br/><br/>David Lynch is one seriously twisted genius, if anything this movie is pretty much a testament to this. While startling with it's disturbing portrait of a seemingly pristine suburbia gone bad, the story telling is actually pretty reeled in and less bizarre than some of his other films. <br/><br/>Lynch is a master of symbolism and cleverly shows the viewer binary oppositions, underscoring how man has the capacity to be noble or diabolical.<br/><br/>This movie made me a big fan of Laura Dern, she is absolutely mesmerizing in this movie and her low whisper like sentences make the viewer fall in love with her elegance. The music by Roy Orbison is also just brilliant, but I have always been a fan.<br/><br/>The use of colors in the film are masterful, purple, pink, magenta, green, blue. It's like each scene is a painting. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that really makes you remember why you like movies in the first place. <br/><br/>Highly recommended and one you just have to watch more than once to really appreciate. What is most intriguing about this film is the contrast between the reaction of the average moviegoer (so mind-numbingly boring that they were barely able to sit through it) and the local intelligentsia ("brilliant", "innovative", one comment compares Lynch to "Bergman, Fellini, and Bunuel" Â– insert the sound of gagging here).<br/><br/>Although these extreme comments are very entertaining they are pretty much useless for anyone thinking about whether to view this film. So what did those with extreme opinions find or fail to find in this film? My guess is that they found about same thing but reacted to it in very opposite ways. The film is a rather obvious dark satire on the hypocrisy of American culture-what lies under the thin veneer of middle class society. So the disparate viewer reactions may just be political. And while an entertaining film with subtle subversive messages can have mass appeal, Blue Velvet is not a particularly entertaining film. Nor is it a particularly subtle film although Lynch does try to keep the viewer confused by suggesting that some of what we are viewing (or have viewed) is a dream and by keeping many details ambiguous (such as just what is Hopper inhaling-helium?).<br/><br/>It is not important that we know any of this stuff for sure anyway, as viewers can fill in the missing pieces with whatever fits their personal agenda. This is the same technique that Lynch relies on in "Mulholland Drive". Both films are filled with contrived plot twists, misdirection, and insanely over-the-top characters. You stay with the story to find out how Lynch will manage the seemingly impossible task of pulling all these disparate plot elements together by the end of the film. Of course what seems impossible is impossible, Lynch has to cheat at the end, turning what appeared to be realism into expressionism. Lynch relies on the fact that instead of feeling cheated, a large segment of his audience will instead credit him a degree of vision never seen before in cinema history. Since there is nothing to contradict their interpretation they credit him with the visionary genus to have intentionally placed each element that supports their interpretation in the film.<br/><br/>Despite the many negative comments, this cheating does not make "Blue Velvet" a bad film. Indeed Lynch's ability to make something expressionistic look like realism is amazing as long as you credit Lynch with a brilliant technique and not with a brilliant vision. That said there are some basic problems with "Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>The first problem is that the underlying depravity in suburban America is very ordinary and unexceptional and not the imaginative "deep into the recesses of our minds" stuff portrayed in this film. Even less controversial suburban portrayals like "The Graduate" and "American Beauty" feature what would be considered extreme behavior, as the average suburbanite is more mundane and far less adventurous than the protagonists of those films.<br/><br/>The second problem is that you have to constantly work at suspending your belief that this is a film. Burning mental energy just trying to stay 'in' the story does not make for a good movie-going experience. Although Dern and Hopper are fine, MacLaughlin and Rossellini are simply awful. So the viewer tends to wonder what is going through Rossellini's (the actress) mind during the filming of each scene and not what is going through her character's mind. And I am writing in terms of cast names and not character names. MacLaughlin seems to be in almost all Lynch's films and his career specialty is sapping the energy from scenes.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" starts with some great images: ideal suburbia - kids crossing the street, firemen waving as they go down the road on their truck, and a man watering his garden. Then the guy has a stroke and collapses. We are then treated to the best shot of the film: his dog playfully jumping around the squirting hose he continues to hold as a toddler ambles toward him. Then the camera moves down for a macro shot of the insect world in his lawn. This bears an interesting similarity to Blair Treu's 2003 film "Little Secrets", where one of the children runs a business of keeping all the neighborhood secrets in a safe place for a fee. Ostensibly a squeaky-clean family film, "Little Secrets" takes Lynch's basic theme and turns it into a lesson about friendship and trust.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet's" strong point is the cinematography, which is absolutely gorgeous and dreamlike. It's weakness (in addition to those already mentioned) is that its weirdness is positioned midway between 'The Graduate' and 'The Doom Generation'. It somehow manages to be both inaccessible and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Suburbia is a place to escape the problems of the world and those who choose to inhabit suburbia do so because they are either afraid of the world or just too lazy to be exceptional; and not because they are the creatively perverse villains of "Blue Velvet". David Lynch's Blue Velvet is many things, but it definitely is one of the most audacious and original pictures from the 80's. It blends in humor from the good old days and macabre that would make Tobe Hooper cringe (if only a little bit). It's a type of movie filled with so much style and little cinema tricks that some might not see the substance. I saw it about three times in two days to get it all in and I must say that the films themes do match the style on the surface. Beneath is something that the viewer will have to judge and I can not go into.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLaughlin plays a regular kid who comes upon a single ear and that is the start of his search to find who is behind the cutting of this ear. He and another teenage girl (Laura Dern in a very early role), or mainly by himself, he fins a possibly mentally unbalanced nightclub singer (Isabella Rosselini) is in danger from a hopped up madman, played by Dennis Hopper in one of his top 5 roles ever. One thing I should point out though, is that when I said it is in the viewer's hands often in this film is because Rosselini's character is alternately meant to be sympathetic, but then she does acts and wants acts done to her (get my drift) that will make many seem puzzled as how a woman caught in a situation like the one she's in can be so f***ed up.<br/><br/>In the overall view, the film brings a compelling story brought even more compelling with awesome performances and style to burn. Some might not find the humor spread about and might feel angry (a certain R. Ebert for example) when uneeded satire is brought to a scene where a woman is lying naked on a lawn. But I just think it's meant to soften the shock, if only in some demented way. A worthwhile view into the perpetual dark-side of human nature, if only once. A+ Blue Velvet is a horrible excuse for horror. The acting and dialogue is atrocious with nearly every line is super cringey, delivered very unnaturally, or so blatantly scripted that there's no way anyone could relate to any of the characters. The plot is equally terrible, going nowhere in the most unrealistic ways while every main character behaves completely opposite of their character backgrounds for no apparent reason with no sign of remorse or nervousness as they commit crimes and adultery on a whim. I guess I'm never going to fit on with the reviewer elite since I can't seem to see a film the same way they did.<br/><br/>I found the whole plot was quite disjointed. Dennis Hopper's psychotic character was never allowed to develop and I felt embarrassed for him throughout his scenes.<br/><br/>There's a lot of awkward scenes - maybe they are supposed to be - but I don't watch movies to feel awkward and confused. I felt some of the scenes were done just for the sake of airing the directors weird ideas.<br/><br/>So many people love this film but I didn't.<br/><br/>Boring and didn't go anywhere. I really wanted to give 0 stars but there isn't an option for 0. For one thing, I don't like surreal movies because you can't ever really get into them because you can't take them seriously. This was just plain nonsense and idiotic. In one scene, the cop was basically dead, yet he could still stand! That's just dumb. And you couldn't really feel for the girl in trouble because she wanted to get beat up, so what was the point in wanting to save her? And what a wasted role for Dennis Hopper. His character was shallow and goofy and so unrealistic it was laughable, but I couldn't even laugh at this movie(if you could even call it that) because it was so terrible. Don't waste your time on this movie. It is awful. I don't think it's worth to see this movie nowadays (2011), probably it was shocking or exciting at its time.. but now it's just boring and lame.<br/><br/>I would not recommend it to anyone... I don't understand why they call it a "classic".<br/><br/>As other reviewer say, it is a very low budget crap with a predictable story line using over the top porno/psycho scenes to get some kind of viewer interest - I totally agree with that, It's just nonsense, predictable and boring.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. I saw this film in the late-1980s. It was hyped as intelligent, artsy, hip, sophisticated. It was seen as a break from dreary 80s cinema. Lynch's techniques were new and innovative. I thought of it as a good film back then, and every pretentious yuppie adored it.<br/><br/>In 2019, its badly dated and Lynch's ingenious directorial style comes of as pretentious nonsense. Its a film about style, and symbolism. We get the imagery of the savage and grotesque contrasted with the beautiful and innocent. Pretty cool I guess, but its unrelenting, we are subjected to this over and over again.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the lack of any substance, its not story telling, the dialogue and characters are not developed and forgettable. Its pretentious nonsense that film school wannabees rave about, because they think there is something deep. There isn't. In 2019, I couldn't recommend this to anyone. Heck, I couldn't even make it to the end. Not a huge fan of David Lynch, but I liked this one. Because it made much more sense than some of his other movies and it had a nice neo-noir thing going. Strong performances by Rossellini and Hopper. 15 year old me was craving something like this but maybe I got my hopes way too high because I thought the ultimate effect was rather risible.<br/><br/>Stylish, colorful and inventive, its plot is really just some generic mystery with a little kinkiness thrown in. It's quite the turn on a reluctant voyeur gets more than he expected in more ways than one and the first act is pretty tense and intriguing in this respect.<br/><br/>It struggles to really keep itself interesting after this point. It's not about the mystery of course, it's about the voyeur and darkness in us all and there's something about innocents and corruption but it didn't make me care.<br/><br/>Sort of like Eraserhead or The Shining, the whole thing is too hysterical for the final impression to be much more than humor and fascination. The whole thing takes itself way too seriously to be sure and other than that Italian MILF, the performances are entirely too melodramatic and stilted.<br/><br/>It's possible to be stylized (and that's the word I would use for this, it's not surreal) without being on the nose but this didn't manage it.<br/><br/>To it's credit, it's still a daring and vivid picture that's always fun to watch even if you tune out what they're saying and the music direction is superb. Right now, while I'm trying to get some inspiration, the melody of "Blue Velvet" is playing in my memory and I can't get that "she wore blue velvet" out of my head... you expect movies to fascinate you on a visual, emotional and intellectual level but it's often the music that ends up winning you. But is that really a surprise for a movie whose starting point is the discovery of a severed ear.<br/><br/>The film opens with the now iconic shot of the beautiful flowers towered by proud, white picket fences, a jolly fireman waving at the camera, images of a perfect and harmonious suburb in some middle town of America... but it immediately invites us to look closer and what we see are crawling bugs under the land. All it takes is just to be curious enough to make the ugliest discoveries. And Lynch sure knows how to make ugliness hypnotically attractive.<br/><br/>And even beauty can have the opposite effect. I know it's a movie that invites for a deep analysis and I'm never stingy on paragraphs when a film arouses my mind and my feelings, but I want to give a personal and sincere approach to "Blue Velvet". And for that, I'll mention the first Lynch work I was familiar with, "Twin Peaks". I was a kid when the TV series aired and there was so much publicity that I started to watch it, I wanted to know who killed Laura Palmer and I really expected a banal detective mystery. After three or four episodes, I gave up as it became too creepy for my taste.<br/><br/>But Friday was the 'Twin Peaks' day and even though I was watching another program, I was always tempted to have a peek on the series, as but I felt weirdly drawn to it. And you know what scared me the most about it? The ending credits' sequence, for some reason, the prom picture of Laura Palmer scared the hell out of me, not because of the picture but for all the creepiness it carried, all the secrets lying behind that adorable face. It was the symbolic content. That is how Lynch movies works, nothing is about what it seems to be about, and beauty and ugliness are such intertwining notions that you can only take some perspective by admitting that the world is strange.<br/><br/>So "Blue Velvet" starts with a severed ear that leads to one discovery after another : a beautiful singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini); then another a pervert sadomasochistic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and as the investigation progresses, so many new strange protagonists unfold, it just gets out of control. "Twin Peaks" started like routine murder investigation and see how it ended. But I think "Blue Velvet" works better than "Twin Peaks" because the investigators are amateurs.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) discovers the ear and stars his journey into the heart of the city's darkness with the help of Sandy, a perfect pretty blonde girl played by Laura Dern. The most emblematic moment is when Jeffrey hides in a closet and watch Dorothy getting naked and just when you thought you're watching a beautiful woman, she opens the door, threatens to kill Jeffrey... but it's all an act, she's actually aroused. And when Frank comes, she literally gives herself, but it's a rather one-sided sex that ensues, and disturbing.<br/><br/>"What a strange world we live on" is the comment Jeffrey shares with Sandy, and it's quite neutral. Sandy is shocked. Both youngsters embody our own point of view, we're disturbed but aroused, it doesn't just work on a rational level, that's how it surpasses "Twin Peaks". That the two sleuths fall in love isn't even surprising, it represents the side of our perspective that wished they could just drop the whole case and enjoy their growing attraction. And again, music always finds a way to seal a relationship like "Blue Velvet" is Dorothy's seduction weapon, there's a beautiful romantic dance scene between Jeffrey and Sandy that elevates the film as a tender romance.<br/><br/>Yes, tender. Sandy wonders if Jeffrey's a detective or a pervert, but strangely enough, I never questioned his moral outlook, and I knew he cared for Dorothy out of sympathy and decency. The film never plays it like a love triangle and I applaud Lynch for not having swum in the usual waters. The film is noir in its themes and motifs but the characterization is rather straight, we know who the victims, villains and heroes are. <br/><br/>The film is considered one of the greatest mysteries, but I doubt it has to do with the crime but on the thought-provoking questions it raises: , why are we attracted by what can kill us? Why do we take risks? Maybe because that's the most thrilling part of life. Maybe for ethical reasons, to help those who can't be seen? Maybe that's what this ear found on the ground is about people who scream every day but we can't hear them, the film invites you to look and hear closer, for you might confront a Frank once in your life. Fear doesn't avoid danger. <br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is a movie so rich and visionary that it can easily fool you at a first viewing, it even fooled Ebert who got the raw realism of the darker scenes right but took the other ones with "corny" dialogues as artistic licenses meant to distract from the gripping realism. I don't think it did that more than it established the contrast between two worlds that are so close they might represent the own duplicity of our soul, from the secrets and fantasies hidden in our souls' closets.<br/><br/>This is a disturbing movie raising disturbing questions. And it's so beautiful; I wouldn't mind asking myself as many disturbing questions as it'll take to admire its beauty. This movie had been on my to-watch list for probably 10 years. I have seen the majority of Lynch's movies but some of the older ones had eluded me for some reason. Really glad I finally watched it. Out of the gate: The remastered version looks fantastic. Vivid colours and doesn't look the least bit dated. Even the fashion is pretty understated for an 80s movie. Kyle MacLachlan plays kind of a moon-eyed young adult that gets in a little over his head. Laura Dern has such a wonderful understated performance as well. Which was that much more enjoyable knowing that she went on to do much more intense and at times crazy characters. Dennis Hopper is playing a villain type that he certainly revisit a few times in his career. But here he is full of menace rather than Super Mario Bros super-villain. He's sadistic, violent and frightening. While at the same time seeming to enjoy himself. Probably the only performance I wasn't that impressed was Isabella Rossellini's. She has her moments but her anguish at times felt a bit like soap- opera acting. The story overall moves along quite well and this is one of Lynch's more straight-forward movies. I was slightly disappointed that I wasn't surprised by anything that happened. The ending was quite conventional if you compare it to some of his later works. But it's still such a great story told in that 'Lynchian' way that I couldn't help but thoroughly enjoy it. "Blue Velvet" is a film of the eighties, with all the features of this decade, pop music, scenes through music video, features clothes, gray photography ... But it's a film that also has the face of Lynch, and what he wants to tell you is very simple: Nothing is perfect. The film begins by showing a beautiful and perfect neighborhood in a suburban city of the United States, and then the camera shows an anthill, making this analogy perfection, that throughout the film is much more detailed, full of scenes that make us question the sanity of it being shown, Lynch challenges us to understand a mystery that involves police, sex maniacs, psychopaths, drug dealers and crazy, the film has no misteriozinho, because halfway through the movie you already understand the "mystery", but still you want to continue watching the movie because you question why this happens, the script is brilliant, with suspense doses, comedy and romance, as the technical details I do not have much to talk about, because as I said before, is a typical 80s movie, nothing is very good or very noticeable, others more like the viewer, the acting is good, nothing great. Well, the movie is great, one of my favorite Lynch, and worth much apena gives a given. Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his home town due to his fathers failing health. But town isn't as great as it was before, for Jeffrey find a detached ear in a field. He brings it to the sheriff, who isn't a lot of help.Not until he meets Sandy, the sheriffs daughter, does he receive the information he needs. <br/><br/>If your a stranger to David Lynch then this movie may throw you off a bit. It's tame compared to Eraserhead or Twin Peaks, but still holds his trademark strangeness. <br/><br/>You find out that the ear belongs to the husband of Dorothy Vallens, a beautiful lounge singer who's son and husband have been kidnapped by Frank Booth, a mob boss. He has been using and abusing her, in exchange for keeping them alive. <br/><br/>The acting in this is decent, Dennis Hopper I think did a great job playing a perverted asshole, and Isabella Rossellini did great as Dorothy. She really had the victim part down and did it straight, unlike Hopper who was very over the top. Kyle MacLachlan on the other hand was extremely bland. Every scene he was in made me think he woke up an hour ago and slapped some makeup on him and gave him a coffee. He didn't bring any excitement to the role and came off as dull, similar to him in Dune. I'm very happy he got it together for Twin Peaks, where he was much better.<br/><br/>If you want a strange and interesting story, maybe look somewhere else, but if you just want a straight mystery, I would consider Blue Velvet. Its like a longer episode of a mystery show. This film starts off full of mystery and gripping intrigue; the viewer is immediately dropped into an exclusive zone of pure crime, very quickly and heavily tinged with Lynch eccentricity stains. But as we dive deeper into the plot, things get uneasy, very fast, and sometimes just about reaching the point of ridiculousness or flat out indecency, but while never actually overtaking that threshold. This manages to stay coherent, firmly together. It explores insanity and overt bizarreness on screen, but keeps on telling its story and never goes overboard, which is truly some feat considering how strange this will get overtime. Some taboo themes are developed or strongly implied here, sexual themes/relations in particular, but oddly enough they're both flagged with stigma and at the same time given a kind of indifference pass, somewhat. They're just elements of the story as it goes, really; the material which fills the mold.<br/><br/>It does make for a very fun, entertaining ride regardless, but might possibly get just a little bit too sexually obvious for some, while not explicitly graphic. Just at the very limit, always. Very original, and a strong piece of cinema to enjoy. "Blue Velvet" exists as two separate films for most of it, until they mesh at the end, like the two worlds of the film. The film explores a seedy underworld of a seemingly perfect suburban environment when Jeffrey Beaumont discovers a severed ear in a field during a visit to his dying father in his old home town. Jeffrey hears that a suspect for the murder lives close to him, named Dorothy Vallens, and with the help of a detective's daughter, Sandy Williams, he manages to sneak into her house. At first she seems disturbed and threatening, but soon enough Jeffrey discovers that she is sexually abused, and it seems her son has been stolen by this man. She clearly needs help, and Jeffrey digs deeper. But as he is also having sexual relations with Dorothy in the terrifying and strange thriller part of the film, he begins a romance with Sandy during the cheesy 80s teen romance part of the film. The way this film flips these 80s stereotypes on its head is by showing how this perfect green grass hides nasty beetles, metaphorically speaking. We think Jeffrey is a good person, but we also see how he has the potential to be just as abusive as the true criminal, Frank. Speaking of Frank, Dennis Hopper's performance as him is incredibly over the top and occasionally hilarious, but that only makes it all the more terrifying when the characters are in legitimate danger since we know how unexpected and wild he can be when he inhales some unexplained drug. But I digress. Back to what I was saying, Jeffrey also abandons Dorothy at the end of the film so he can be with Sandy, and we see some of the same shots we saw at the beginning of the movie, and a robin, which the film has established as a symbol of love, holding a beetle, the symbol for evil, in it's mouth, symbolizing that their love has conquered evil. We also see Dorothy's son running into her arms, but as the song Blue Velvet plays, we realize that the characters will never be the same again, despite everything seemingly come back to normal. The term post modernism is used so loosely these days, David Lynch however secures the winning title of a post modern piece of film. The film is shocking, brilliant, twisted, nightmarish! Dennis Hopper's screwed up performance is one of the things most people remember, and as far as David Lynch's 'weird' films are concerned, this is probably one of his most accessible, where the weirdness is kept in check, just about within the realms of acceptability as far as most film fans are concerned I would imagine. Pretty much buried on release in the mid-eighties, it's since gone on to accumulate quite a bit of respect and cult love.<br/><br/>This is one of Lynch's great gifts to cinema (which he has repeated a number of times, albeit with differences): his stylistic and thematic choice of presenting the worlds of desire and fantasy separately. Unlike other films by Lynch, such as Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet ends on a quasi-happy note (though with plenty of irony still). Jeffrey vanquishes his enemy Frank, Dorothy's son is returned to her, and Jeffrey and Sandy live happily ever after. However, those ironic elements have the last say in the film: the fireman, the roses and that ludicrous robin almost smiling at Jeffrey and Sandy, and by extension us. The film is thus disturbingly hilarious and I found myself laughing at the end on some occasions, though with a sinister feeling too.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10. I'm not going to under-exaggerate. Blue Velvet is the most terrifying film I've ever watched. David Lynch's surreal thriller is more nightmarish than any horror film could ever hope to be. A young man finds a severed ear crawling with insects in a field, and an investigation begins into who's responsible. There is a starling scene where the camera zooms into the ear canal, which is infested with bugs, and doesn't withdraw. That is a good metaphor for the film itself; a terrifying journey into the dark underworld hidden beneath a seemingly normal suburb. That is the key to the film's nightmarish quality: everything appears so normal, but there is always a terrifying threat lurking beneath the surface. The film retains its horrific quality from beginning to end. Through its truly terrifying yet ingeniously subtle direction, a layered, enigmatic script and a truly haunting soundtrack (The title song is so unnerving it's almost harrowing to listen to), BV succeeds on every level. The performances are also great, with Dennis Hopper giving one of the most horrifying performances ever as the villain. Not only a harrowing movie, but crucially a powerful and at times strangely moving one too, meaning it's not just completely horrible to watch. A truly unbelievable movie which I can't praise enough, but be prepared for a true shocker. A masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10 Blue Velvet is a film you should definitely see if you are a fan of filmmaking or noir or the surreal, but it is a hard film to recommend. That is mainly because the acclaim it got from when it first came out does not really translate to present day, and so one would tend to get an impression and have expectations that the film is not going to match. It has been so many years and nowadays the vibe of the film is different. At the same time, it really is a good film and perhaps can be better appreciated not for being outrageous or frightening, but rather for some fine filmmaking and acting. In particular, loved the set for the female lead's apartment and the performance by the actress playing her was quite good. The film has many memorable bits and pieces, but the overall vibe is about half as intense as watching an accident involving two vehicles with the highest safety rating and everyone has on their seatbelts. This sounds like it is bad, but it is not. Like I said, it is hard to write a review for. This is really a very good, a very theatrical film; and it is good to see, not so much for shocks and frights, but to appreciate a nice piece of work. It's said that there's a fine line between genius and insanity...and, I believe that David Lynch works both sides of that line while writing and directing - and, creating.<br/><br/>Although not the leading actor, Dennis Hopper's character, 'Frank Booth,' 'takes-the-cake' with his performance here. As eccentric and outrageous as ever ("Paris Trout," 1991; "Speed," 1994; etc.), Dennis Hopper turns Frank Booth into Dennis Hopper...and, back again as they're as wacko as each other, and, it's wonderful actuality-acting!<br/><br/>Laura Dern is as pretty as ever; Isabella Rossellini is as beautiful as ever; Hope Lange is as classy as ever; and, Jack Nance is as deranged and funny as ever (he's also great in "Wild At Heart," 1990); and, that mixed-bag of Frank Booth's friends where Ben (Dean Stockwell) makes his appearance is pathetically-funny yet socially-disturbing!<br/><br/>If you like 'weird' / David Lynch / 'crazy' / Dennis Hopper / 'strange' / Alfred Hitchcock / 'dreams' / "The Wizard of Oz" / John Waters / Roman Polanski / William Castle / Werner Herzog / Frederico Fellini / Russ Meyer / Pier Paolo Pasolini / Herschell Gordon Lewis / Stanley Kubrick / then, here it is...you'll like "Blue Velvet," too!<br/><br/>If you like this movie, I highly-recommend David Lynch's "Wild At Heart" (1990). It's like "Blue Velvet" on high-octane! Along the same vein as other dark "dramedies" like "The Big Lebowski" or "Fargo", both from the Coen Brothers' subconscious, "Blue Velvet" is in that special category of films that not only yearns for a second, and third, and even fourth (and beyond), viewing, but is absolutely deserving of such.<br/><br/>The surrealist tone and approach to this film, which was the first Lynch film that I had ever seen, was jarring for me, and it was uncomfortable for me to laugh at times where it might have been inappropriate, even in the comfort of watching from my queen-sized mattress/sofa.<br/><br/>Lo and behold, I went to a screening of this film in 35mm recently, and the crowd laughed, almost uncontrollably at some points, because they understood that this was such an unbelievably weird experience, that there was almost no choice but to laugh, and I would be guessing if I had said that many in that packed audience probably stayed silent and confused through their first watching of "Blue Velvet" too.<br/><br/>Yes, David Lynch's fourth feature film can be downright uncomfortable and tense, with moments that may cause you to hold your breath every now and then, but overall, this modern-day fairy tale of epic and devastating forces is your one-stop destination on dissecting, and enjoying, everything that makes a Lynch film a Lynch film: a surrealist tone in an otherwise idyllic town, a dark atmosphere with a few quirky notes to boot, and an overall enjoyably pleasurable experience, in the theater or at home. However you watch it, hands down, it is a masterpiece. Blue Velvet - Blu-ray<br/><br/>If you own the DVD, you will know how poor the DVD transfer looks. They made no effort. <br/><br/>First impressions of the Blu-ray on inserting the disc are less than favorable. First up comes the 'Scanbox entertainment' screen, in all it's lo-res glory, looking like a DVD? Next up is the Scanbox Warning screen warning 'This DVD is for home viewing only' again lo-res looking like a DVD? at this point I popped the disc out of the machine just to check it was a Blu-ray and not a DVD, as I had purchased the film from Amazon, and for all I knew, I could have been supplied a returned Film where someone had done a dodgy, and sent a DVD back in a Blu-ray cover. As it turns out, I did in fact have a Blu-ray disc.<br/><br/>The Blu-ray menu screen looks great. Hi-def, well designed, and in keeping with the feel of the film.<br/><br/>Given how old the film is, the Blu-ray looks great. Not super modern digital clean, but good enough, and a hundred times better the DVD release. <br/><br/>I won't comment on the film, as it's David Lynch, and it is what it is, a type of experience. Not gripping, more intriguing, surreal. Having not watched the film since it's DVD release, as I was that appalled at the picture quality, I had forgotten most of the film. It was great to sit through what amounted to a film I hadn't seen before, as I could only remember one scene, with Hopper and the breathing apparatus in the arty pink lounge.<br/><br/>9/10 I saw this on its release in 1986 - it was in a double feature with Betty Blue, which I thought was the better movie. LOL.<br/><br/>Ten years later my opinion was completely reversed. BV is an excellent skewering of normality - "I wouldn't want to eat a bug". Thirty years later I still think Frank Booth is a great monster.<br/><br/>The only problem is the plot ends conventionally, with audience satisfaction at a premium. Lynch came up with the mind blowing Mulholland Dr in 2001, so the contrast is clear.<br/><br/>I hear he can't get a job these days, but I guess he doesn't need one. The closing of the American mind.<br/><br/>Reading the IMDb reviews in Love/Hate setting is interesting - we could be characters in a Lynch movie. Before he became the well-known auteur that he is today, David Lynch was still a highly ambitious director. Blue Velvet was arguably his most ambitious film at the time not because of the scale of the film, but the content. A very controversial film both at the time and still today, Blue Velvet is a twisted vision of an idyllic 50's American town (the kind you might see on Happy Days or Leave it to Beaver) with a seedy underbelly of crime that the residents are blissfully unaware of. This has attracted criticism from some viewers, who believe that Lynch is not-so-subtly poking fun at the town and its inhabitants. While this might be true, I don't think that this detracts from the overall beauty of this film, which shows that even in the most seemingly innocent places in the world, you may find the most evil of characters (in this film, that character is Frank, played by the expertly terrifying Dennis Hopper at the top of his game). Lynch, also the director of Eraserhead, was no stranger to surrealism at the time and while this movie never quite reaches the same level of such that Eraserhead did, his unmistakable style is still there. Overall, I highly recommend Blue Velvet to any fans of Lynch and even more so, I recommend it to anyone who is unfamiliar with his work, as it is a great entry point of the filmography of one of the greatest living American directors. Chicago film critic Roger Ebert is one film critic that I've admired over the years as an movie-goer. But, when it was time to review "Blue Velvet" on his television program, "Siskel and Ebert at the Movies", he gave an scathing review to an film that I think deserved more credit for its style and way of vision. His partner, Gene Siskel, gave the film an highly positive review. He even went further to put "Blue Velvet" on his top 10 Best Films of 1986. To me, I think Mr. Ebert should've understand "Blue Velvet" a whole lot more clearer. I'm not saying that he has a poor taste in film. I'm just saying that some of our most promising film critics can be harsh on great movies. "Blue Velvet" is an strange, disturbing and very stylized film that has a twist to it. In the beginning of the movie, we are introduced by Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who is returning to his hometown of Lumberton from Oak Lake College. Jeffery's father has just suffered a stroke when watering the grass. So, now Jeffery is back in a familiar place, all right. Except for something else. When Jeffery is walking through an field of grass, he comes across an severed ear in the grass. Now, who put it there? Who cut off the ear? The answer is: We don't know. Jeffery reports to the police station to show Detective Williams (George Dickerson). He even begins an friendly relationship with Williams' daughter, Sandy, (Laura Dern). Sandy suspects that the woman who lives in an apartment in the town is acting strange. When Jeffery questions her, she doesn't seem to know. She advises Jeffery to sneak into the woman's apartment and hides in her closet. The woman is an nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini). Furthermore, Jeffery learns that Vallens' husband is kidnapped and held up by her brutal and foul-mouthed captor named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Booth is brutal. He'll do anything to Vallens' Torture her, perform strange sex acts with her and even degrade her in front of public. Soon enough, Jeffery finds himself in a world where nothing is what it seems. The opening sequences of "Blue Velvet" are shot very beautifully. We see basically, a suburban landscape. White picket fences, Red roses, Friendly firemen waving to you, giving you an gleefully smile as they ride by, and even friendly neighbors that won't even bother you. The director, David Lynch, combines this tale with sharp story-telling skills. He begins this story with an inside look of Smalltown U.S.A. It's the kind of town that you would want to move into. But, as we learn about Lumberton, we then see a dramatic change. We learned that this particular town has some very nasty people living there. There's a sense of evil that is lurking in this town. We don't where it's coming from. But, we get an sense of what's happening here. The second thing that Lynch also brings up is the voyeurism in all of us. In that scene where Jeffery hides in Dorothy Vallens' closet, we get an sense of voyeurism, just like how Alfred Hitchcock presented voyeurism in Psycho. This time, Lynch really empathizes on small-town problems that are severely strange. It's strange to us why these problems don't occur out in public. As Jeffery digs deeper into his investigation, he soon realizes that this town also has an underworld to it, filled with very strange and bizarre characters, especially Frank. The thing that Frank represents, I think, is the sexual oppression of America. In other words, he is simply aroused by doing things that are unusual, but it's granted in his own mind. He gets aroused by inhaling amyl nitrite into his system, making him have spouts of rage toward Vallens. Vallens, however, enjoys being abused by Frank, but we don't know why she enjoys it. There are a lot of things that "Blue Velvet" stands for, instead of just being an title song, being sung by Bobby Vinton. I think it shows that even small towns can have an underworld too. Cities do have underworlds, too. But, small towns can have one, too. "Blue Velvet" is brilliant. It has a lot of power being put into the savage violence that Hopper's character possess. Not only by violence, but by the atmosphere that surrounds the movie itself. It's suffocating and relentless, but vivid. Lynch's direction is crisp and creates an dark atmosphere to his vision of a strange world being buried underneath an small town. Dennis Hopper is very convincing as Frank. He is one of the reasons why this movie works. We basically sit back and watch Hopper be angry at his victim. Hopper did received an Golden Globe nomination for his performance. But, I think he should've gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well. He is that great in the movie. The story telling is haunting and is well told. When the 1980's drew to a close, "Blue Velvet" was as being one of the top 10 best films of the decade. It definitely deserves it. The film gained cult status over the years, and even after 28 years, it still holds up. "It's a Strange World, Isn't It?" "Yes, it is." ★★★★ 4 stars. After hearing loads about this film, and seeing it pop up on so many 'Top 100' lists, I thought I'd give it a look. I'm not a massive David Lynch fan by any means, but his work certainly intrigues me. I love Twin Peaks, but was equally baffled by Lost Highway, but Blue Velvet seems to fall somewhere in the middle for me. It starts out rather promising, by showing 1950's American suburbia in a glowing light, before slowly descending into the dark underbelly. The use of the theme song is very effective here and proves rather creepy. However what follows in the mystery of the ear is all a bit hit and miss. This is definitely A linear story for Lynch, a director well known for his surreal dreamy films, however Blue Velvet didn't particularly thrill me or intrigue me. I found the film on the whole to be pretty dull. The performances on the otherhand are brilliant with the standout being Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rosselini on the other hand tends to be quite annoying at parts. The cinematography is great in the film showing plenty of contrasts between light and dark , and the music suits the film well. In conclusion a relatively dull mystery film that doesn't really carry with it any real thrills to keep the viewer invested. A 6/10 The gruesome discovery of a severed human ear he found in a field leads a young man (Kyle MacLachlan) on a dark and dangerous journey into a dark and sinister underworld that exists in his hometown.<br/><br/>This is a notice to Molly Ringwald's mother: if the rumors are true and you prevented Ringwald from appearing in this film, you probably single-handedly caused her career to fail. (Although "fail" is relative, seeing as she is still a household name.) Instead we get Laura Dern, the princess of an acting family (who today may be the best well-known of the bunch).<br/><br/>What about MacLachlan versus Val Kilmer? Was MacLachlan right for the role, or should Vilmer have gotten it? Frankly I am glad it went to MacLachlan. (Interestingly, the two appeared together in Oliver Stone's "The Doors") MacLachlan had previously appeared in Lynch's "Dune", but given the lack of following this was to be the film that sealed his fate (well, this and "Twin Peaks").<br/><br/>We have a little bit of Jack Nance (never enough) and a very strange Dean Stockwell. Is this Stockwell's best role? It certainly ranks among them, though he will always be known as "Al" from "Quantum Leap".<br/><br/>The thing about this film that makes it divisive, I think, is its length and self-indulgence. Lynch approaches film as a painter or artist rather than as someone who is interested in moving the plot forward. For some people, this can be a major turnoff and make the film boring. Indeed, you could easily trim 10 or more minutes out to keep things going. But that would not be a David Lynch film. In a way Blue Velvet was David Lynch's make or break moment. He had emerged on the scene with the ultra-strange art film Eraserhead, made his international reputation with the smash-hit The Elephant Man and then came unstuck with the flop Dune. Lynch had agreed with his Hollywood producers to make the latter with caveat that he should later be allowed to direct a film where he would have final cut. That film was Blue Velvet and if it failed his reputation would be shot and chances are he would struggle to get another opportunity at making a highly personal movie. As it was, it was a moderate commercial success and a huge critical one. So much so that it led to Lynch co-creating the television series Twin Peaks which not only further explored many of the ideas first touched on here but also signalled the zenith of his popularity. His reputation and style had connected with the wider culture.<br/><br/>While Blue Velvet is undoubtedly a very strange film in many ways, it is considerably less weird than all of Lynch's subsequent films, The Straight Story excepted. It seemed to be the clearest example of the director utilising a fairly coherent plot-line that essentially makes sense with a considerable amount of genuine strangeness. It's story takes the form of a neo-noir mystery about a young man who finds a severed ear; an event that leads him into a spiral of extremely dangerous events in which he is forced to confront hitherto unknown dark desires in the recesses of his mind. The film works very well as a mystery but it's the way that it's presented that makes it genius. Lynch is not simply interested in the puzzle that Jeffrey Beaumont tries to solve but also the mysteries that lie beneath the surface of every day normality – the dark sexual desire of a wholesome young man, depraved events happening behind the closed doors of a small American town and the fact that the neatly mown front lawns host chaotic worlds of insect violence. This subversion of audience expectations is what made Blue Velvet so striking and so disturbing.<br/><br/>The casting is very good. Kyle MacLachlan provides the right balance of innocence and inherent darkness. Isabella Rossellini is impressive in the tough role of the femme fatale/victim and Dean Stockwell is memorable as a flamboyant gangster who likes to mime along to 50's pop songs. But most striking is Dennis Hopper as the psychotic character Frank, in a very fearless and somewhat alarming performance. These guys hold the dramatics together but this is definitely a Lynch film first and foremost and he ensures that the atmosphere, mood and look is always potent. It's unique combination of the visually beautiful with the extremely sinister is very well executed. The cinematography looks fantastic and there is a very skillful use of colour. The overall effect is a very seductive film, one which suggested something completely new. Blue Velvet is an intoxicating concoction of several strange ideas and it remains a landmark movie. I have never known a director who does menace as well as Lynch. I don't mean fear and certainly not shocks or horror but just the sense that even the perfectly ordinary can and will turn into something distressing or unpleasant.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is, essentially, a film about this undertone of menace. Set in the 80s, when it was made, but in many ways harking back to the supposed suburban bliss of '50s and early '60s America this is a film that begins as it means to go on with a wholesome suburban father suffering some kind of attack whilst watering his lawn. We follow this with his son and the film's protagonist, Jeffery (played by Kyle McLachlan), investigating an intriguing mystery which draws him into an unpleasant world lurking just below the surface of his apparently-pleasant neighbourhood. The characters, and much of the dialogue, feels like they have stepped out of a wholesome 1961 US sitcom or soap opera: the families, Jeffery the enthusiastic young student, Sandy the pretty high-school girl who's already taken but who he develops a romantic interest in; even the police and coroner have an air of neighbourly wholesomeness. It's only when Jeffery becomes obsessed with investigating the home of local cabaret singer Dorothy Vallens that the ugly underside reveals itself. And it's very very ugly. The film's antagonist, Frank, played by a wild-eyed Dennis Hopper, is an unnerving and deeply unpleasant individual and many may find his first scene with Dorothy difficult to watch. The character and Hopper's performance feel like monsters invading Jeffery's 60s-esque suburbia and he draws them into a dark underworld populated by drug-dealing mobsters and corrupt cops. But Lynch doesn't just portray Frank as a mobster, he is a very strange man obsessed with sexual violence who associates with equally-strange people including, in one very memorable scene, underworld dandy Ben (played by Dean Stockwell) who mimes to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" in a scene as menacing as it is strange. Jeffery quickly discovers that his youthful intrigue has pulled him into a world he wanted to know nothing about and over the course of the film, much of those '50s and '60s "wholesome" tropes are not so much deconstructed as pushed-aside as Jeffery enters a disturbing relationship with Dorothy putting him in direct conflict with the dangerous Frank and threatening his growing relationship with Sandy.<br/><br/>Despite its reputation as a typically weird Lynch film this is actually one of his more conventional works. It has a clear protagonist, a clear antagonist, a moral message and even a happy ending. Yet like much of his work it feels surreal, dark and mysterious in a way that many other films tackling similar subject matter rarely do. The film starts with a slow plot and pacing. Since it involves Lynch, we should better be prepared to see something extraordinary. Till halftime it was not sure as to what he is trying to say. However the film picks up pace from the middle and becomes very much compelling in the end. The story revolves around a teenage boy who finds an ear. He has an inquisitive nature and because of this he witnesses a lot of things which got him into a lot of troubles. Like other films of lynch, this one does provide a surrealism nature but it is not too much obscure like that of Eraserhead. In all this is a nice experimenting film that opens doors to new thoughts.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: "Dare to do."<br/><br/>VERDICT: "A recommended watch for film buffs." In my opinion, 'Blue Velvet' is one of, if not the, finest film(s) I have ever seen. I came to this realization when thinking, as a natural critic always does, how I would change it if I had access to a time-machine and information with which to blackmail David Lynch, and found that I couldn't come up with anything. Well, no, the symbolism was a tad bit transparent in the final scene, but aside from that this movie was absolutely fantastic. It was brilliantly shot and acted - the plot was simplistic, but that hardly mattered when it was supported by such a script. The films motifs worked brilliantly and Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack worked amazingly with it. I was not troubled by the obscene content of the film and frankly find people who are critical of it for that reason alone annoying. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Blue Velvet is altogether a juxtaposition, a working of normal Rockwellian America into the bizarre and the macabre. That element is what makes Lynch's film so original in its approach. Most films relish small-town America, this film shows us the hidden world just underneath its surface. The film possesses the raw violent and erotic energy of a locomotive, with some shocking scenes with enough energy in them to power a town. Hopper gives one of his greatest performances and Rossellini takes the biggest risk of her career in her role as a masochistic singer. Lynch creates for us two perpendicular worlds in the same plane and when he intersects them, his artistry is profound and the hypnotism of his film is unmatched. David Lynch is easily among the most uniquely talented and fascinating of directors working today. He is a truly unfiltered artist who puts all his fascinations, fears and inspirations down on film - for better or for worse.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a truly unique movie. It unfolds like the most psychotic, deranged Hardy Boys mystery ever written - and also recalls some of the same feelings and moods as other movies like Vertigo and The Night of the Hunter. But ultimately, there's no way to really describe the peculiar, mesmerizing poetry of Blue Velvet. I do have my issues with this movie that hold me back from loving it unreservedly, but I do think that it's one of cinema's unforgettable masterpieces.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet seems to encapsulate the worldview of Lynch films - both the Lynch that loves compassion and humble decency (seen in The Elephant Man and The Straight Story) and the Lynch that is both horrified and turned on by utter depravity (seen in Wild at Heart, Lost Highway and Inland Empire). Blue Velvet straddles the two sides of Lynch's artistic personality. This movie goes darker and deeper into human evil and cruelty than most others dare. Certain eerie tableaux from Blue Velvet will forever be carved in my mind - Lynch does undeniably have a gift for showing how inhuman and grotesque people can become when they give in to their most deeply selfish, dark impulses. Dennis Hopper's character is like an unfiltered icon of human evil in all its horror, irrationality and childish stupidity. Yet, unlike many movies that uncover evil hiding in suburbia (such as American Beauty), Blue Velvet seems to really believe in the purity and goodness of its suburban utopia. Laura Dern's character represents basic human decency - she comes across as naive, but proves herself to be brave, genuine and compassionate.<br/><br/>If Hopper is pure evil and Dern is pure goodness, than Kyle MacMachlan's character Jeffrey could be seen as Lynch's alter-ego. He admires Dern's decency, but is overly fascinated and a little seduced by the evil he witnesses. Lynch seems to have the same struggle. He does love goodness, but is also intoxicated by the twisted, dark realms of human nature. In fact, my main problem with Blue Velvet is that Lynch gets too turned on by his own disturbing imaginings. Good does triumph over evil by the end of Blue Velvet, but the scenes of evil (an extended rape scene in particular) are uncomfortably eroticized in their presentation. This is my main issue with Blue Velvet, and it's not a small one. Nevertheless, despite loving its own perversions a bit too much, this is an artistic masterwork - one with memorable characters, bold performances, and Lynch's typical knack for creating unforgettably surreal situations and images. "Go to sleep, everything is alright." - Roy Orbinson <br/><br/>The cinematic equivalent of a son walking in on his father masturbating, David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" opens with the picturesque amalgamation of 1950s and early 60s Americana, complete with white picket fences, red fire engines and a crooning Bobby Vinton. It's this idyllic image which is shattered when a young Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) peeks behind the "blue velvet", that fluttering curtain which shields the naivety of youth from maturity and much transgression.<br/><br/>Lynch once described "Blue Velvet" as "The Hardy Boys Go To Hell". Indeed, for most of its running time "Blue Velvet" proceeds as a fairly light hearted boy's adventure, our pint-sized noir detective investigating "the case of the severed ear", a case which eventually introduces our hero to a world of murder, drugs, kidnapping, torture, sex, sadness and Pabst Blue Ribbon (Fck you Heineken!). Significantly, Jeffery's father's heart attack – Jeffery's own first encounter with mortality - is what begins our young hero's indoctrination into this dark new world. But it's a world Jeffery wants to be part of. He's seduced by what lies behind Lynch's velvety blue curtain.<br/><br/>Much of the film's second act involves Jeffery's encounters with two characters, Dorothy Vallens and Frank Booth, played by Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper respectively. Dorothy (her name recalling "The Wizard of Oz's" famous world hopper) forces herself upon Jeffery, her means of reclaiming some power after having been violated by Jeffery's intrusion into her home. This sex act is interrupted by Booth, who proceeds to rape Dorothy whilst a hidden Jeffery watches from a cupboard. The scene is a projection of the boy's own desire to be in sexual control; to turn the tables back on Dorothy. <br/><br/>From here on, Lynch spends much of "Blue Velvet" drawing parallels between Booth and Jeffery. Both Booth and Jeffery are turned on by Dorothy's rendition of Bobby Vinton's Blue Velvet, the film is bookended by shots in which Lynch's camera tunnels into ears (suggesting that the entire film exists "between the ears", within Jeffery's own twisted mind-space), and Jeffrey increasingly begins to act like Booth, particularly in his sexual relationship with Dorothy. <br/><br/>The film's final act involves Jeffrey killing Booth and restoring some measure of "normalcy" to his life. The monster has been slain, the sun shines once again, and he proceeds (we assume) to marry Sandy, the blonde haired apple of his eye. Always, however, Booth sleeps repressed within Jeffrey and Dorothy within Sandy. <br/><br/>And so like many of Lynch's films, "Blue Velvet" is about what happens when innocence turns into experience, when imagination turns into a reality, when one enters a situation where one can actually realise one's own darkest desires, as well as the pain and terror that come with them. It's about man's interior and exterior, the outer life and the inner, the well-ordered suburban society and the severed ear out in the woods, the perfectly manicured green lawns and the night-crawlers lurking below - and the relation all these things have to do with each other. The good boy Jeffrey Beaumont wants good girl Sandy, but like the monstrous Booth, he also desires Dorothy, a woman who seemingly exists to be possessed and abused. Jeffrey may defeat Frank, but he also finds he has to be like him as well, because for Dorothy love is, at some level, violence. <br/><br/>The film ends with Lynch's camera panning from a blue sky to a fluttering blue curtain, a powerful shot which echoes and reverses the film's introduction. Spookily, the curtain's velvety folds await their next victim.<br/><br/>Still, "Blue Velvet" always was somewhat overrated. Jeffrey spying on Booth's dry humping sessions cause no shocks in a world in which little kids become addicted to the most graphic pornography imaginable and mass murders are green-lit without the bat of an eyelid. Lynch's clean demarcations between "night" and "day", between "idyll" and "hell" (poles which seem far more extreme today), are also much less nuanced and challenging than his subsequent features. As a comparison see Cronenberg's "A History of Violence" (it's a less clear cut version of "Blue Velvet"; see also "Eyes Wide Shut"), in which a family's idyllic yearnings and darker desires all overlap. Here, all fantasies are shown to be untangleable, inextricable, and the family's desires all aim to re-establish, sometimes to the point of psychotic hallucination, something either irretrievable or never really possessed.<br/><br/>Aesthetically "Blue Velvet" represents, arguably, Lynch's best use of colour, Lynch using saturated reds (roses, lipstick, fire-engines etc), blues and blacks. His other trademarks are on display: a disquieting mood, 1950's crooners used to unsettling effect (Roy Orbinson and Bobby Vinton, recalling Kubrick's use of Al Bowlly and Henry Hall), a focus on doors, doorways, openings, entrances and exists (always suggestive of secret, hidden, repressed or off-limit realms), seemingly innocuous dialogue with a perverted/comedic tinge ("Bits and pieces", "I hear things", references to "Van Gogh" etc) and a somewhat satirical take on the usual trinkets of Americana. On the downside, his "symbolism" here is less deft than his subsequent films; literal heart attacks mirrored to literal shots of stalking killers on TV, a blunt use of churches, Jeffrey learning of all the "bugs" hidden in his town and later posing as a "bug exterminator" etc.<br/><br/>The film has been compared to early noirs, but it also recalls 1950's and early 60s melodramas (Sirk, Nick Ray, "Lolita", "Peyton's Place"), in which the suburbs and the "all American family" are either satirized or made to expose their dark underbellies. Hitchcock, a lover of blurring the lines between normalcy and perversion, is also a huge influence, particularly "Psycho". Hitchcock's success rested on a realisation that everyone in his audience is a deviant. Sandy says something similar to Jeffery herself: "I can't figure out if you're a detective or a pervert."<br/><br/>8/10 – Too easy. Worth one viewing. A bit of amateur sleuthing is always good value, but put it in the hands of someone like David Lynch and you'll get something very different. After having had this one recommended to me by several people I decided to give it a viewing when it came up on TV recently. I have to admit, it's pretty good very strange in places, but still, very watchable and very compelling. But more of my thought later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please hide in that closet while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Young Jeffrey Beaumont comes across a human ear in a field near his home. Being a responsible type, he takes it to a policeman he knows, Detective Williams. The detective looks into the matter and later tells Jeffrey that he cannot discuss the case but he will tell him everything after the investigation. Jeffrey is not satisfied with this and is determined to find out more. Detective William's daughter, Sandy, tells Jeffery that she overheard her father say that a woman called Dorothy Vallens may be involved. The pair decides to try and find some evidence. Sneaking into her apartment and hiding in a closet, Jeffery discovers more than he bargained for when a violent and shady character called Frank Booth turns up. I will leave my short summary here I think that's enough to intrigue you for now.<br/><br/>A very well made film with some great moments and also some totally strange moments. I found it very compelling and also quite bizarre in places. Great performances all round, particularly from Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth; he really gets to chew all the scenery in this one! Also worthy of note is Isabella Rossellini as Dorothy Vallens, again, a stellar performance. Kyle MacLachlan was excellent as Jeffrey Beaumont, as was Laura Dern as Sandy Williams. I should also give an honourable mention to Dean Stockwell who I hardly recognised as Ben.<br/><br/>As I've already said, this is a very compelling film with lots of quite strange and bizarre touches. I liked it a lot, but found the whole tone rather muted which, I felt, took away some of the impact of it. I would definitely watch it again though because I'm sure there are many nuances I missed first time around. Over all, it's a very compelling story told it a way that is, at times, quite bizarre, but even so, very enjoyable Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.6/10 Woah. That's all I have to say about this movie. Whatever you might expect from this film, chances are it's completely wrong. It is an experience unlike anything you've ever seen the likes of. But such is the case of David Lynch. In 35 years he has proved himself to be the master of surreal subjective filmmaking. He has created art in some of the most bizarre and unique ways imaginable. Blue Velvet is no exception. The film is set in a quiet suburban neighborhood that seems innocent enough on the surface, but has a dark and seedy underbelly where pure evil lurks. It all begins when Jeffrey Beaumont find a severed ear in his backyard. He reports the ear to the police but quickly becomes impatient with their progress. He takes matters into his own hands and uncovers a mystery surrounding a strange and sensual night club singer and a sadomasochistic psychopath. Be prepared for one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>In Blue Velvet David Lynch takes filmmaking to the next level. There are tons of odd nuances in this film that give it a strange and offbeat feel, but in reality every nuance has some sort of deep meaning that relates to the dark and surreal themes of the film. The film starts out relatively normal. We are treated to an interesting little setting in a plain suburban town. As the film progresses the mystery begins to unfold and while it may seem plain and generic at first, it quickly dives off the deep end into a dark pit of horror and desperation. They mystery grows stranger and more harrowing and the visual flare emphasizes the dark eroticism the movie develops around.<br/><br/>The point where the film really becomes more than just another mystery story is the introduction of Dennis Hopper's character, Frank Booth. I'm not sure you could find a more maniacally disturbed personification of evil in cinema. The character of Frank Booth makes the film difficult to watch which of course makes the film all the more memorable. It is one of Hopper's greatest performances and one of his most daring roles to take on. If you can find me a more despicable character that could actually exist I will be amazed. This film centers a lot around dark evil that hides under an innocent facade the unsuspecting world covers it with, and without Dennis Hopper playing the deplorable Frank Booth, Blue Velvet would be missing a lot.<br/><br/>I've only seen this film once but I can definitely say that it is one that must be watched many multiple times. I tried to pick up on as much as possible my first go-round, which wasn't easy while you're trying to follow the story itself at the same time. Plus, a lot of the unique nuances the film possesses are things very open to interpretation, as per most David Lynch films. I look forward to giving this film another watch to truly experience all of the disturbing uniqueness it has to offer.<br/><br/>David Lynch is an auteur and a genius. He does with films what abstract and subjective artists do with their paintings. He creates such unique visions and portrayals of the world in his films. Blue Velvet is one of the most unique cinema experiences I've ever had. And it isn't just unique in its style of filming, but unique in ever aspect possible. The story, while conventional on the outside has so many dark subtexts to it that are fascinating to read into. You have to watch this film with an open mind and you can't expect things to be spelled out or clearly defined for you. You must be prepared to interpret and think. There's a lot to be said for a film that can do that, and can do it well so that it doesn't seem pretentious or self important. Blue Velvet is that film and while my first viewing provided shock, awe, and plenty of confusion, I can't wait to watch it again. One of the greatest aspects of this film is the way that it peels back the surface of what appears to be real to show something much seamier, darker, more perverse underneath. While one can view the story straightforwardly--a young man finds a severed ear in a field, it leads to strange encounters, including with a beautiful, troubled, abused woman (Isabella Rosselini in superb form) and the very embodiment of evil (one of Dennis Hopper's top performances), and things take off from there--at a deeper level it dramatizes a vital metaphor for the world around us.<br/><br/>The often seemingly-placid surface of things is only that, a screen or scrim; whether in a city, the suburbs, or the town in which this film is set, a great deal simmers, seethes even, below the surface. The film's protagonist, Kyle MacLachlan's character Jeffrey Beaumont, does what many of us dare not, to investigate and dig deeper. Most of the time in our lives the results may not amount to much, but as Jeffrey finds out, sometimes real danger and horror lies ahead, and a severed ear should just be handed off to the police and not become the spark for trying to learn more.<br/><br/>Ultimately the film suggests that the payoff is rarely what we think, though we do end up learning something, about the world beneath the world of appearances, and about ourselves, and for that, as well as its thrilling plot, great acting, and singular strangeness, which caused a stir when it premiered, "Blue Velvet" is worth seeing, and more than once. Ever since its release in 1986, David Lynch's most controversial and well-known film "Blue Velvet" has been the culprit responsible for a ravaging intellectual disputation in the realm of the cinema. I've yet to find an intelligent, knowledgeable moviegoer or critic who would slam its production values, because they are undeniably keen under Lynch's mastery. What has sparked such a firestorm is the movie's explicit and sometimes appalling content, both ostensibly and symbolically. The key example was the long-running dispute between Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. There is no right or wrong answer to any movie in terms of whether it is good or bad, a masterpiece or a clunk o' junk, but there seems to be little consensus about "Blue Velvet."<br/><br/>As the movie opens up, it turns out that the hospitalization of the father of our lead character (Kyle MacLachlan) is merely the plot's excuse to bring him to an open field, where he discovers a severed human ear. After bringing his discovery to the authorities, MacLachlan and the daughter of a detective (a very young Laura Dern) embark on a personal mission. When a trail of assumptions leads them to a night club singer (Isabella Rossellini) whose husband and son have disappeared, MacLachlan discovers that the nice little town he grew up in is not such a paradise after all. That there is a sick and perverted underworld to it, personified and imbued with evil by a perverted drug addict.<br/><br/>The villain is played by the late Dennis Hopper in what may be the greatest performance that magnificent towering figure of acting talent ever gave. Hopper's character Frank Booth is one of the most sickening, repulsive, and unpleasant characters ever put on screen. Whereas Norman Bates was frightening, yet somehow sympathetic, you condemn this narcotic-addicted monster from the very beginning. And it is his character and the way he sexually and psychologically imprisons the Isabella Rossellini character that is a key symbol about society and human beings in the picture.<br/><br/>David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is, once examined psychically, much more than a horror story or even a satire. It is a rich and traumatizing accurate analysis of what we have come to labeled as civilization. It opens up with a pleasant, heart-warming sight of a nice little town and then embarks you on a nightmarish journey, discovering some of the most unpleasant and revolting character relationships as well as some sweet and charming ones as well. Lynch is not being entirely nihilistic in "Blue Velvet"; he is just showing us both sides of the coin. However, like an F can be more significant on a report card than an A+, he leaves more impact with the bad sides of his view even though he will have to reward us eventually. At least we assume that he must.<br/><br/>But what I found most compelling about "Blue Velvet," still days later after seeing it for the first time and holding it in my mind for so long, is the network of relationships between the characters. In particular, the relationship between Kyle MacLachlan and Isabella Rossellini is one of the more heart-warming and transfixing, if odd, friendships ever put on camera. It commences with some riveting setups that would have made Alfred Hitchcock nod in approval, and then, as he might have done so with this material, warps it into something rather beautiful and unique. There is also a very strong chemistry between MacLachlan and Laura Dern and that has plenty of power to develop the sense of being lost and confused in our protagonist. Some might consider the picture misogynic for the way that Isabella Rossellini's character is seemingly brutalized and humiliated toward the end of the picture, but I don't see that as the case. Sure, she is a victim, but more of a victim, I think, of society's way of tolerating scum like Frank Booth.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is also a great film because it has the same effect on a lot of people as it did to me: it makes you think. It makes you ponder about what it means and what the director David Lynch was trying to point out and force upon us. And like any work that takes that approach, the interpretations will be insurmountable. I can fully understand the harsh negative reactions that have been thrown upon this picture over the years, but I cannot help but side with the opposing view that it is really some kind of a masterpiece. There has not been much of an in-between reaction to "Blue Velvet" and the newcomers to it like myself are very much in the same battle. You will either love it or you will hate it...and for the exact same reasons. I can't quite figure out what makes this film so good, other than Dennis Hopper, who does bats**t crazy better than anyone ever did or ever will. Dean Stockwell is a scene stealer, Isabella Rossellini is great, but Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are...well, just meh. There's a lot of typical David Lynch weird-for-the-sake-of-weird stuff, but once that gets stripped away, there's not much left. I saw that the film was originally supposed to be four hours; two hours was plenty for me. <br/><br/>All in all, I don't see what the fuss is about. There are better out there, however it's worth watching if nothing more that watching the late Dennis Hopper go over the top as Frank. A great example of film noir from the 80's, but not one of my favorites. "Blue Velvet" was my second foray into Lynch, following my positive experience with "Mulholland Drive." Where "MD" was a WOW experience, "BV" totally destroyed my idea of what movies can do and rebuilt it again, bigger, better, and more powerful than before. Rarely will a movie stick with you like "BV," haunting your waking thoughts, even if you didn't like it. Rarely can a movie look like a work of art while communicating a point not necessarily original but definitely done in a new way. "BV" is a masterpiece of cinema in every sense of that word. Young Jeffrey, played by Kyle MacLachlan, arrives in his small hometown of Lumberton, USA from college after his father suffers a heart attack. While walking around his neighborhood, he finds a human ear in a field, and being the fine, upstanding citizen he is, he takes it to the police. After talking with the detective assigned to the case, Jeffrey meets his young, high-school aged daughter (a fresh-faced Laura Dern, nary 18 when this film was shot). They hatch a plan to investigate the ear case, and Jeffrey ends up in the apartment of Isabella Rossellini, and begins to discover a horrific circle of drugs, violence, and sexual deviancy surrounding the psychotic Frank (played to perfection by Dennis Hopper). Jeffrey's world unravels as he finds himself in over his head in something he doesn't understand.<br/><br/>Although not as shocking today as it was in 1986, "BV" is highly charged, tackling taboo, closed-door issues without batting an eyelash. It isn't as weird as "MD," but "BV" still has that Lynchian feel of otherworldliness about it; Lumberton is a mirror-image of many small towns, and one must wonder if this isn't what's going on behind the neighbor's closed doors. That being said, "BV" isn't for everyone. It's not artsy-fartsy like "City of Lost Children," nor is it conventional cinema in any sense of that term. It's something unto itself, and for those that don't like Lynch's style, there won't be much of redeeming value in this film. It's cinema that requires attention and thought, and it engages the audience as much as any book or painting could - and that's saying something. The acting is all top-notch, from MacLachlan's sharply divided protagonist to Dern's almost symbolic portrayal of the "normal," to Rossellini's abused woman at the end of her rope, to Hopper's out-and-out, but believable, evil sociopath. Add to that Lynch's attention to detail, and "BV" is, in a literal sense, a perfect film.<br/><br/>Lynch may not be for everyone. If you haven't experienced Dave yet, "Blue Velvet" would make an excellent introduction. Rent "BV" before you buy it, but if you like it, this disc needs to be in your collection. Like, now. If you haven't seen it, I, well, really feel sorry for you. Blue Velvet is seen by many critics as representing a modern-day perspective of film-noir, or "neo-noir", present in many thriller films from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s. A young man (Kyle MacLachlan) in a small town finds a severed ear and , in trying to track its owner, finds himself entangled in murder, perversion and ways of life he never imagined.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the film is a classic: white picket fences, smiling small-town firemen waving from their truck, a man tending his garden. But then he suffers a stroke, the camera dips below ground, and we see teeming insect life under the lawn. It's a perfect metaphor for what is to come: a young man playing amateur sleuth and ending up on the dark side of town. Dennis Hopper is superb as the local criminal mastermind (complete with inhaler) while Isabella Rossellini suffers for her art as his bruised chanteuse girlfriend. A shocking, confident, stylish piece of work, and for aspiring screenwriters, maybe the seminal film of the 1980s: certainly director David Lynch's notion of weirdness and malice lurking behind the cheery face of small towns has since been thoroughly explored. This 1986 film, written and directed by David Lynch, is a real shocker. It takes a small town mystery and turns it into a film noir. The images are violent and sadistic. The story is weak. And the plot confused. At the end, I still wasn't sure what happened. And yet, it had a fascination to it and I just couldn't stop watching. There's young Kyle MacLachlan, newly home from college, who finds a severed ear in the woods. There's Laura Dern as his blonde and blue-eyed girlfriend whose father is a cop. There's Isabella Rossellini as a sultry nightclub singer with secrets galore. And then there is Dennis Hopper as and cruel sicko who abuses Rossellini. The acting is fine. And the story kept me interested. And yet it let me down. Because by the time I watched it all the way through I still wasn't sure of the plot.<br/><br/>Rather, I came away with a feeling. One that haunted my dreams last night. It's isn't pleasant. But it goes to show just how far a director can go in films. And David Lynch sure did break boundaries in this one. By the end of the film I felt I was myself a victim of his violence against the audience. But, in spite of all its faults I rather liked it simply for its outrageousness and willingness to break boundaries. Recommended only for the brave few. How many movies are you going to see that use a bird eating a bug as an illustration that a young man should be afraid of acting on sexual feelings, because those desires are seen as disdainful and shameful to a good-minded society? The bird appears to be a robin. The very type of bird used to analogize goodness and pure love in the movie. Classic. "Sometimes a wind blows and the mysteries of love come clear". Tweet, tweet. For this movie we live inside a strange world. For Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me we live inside a dream. For Mulholland Dr. we live inside one person's dream. I doubt that Lynch will be making any action/adventure or romantic comedies anytime soon.<br/><br/>A good boy's bad-boy libido fantasy compared against idealistic pure love, with 1950's America mentality. The movie deals mostly with a young man moralizing sexual desires. Contrasting, and in the end somewhat reconciling, moral extremes is a staple in Lynch movies. The evil side has some legitimate allurement, the viewer always gets a very generous taste of it. Also pervasive, always there lurking behind the doors. But ultimately however that side should be dismissed out of fear, fear of physical and emotional repercussions. And also dismissed out of love, respect of the morally acceptable. The larger point is probably that human beings are a mix of good and evil, or that human beings are indelibly flawed. Accentuating the good side more strongly might have made for more emotional buildup in Blue Velvet, as in Mulholland Dr. and Fire Walk With Me (the two grandiose behemoths). Though those two have tragic endings that work better in contrasting dramatically against the good. Also in those two there is more focus on the female characters, characters easily perceived as more vulnerable, needing protection, especially after you have seen them naked numerous times (I know, sexist white male propaganda to keep the white female down). In Blue Velvet, the "Why are there people like Frank..." and the "robins...love", "Mommy loves you", the caring family, the loving slow dance are somewhat muted examples of moral conscientiousness. Somewhat muted, given you have people dancing on car tops, singing into shop lights, lewd mommy/daddy/baby Oedipal references, and toasts made to f...... (All very entertaining). A "goodness" point will be made. And after you mull that for two seconds, there is a heap of weirdness, and that is followed by some more disorderedness. Always some consternation caused by seeing the evil in the world. Also troubling when one sees some of that evil in one's own thoughts. This recognition and repulsion however may qualify you as somewhat moral, having some goodness. This is seemingly the key moral point, as well as, implicitly, the message that morality has importance on a personal, individual basis. But that isn't quite it. Yes, the moral person, say a moral hormone-filled young man trying to reconcile his biology, has some significant awareness that there is some wrongness about himself (has at the least a keen knowledge that one's sexuality is socially problematic) and is cognizant that there is wrongness in the world around him. But to some degree that is done out of pragmatism, to save one's self in a larger society. Not really all that noble, perhaps only marginally moral. So the conclusion is more that people are perverts, including one's self. It's a strange world, isn't it? What can be said that hasn't already been said countless times before about a film like this? The brutally honest performances, articulate and beautiful style, and the movie's sexual and violent shock value save the story from becoming too stale or uninspiring. Blue Velvet, all these years later, still seems completely original, invigorating and unsurpassed. It wouldn't matter if every film after Blue Velvet in David Lynch's career sucked, because Blue Velvet will always be his masterpiece. The things, along with Twin Peaks, will remember him for.<br/><br/>Everyone assumes that Blue Velvet opens with the infamous ear-in-the-grass scene, but the film's opening is even more disturbing than that. A suburban fantasia of white picket fences, blood-red roses, waving fireman, happy children and a man watering his lawn gives way to the disturbing moment when the watering man collapses and the camera pans down to dirt level where a number of horrific insects are scrabbling in the dirt at the base of the lawn. The soundtrack changes from Leave It to Beaver-style music to the loud, gnawing, electric saw-like noises emitted by the creatures. Only subsequent to this scene does Jeffrey Beaumont (a wide-eyed, snoopy Kyle MacLachlan) find the ear in a field of overgrown weeds.<br/><br/>The ear leads Jeffrey through a sordid underworld involving kidnapping, masochism, drug-dealing, and murder. But while there's a whole lot of plot in Blue Velvet, Lynch's more elemental concern is with unearthing the truth behind the façade (i.e. showing what lurks under the lawn). Even the blue velvet dress that chanteuse Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rossellini) wears hides a secret -- namely, the bruises on her body which are delivered by the vile Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper, in the role that brought him back to the limelight).<br/><br/>When Jeffrey asks the niave Sandy (Laura Dern), the prim girl on whom he has a crush, why there is so much trouble in the world, the answer is clear -- without it, our lives would be far duller. Jeffrey himself admits that he loves a mystery and the curiosity that his desire entails is the same one that fuels Lynch's own vision. When Frank says to Jeffrey, "You're like me," it could be Lynch speaking to the audience. We want to know more, even if what we find out hurts or is ugly. Like the scene of an accident, we cannot look away. Fueled by a vibrant and always-surprising surrealism, Blue Velvet reminds us that the dreams and fantasies of our subconscious are dangerous and thrilling; it's surface reality that is mundane.<br/><br/>This is definitely a film worth watching multiple times. It gets better and better on every viewing. There are so many questions, and at the same time, so many answers, which seem to bring up more questions. Blue Velvet is a timeless, unmissible film. Let it be known that David Lynch has a very unique style; a style that is a very acquired taste. You either love him or you hate him; there is rarely an in-between. I personally love his work (most of it), which is what saddens me a bit about 'Blue Velvet'. This is one of those films that is lauded above all his other work as being the best of the best, but it struck me a little cold. The script is flawless (I love the ambiguities that lie within Lynch's work) and the direction, pace and mood acquired is effortlessly captivating, but the film falls short in a very central area; the acting.<br/><br/>Don't pelt me with stones just yet.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Jeffrey Beaumont, a young man who returns to his hometown after his father falls ill suddenly. Upon his return he finds a severed ear in a field and his journey then begins. With local high school girl Sandy (whose father happens to be the Detective Jeffrey shows the ear to) Jeffrey decides to try and uncover the mystery behind the ear, and this attempt brings him into the lives of quite a few interesting people. First there is Dorothy Vallens, a beautiful woman who is victim to a strange and violent man named Frank Booth; and sliding into their lives, Jeffrey finds himself in desperate need for help as he watches his life slide further and further towards its end.<br/><br/>Lynch, like I mentioned, has a unique style of direction. If you are familiar with 'Eraserhead' or 'Mulholland Drive' then you already know how this film is going to progress. He allows the scenes to move at their own pace, manipulating them just slightly. This may come off to some as dry or even stale, but this is Lynch's way of using everything at his disposal to create a mood, an air within each scene.<br/><br/>I have no problem with this.<br/><br/>The script is also brilliantly done. The slow progression of junior detective is effective and consuming as we anticipate how things are going to turn out for Jeffrey. We are interested in his relationship with Dorothy, and especially Sandy. We want to know how these two women are going to affect the outcome of his life, and we are terrified at the revelations about to be revealed by the repulsive Frank Booth.<br/><br/>I adore these aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned, the only fault I have with 'Blue Velvet' is the acting, and not as a whole but in parts. I'll start with the good. Isabella Rossellini is a stunning woman who really uses everything within her to create a woman of believable desperation. She is conflicted in every scene, and this is scene marvelously. We can see each fragment of her dissension into chaos. Laura Dern is even more splendid. She delivers such a richly honest performance as young Sandy, fascinated by each new discovery, no matter how terrifying it winds up being for her. But as great as these two actresses are, the film starts to crumble when left up to the men. Dennis Hopper (who actually received praise for his performance) is just one gigantic gimmick. He never really transcends his characters stereotypes. He's a crazy psychopath, nothing more. He delivered (the same year) a wonderfully controlled performance in 'Hoosiers' that I am disappointed he wasn't able to control this a little more. That said, he is still much more interesting than Kyle MacLachlan who may very well be the most boring actor since Keanu Reeves. I just really wish that someone, anyone else would have landed this role. MacLachlan just killed the high the film as a whole effectively sets.<br/><br/>All this said, I am fond of this film. It has so much going for it, and Lynch is just such a unique and original director who always stays true to himself. There are very few films like this one, and the ones that come close are also directed by Lynch. This is not a film for everyone, but if you are a fan of Lynch then this is a film you are bound to enjoy. Blue Velvet is an overpowering look at the evil that lurks amongst the normalities of everyday life. Boiled down to the basics, Blue Velvet is a good-guys vs. bad-guys crime thriller with sexual overtonnes, but if you want to get deep and philosophical, the movie is really about the evil that lurks beneath all of us.<br/><br/>You don't think that a film can be carried all the way through by one actor, think again. Dennis Hopper gives the most electrifying, twisted, and ultimately nauseating and corrosive performance in Frank Booth, the ultimate embodiment of evil. While he shouts for us not to "f****** look at him," we are transfixed by the grotesqueness and overall power of his character, like slowing down to watch a car accident. Lynch is a master of the art -- my favorite scene has go to be when Booth takes McLachlan to a field, puts lipstick on himself, then proceeds to kiss McLauchlan while one of the gang's girls dances atop a car to "Candy-Colored Clown." A truly one-of-a-kind, daring, original, and unforgettable glimpse into the dark cracks of American suburbia which we are too afraid to peer into. I wonder how David Lynch's family felt when she saw this story pour out of her darling son's mind. If she's anything like David himself, I'm sure she was extremely proud. Lynch made one of the best films of the 1980s when he completed Blue Velvet. This is one of those movies that is so powerful and visually stunning that you can't help but involve yourself with it's sick and strangely motivated characters. When watching this you will cringe, you will grind your teeth, and you will find yourself with a disturbed look on your face...and Lynch wouldn't want it any other way.<br/><br/>This film is a fusion of neo-noir style, art-house poetry, heart-stopping suspense, and sadistic erotica. It's not for all tastes, but should be viewed by anyone who's willing to give up two hours and think for a little while. What does Lynch have to say about society today? Not much that is positive, let me tell you. But he doesn't shove it in your face, he lets the viewer determine how he feels through examining the actions of the characters caught in the web of criminal activity and violent sexuality that the film offers. You may not be smiling after watching this movie, but I do promise you two things: 1) You will NEVER forget the movie 2) You will have nightmares in which Dennis Hopper stars as an antagonist. His role is so startling and demanding that you may find yourself staring at him in awe. To prepare yourself for Blue Velvet, try viewing the gentler Lynch opus The Elephant Man, or the original cult classic, Eraserhead. Small town America was never so terrifying... Never have I seen a film so visually arresting and beautiful, the intense colours almost speak to you. While some scenes are dark and repulsive, they remain beautiful and arresting at the same time.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an American underground classic, which was made in 1986 by a surrealist director David Lynch. One can admire it or denounce as a perverse theater of cruelty. The film is all about juxtaposed opposites. For starters, it features a music score based on the music of the Russian classical composer Dmitri Shostakovich, juxtaposed against American rock-and-roller Roy Orbison, which is a unique combination.<br/><br/>The main character of the movie - Jeffrey Beaumont - moves between two incompatible worlds: on the one side, the adolescent world of small town USA in the 50s with its high school and drugstore culture; and a violent, sex-crazed world of drugs, dementia and sexual perversion on the other.<br/><br/>Incidentally, David Lynch is very much admired in Europe. In fact, most of his movies have been financed by the French. I think the French admire Lynch because of his usage of double-layers of meaning in his cinematic language and use of Freudian themes. For example, in the movie the yellow man - one of the characters is identified through the yellow suite he wears - a yellow-jacket is a type of wasp, which is on WASP -white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. There is a Freudian theme, of course - the triangle between Dorothy Vallens (played by Ingrid Bergman's daughter Isabella Rossellini), Jeffrey Beaumont and Frank (played by Dennis Hopper) is an Oedipal (mother-father-son) triangle.<br/><br/>In one of the central scenes the hero -Jeffrey - watches through a fissure in the closet door the sadomasochistic sexual play between Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper, games in which Hopper relates to Rossellini alternatively as his mother and his daughter. As Slavoj Zizek has pointed out in one of his books, this is the pure *original fantasy* or the fantasy of origins. He notes that the game is the *subject* of the topic, the content of the fantasy, whereas its object is the hero himself reduced to the presence of a pure gaze. The basic paradox of the fantasy consist in this (nonsensical) temporal short circuit where the subject (as pure gaze) precedes itself and whiteness its own origin. I highly recommend this film for everybody interested in psychoanalyses and non-traditional Hollywood cinema. You could have so many arguments about Blue Velvet to the point of getting into a fist fight. Personally, I think it's the best movie ever made. It changed my whole perception of a film. The surreal opening sequence with the picket fence with Bobby Vinton's "Blue Velvet" (re-mixed by Lynch, sounding distant and bumped up from B-flat to B), may be the most beautiful few seconds of film one could see. Anyway, this film divided the critics, and that's why I love it.<br/><br/>If you were to ask me what kind of movie Blue Velvet is, I'd say, beautiful, disturbing, uniquely funny, suspenseful. Lynch creates two worlds here, with two girls, and a young man who is the arbitrator of the two who loses his innocence. With Laura Dern, you could turn your TV set to Black and White and think the film was made in the 50s (aside from Jeffery's ear-ring and hip 80s haircut). When Dorothy and Frank enter the picture, it's just...unbelievable. This is ground breaking cinema. No picture has ever boasted so much of a contrast between day and night, good and evil. No film has been made like this, and ever will be. Much symbolism well classifies the film as an contemporary art. Love it or leave it. It will always be talked about. Bravo, Lynch. You've changed my whole perception of cinema and my outlook on small towns. See it. You won't forget it. David Lynch in this film is typically himself : initiation of young people to the dark side of society, the rotten apples in the police institution, the artistic cult of darkness in the pictures, suffering as a lifestyle for some women who accept it and long for it essentially, but also for some social bullies who are criminals and traffickers and who enjoy inflicting that suffering on anyone at hand. And you add a love affair between two of these young people and the pipcture is nearly complete. The last element is the liaison between the young man and the woman-victim of the violence and it introduces us to the impulse that pushes aside the refusal to be violent in sex and that engulfs the young man into being violent against his own rational will. This is the best element in the film : violence comes from a deeply-rooted impulse and cannot be evaded in some situations produced by society.<br/><br/>The last touch of David Lynch's art is the slow motion of the film. And there you are with a cataclysmic denouement that brings both liberation and the pains of growth and the pains of the recollection after growing of these first pains. The butterfly remembers the chrysalid that remembers the larva that maybe ven remembers the egg. No escape from this truth : the child is the father of the man. The minutiae of the work of David Lynch, in this film or others, is a real pleasure in the moonshining process of distilling human emotions. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX. Roger Ebert is one of the greatest movie critics we have today (far superior to Leonard Maltin in every regard). Having said that I would like to disagree with his review of David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet'(a film which evokes some of Ebert's favorite film noirs as well as a sort of detached German expressionest feel - familiar to those who have seen the films of film-makers like Herzog. One thing I really like is the deliberate symbolic nature of the movie (it almost is a parady of itself at times - the darkness underneath all things - the ants that are crawling beneath the soil. I also like Lynch's choice of actors the naive Laura Dern and Kyle Michlouglin and how they are drawn to the dark sides of things - which encompass both the likes of the Isabella Rosellini character (who also is kind of innocent in a twisted way) and Frank (Dennis Hopper) the very depiction of evil. Though I can identify with Ebert just not liking the film (I detest everything Tarantino has done) - I personally find this film to be very meaningful - and in a way funny. <br/><br/>Lynch is possibly the only American film maker (right now) that I truly admire - he completely opens himself up in his films - truly uncompromising. That's "Blue Velvet" she's singing, and that's blue velvet he's got in his mouth. Dennis Hopper combines pure evil with moral degeneracy in a style not to be forgotten in this original shocker from David Lynch. The juxtaposition of the sleepy logging town with the depraved Hopper and his sick crew really makes the evil stand out. Laura Dern, playing a fifties-style sweetheart, is likewise an apt foil for the compromised and befouled Isabella Rossellini (Ingrid Bergman's daughter, lest we forget) who plays a small town chanteuse with some very kinky sexual needs. Kyle MacLachlan stars as a Nancy Drew wanna-be who gets in a couple of fathoms over his head.<br/><br/>The plot is as clever as the devil, surprising us at several turns, yet at no time does it go beyond anything reasonable. The characters are vivid, memorable and entirely believable. This is very close to a great movie. To nit-pick I'd have to say that the feel good resolution could have used a touch of Tabasco, and I was a little annoyed at being lead to believe that the father was a bad cop; in fact I have the feeling that Lynch had another ending in mind but gave us the old style Hollywood finale as a second thought.<br/><br/>Rossellini and her apartment-a simple, but exquisitely designed set-will probably stay with me through the next millennium. Also indelible is Hopper sucking on oxygen or nitrous to turbo himself up to do dirty deeds. The bit from Dean Stockwell as the clown-faced gay, lip syncing a Roy Orbison tune as we wait to see what he and Hopper are going to do to MacLachlan, made my skin crawl. As a longtime fan of Lynch's work (notably Twin Peaks), I can easily say this is not only my favorite, but probably Lynch's best and most important. It is an American classic not in the usual sense of the word. It takes the clichéd stereotypical setting of small town America and does what other similar films have repeatedly failed to do: iluminate the darkness there that lies within not behind those town's drawn curtains, but also within all of us, our motives laid bare.<br/><br/>This is a dark, upsetting, graphic and disturbing film. The plot is deceptively, simple however. Amidst patrotic images of waving firemen and cheery local lumberjacks, as well as colorful hardware store employees, college student Jeffrey Beaumont returns from college to his hometown of Lumberton, North Carolina (which is every bit as weird in real life as it is portrayed on film, haha, I grew up not too far away) when his father falls ill of stroke. There he discovers a severed human ear in a vacant lot, and with the help of lovely Laura Dern (in an amusingly fifties-type style of dress), tracks that ear to the gloomy Lincoln Street apartment of soul singer Dorothy Vallens. Vallens is being repeatedly sexually abused by her husband and young child's ransomer, Frank Booth, a nitrus oxide addict with a penchant for sudden and unpredictable violence.<br/><br/>I won't explain the plot further beyond this point, instead I'll leave the films various subplots and subtexts for your approval. The performances themselves in this film are what make the movie. I do not agree with the other reviewer referring to Kyle Maclachlan as wooden. I find him to be a fine actor, perfectly suited to the naive Jeffrey Beaumont, whose innocence in shattered within the frame of this fine film. Laura Dern is pleasantly supportive as Jeffrey's love interest. But it is Rosselinni and Hopper who shine here. The former gives a perfect portrait of how deeply the effects of repeated sexual violence have affected her mental state. Hopper is in his finest, most troubling performance here, truly made for the role of frightening criminal Frank Booth, a nightmare creature made more horrifying by the fact that there are surely numerous men and women out there just like him. Also notable, Dean Stockwell plays a fine supportive role here as the lounge-crooning Ben, friend of our movie's villain.<br/><br/>The sex is not graphic in this film; however the violence towards the end of the movie is both realistic and unsettling. I can deal with much film gore but there is something about the last 20 minutes or so of this film that haunts me morally. Perhaps Lynch's surreal directing made it all the more disorienting. In any event, this is a fine film, very important to the history of modern American cinema, and deserving of Oscars it never won. Five stars all the way, highly recommended. Director David Lynch may never reach the brilliance he achieved with the ultra weird, kinky sexual awakening surrealist masterpiece 'Blue Velvet'. Released nearly 26 years ago, Blue Velvet has retained every bit of its spellbinding, horrifying power that capitulated it to fame back in 1986. The film possesses a remarkable dream-like quality, similar to those nightmares in which we live out an adventure we wouldn't dare in reality, as we are plunged into a deep REM sleep. Jeffrey Beaumont is at the center of this nightmare, after discovering a human ear, which is considerably out of place in his post-code perfection hometown haven of Lumberton. There is the perfect balance of horror and comedy, and Dennis Hopper is unforgettable in his most talked about role (along with Speed).<br/><br/>Blue Velvet has been called "a tear-stained fabric swatch" for obvious reasons, it has gone down as one of the greatest films of all time for justified reasons, the film is unlike any other. Unmissable.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. It's odd how I got around to David Lynch. I'd just started hanging out with the guy who is now my best friend and he borrowed me a VHS (remember them things?) copy of Wild at Heart. Well, the head bashing was nice, but I couldn't make it through more than 30 minutes. After that it kind of faded, I didn't even know the director at the time. <br/><br/>Fast forward to the release of Mulholland Dr. My interest peaks, and is more than saturated with an overabundance of intense metaphorical symbols and brilliant casting. So, I rent Blue Velvet and, my god, I got what I got from M.D. times 100. Blue Velvet is, more or less, like watching a nightmare, like if Bunuel had raped Hitchcock after he had raped Herzog, or something along those lines. <br/><br/>This is what a gripping movie should be; intelligent, well written, and when it's over you think to yourself, "wait, it's over already, DAMNIT, GIMME MORE!" (apparently it was originally around 4 hours long, but all the missing stuff has long since disappeared.) The story is simple, and noirish, in the fact that it's a simple young man entering a world he had no clue existed, being shoved into the absurd, vile and deranged world of one particular fellow by the name of Frank, and his victims. <br/><br/>I've seen Blue Velvet, I think, 7 times now, and I plan to view it many more times in the future. It remains one of the strongest, greatest films of the 1980s, along with "Raging Bull". Despite its notoriety as a weird or kinky film, "Blue Velvet" should be both structurally and thematically clear to anyone who has read a narrative such as Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" and who has at least a moderate interest in Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self. It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably "Rear Window" and "Psycho." The most important lines occur early in the film when the protagonist, Kyle MacLachlan, tells Laura Dern that he needs to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Isabella Rosselli because "knowledge requires risk" but with the possible reward that "you might learn something." By the end of the narrative, MacLachlan's character should have learned a lot, but here's where Lynch flinches, much like Robert Altman in the conclusion to "The Player." MacLachlan emerges neither a sadder nor wiser man from his rite of passage and his descent into the dark corners of the psyche. Instead, Lynch commits the ultimate cynical sin, reprising the film's innocent opening and throwing in the viewer's face the hopelessly artificial, Pollyanna-ish, pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer.<br/><br/>This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the film, though some of the following may help the viewer make sense of the narrative. Jeff confronts first mortality (his father stricken by a life-threatening stroke), then a severed, decaying human ear. The ear, the organ of hearing, is also the sense that fully awakens only in the dark, granting access to the Dionysian, the deep intuitive wellsprings of the self. But the ear we see on screen has become a diseased, useless instrument in a "sunny" culture whose idea of music is Bobby Vinton's version of "Blue Velvet." Rossellini's alternative version of the song, with all of its sensuous, alluring darkness, will draw MacLachlan in to the same degree that it repells girl friend Dern (contrast this relationship with that of Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in "Rear Window," where Kelly becomes increasingly drawn to the voyeuristic and "ghoulish" activity initiated by Stewart). Soon MacLaclan will discover the love substitutes embodied by both Rossellini and Hopper--the sadism and masochism, fetishism and scopophilia that, like it or not, are present in every son and daughter who has inherited from birth and learned from upbringing the pleasure/pain principle that underlies even the most well-intentioned, "selfless" love (the absence of any shown feelings between MacLaclan and either parent is another tip-off to the basis of his attraction to the dominitrix/sex slave character played by Rossellini).<br/><br/>Certainly Lynch must know, along with every other artist who has dealt with the theme, the risk along with the necessity of making touch with these feelings in order to achieve a fuller, richer, more knowing life in the time one has left. MacLaclan tells the naive and shielded Dern from the beginning that it's extremely dangerous business (think of Mann's "Death in Venice"). But the alternative is a Salem where everybody is "good," a Lumberton where people get sick but never die, a Disney fantasy that can exist only in artificial movies. Lynch may have thought he was being ironically clever by giving his viewers the "escape" they probably crave. I'd say "cowardly" is more like it. This film (in fact, most any other film since 1980) is easily eclipsed by his own "Elephant Man," where both the screenplay and the circumstances of the historical John Merrick insured the right ending. Unfortunately, someone let him write his own script for "Blue Velvet." David Lynch's style and his films are always amazing. His films are yet to be matched, he really is the Stanley Kubrick of today, and I say that with great confidence, and every single bit of respect to Mister Kubrick, who is also one of my favourite directors. Blue Velvet is one of my favorite films of all time. It encompasses everything that I love about films. It moves you, and it doesn't have to move you in a good way, but it challenges you to think. It has a great feel, it's so glossy and perfectly twisted. The film evokes a nostalgic throwback to the peaceful and safe 1950s, yet at the same time it is like you are stepping into a portal transporting you back to the 80s. I love everything from the characters to the attack on a seemingly idealistic, trustworthy American suburbia. Controversial because it challenged normal behavior, got inside sexuality and depravity and made you feel completely uncomfortable at times, even to the point where you could dry reach. The stylization is like no other. Like I said before, the film evokes an indescribable feeling, it is stylistically and visually compelling. The saturated colour's pop at you like a candy bar.<br/><br/>I have never seen anything that lives up to this electrifying masterpiece, not even Lynch's own, although "Mulholland Drive" (2001) is one of my favourite films, it will never escape "Blue Velvet's" shadow, because this film really is a classic, all the inferior imitators are just swimming in its wake, and will continue to do so, because the potency of Blue Velvet cannot be matched. The operative word on "Blue Velvet" is surreal. I'm not going to try to analyze it but I'm just going to say I like it. When this film was released in 1986 it came way out from leftfield. It was a totally unexpected surprise from the director of "Elephant Man" and the collossal bomb, "Dune"(maybe it shouldn't have been so unexpected for anybody who had seen the equally bizarre "Eraserhead"). David Lynch opens the film as some Norman Rockwell American world and slowly peels off the layers of this facade to reveal the dark underbelly of this idyll. The movie begins where fresh-faced Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) returns home from college following his father's heart attack. He discover's a dismembered ear in a field and turns it over to the police.<br/><br/>Jeffrey is not contented with leaving the investigation to the police, so he goes on his own investigation to discover the mystery of the ear. What he encounters is a mysterious lounge singer, Dorothy Valens(Isabella Rossellini) and Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper)a bizarre fetishist who has Dorothy under his control. Hopper's rendering of Frank ranks as one of the great examples of screen villainy of all time. Hopper's performance is indelible and over-the-top. In a smaller role Dean Stockwell as Frank's sexually ambiguous friend, Ben, makes an impression with his lip-synced performance of Roy Orbison's song, "In Dreams". This film definitely falls under the category of love-it or hate-it. I fall under the former category because I admire Lynch for trying something so ambitious and being a singular voice in film-making. Despite its notoriety as a graphic, weird, overtly sexual or kinky film, "Blue Velvet" should be both structurally and thematically clear to anyone who has read a narrative such as Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" and who has at least a moderate interest in Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self. It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably "Rear Window" and "Psycho."

Lynch may have thought he was being ironically clever by giving his viewers the "escape" they probably crave. I'd say "cowardly" is more like it. This film (in fact, most any other film since 1980) is easily eclipsed by his own "Elephant Man," where both the screenplay and the circumstances of the historical John Merrick insured the right ending. Unfortunately, someone let him write his own script for "Blue Velvet." This is a brilliant film, and has become one of my favourites. It is an unforettable experience. It's really just another week in the South, folks. We all carry on like this down here. I can send you all the Franks and Bens and Dorothys you would ever want to meet direct from North Carolina (where Lynch filmed this classic). This fact used to really amuse me in LA where I saw this back in 1986, and everyone then and there thought Lynch had invented some sci-fi world. Oh, Lynch had definitely taken sharp, genius note of smalltown America in the South: that is what makes an artist good. <br/><br/>But 'Blue Velvet' is REAL, folks, just in case you've been stuck in Visalia or San Diego all of your life with all of those colorless people pretending so hard to look and feel like a Gap ad.<br/><br/>None of this should be taken to mean that BLUE VELVET is anything less than a wonderful black comedy packed with brilliant moments of poetry, cinematic fireworks, and slippery kitsch. There are few moments in comedy/surrealism to equal Dean Stockwell lipsynching to Orbison's "In Dreams", or Dennis Hopper repeating the same lyrics to Kyle McLachlan before he smears the kid with lipstick and sneers "Pretty! Pretty! Pretty!"<br/><br/>Lynch's tale is also a rather acute evisceration of a psychosexual journey in the mind of a young man, Jeffrey Beaumont (Beaumont means of course, "beautiful mountain", or "beautiful view" even). He meets Dorothy Valens (self-explanatory), and is visited by his blond siren, gal pal Sandy (the Goddess Cassandra, of course.) BLUE VELVET is ripe with readings and references.<br/><br/>Lynch's is a wonderful achievement in having a good, wild time at the movies. Wasn't this one of the few films of the 80s or 90s that even managed to pull one completely into its dream? For me it was. Most junk today is just passive eyecandy, face it.<br/><br/>'Ben, you are so suaaaaave.' <br/><br/>'Frank, stop it!! I like to sing Blue Velvet! Mommy Loves You!' In many respects - well, almost every respect - this is a brilliant film. The contrast between the violence and seaminess of Frank's world and the laughable banality of Jeffery's world comes across perfectly. Dennis Hopper's performance as Frank really cannot be praised enough. Sure, he's impressive when he's huffing nitrous oxide and hitting Jeffrey across the face, but his expression while listening to the old lounge songs - melancholy, regretful - is equally convincing, and he's almost sympathetic.<br/><br/>Also classic is the moment when another character proposes to toast his health, and he mutters: 'Aw, let's drink to something else.' Jeffrey's Reeve-like blankness is a good foil for him. That said, there's just something - something about the random imagery inserted, like subliminal shots but held for longer, images of a snuffed candle and insects - something about the pacing, the long silences and occasional anticlimax - and something about the surprising semi-happy ending - that doesn't work. I feel like I'm missing something, and maybe I just am, but I don't feel like Lynch accomplished everything he set out to do. Just when it could be frightening, it lapses into comedy. This vagueness may be part of the message - life isn't black-and-white, or clean - but still. The movie is effective, but it doesn't resonate. Still, it is an unmissable film for anyone who wants to see a film that changed cinema itself. When David Lynch's masterpiece "Blue Velvet" first came out, many recognized the powerful, surreal vision of the avant garde director, yet dismissed the film as an attack on the notion of a "nuclear family." However, nothing could be further from the truth. Unlike "American Beauty," "Blue Velvet" does not cloak the depravity of its characters in the context of the average suburbian experience: Instead it localizes it and embodies it in sado-masochistic Frank (played by the manic Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>Here, Lynch gives us one of the most complex Oedipal fantasies to be captured on film, but in the end the family unit is restored and its sanctity saved...or is it? Still, the film is about mood and texture, and Lynch's vivid surrealist imagery lends itself well to the mystery genre. Not for the squeamish, this film depicts violent sexuality which remains as controversial today as it did back then--so buyer beware. Nevertheless, the film itself is now a timeless classic, and far better than "American Beauty". David Lynch crafted one of the most visually haunting films ever imagined in 1986 with Blue Velvet. Dream like from the beginning, the film starts off simply enough, we see the residents of a small town enjoying themselves, in fact the town is what anyone and everyone would envision as a perfect town community. Young college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan, who was also in Lynch's Dune and would later star on Lynch's TV show Twin Peaks) returns to his seemingly perfect town when his father suffers a heart attack (in a very chilling scene). One day he discovers a severed human ear that is decomposing in a field, and this is when we as the viewers discover that this seemingly perfect little town is hiding some deadly secrets. Eventually, Jeffrey teams up with a young Laura Dern (who it seems is modeled after a 1950's high school sweet heart) and both begin playing detective, and it soon leads them to a tortured nightclub singer named Dorothy(played by Isabella Rossellini), who has some secrets of her own. This leads Jeffrey to begin to have a dangerous obsession with Dorothy, and that is not taken too well by Frank (Dennis Hopper, who is extremely great in this completely psycho role), a man who is terrorizing Dorothy for his own sexual perversions, and is holding her child hostage to attain them. Later on we get to see Frank and his crazed crew (Brad Dourif among them), and we meet his "oh so suave" buddy Ben (Dean Stockwell), who has only one screen appearance, but it is a chilling one nonetheless.<br/><br/>The only complaint I can think of is how the film ended, it seems to me that Lynch had an alternate ending but decided to go with the one featured here. Lynch pulls out all the stops here, tugging at every emotion he can. You'll laugh, cringe, feel sorry for the characters, and be horrified, sometimes all at once. Blue Velvet is a haunting, dizzying, mind bending trip that will haunt you for days after viewing it, this is Lynch's best film, and it stands today as an American classic. The existence of Blue Velvet and all it stands for confirms that it really is a strange world. Set in the quiet picture postcard logging community of Lumbertown, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), a somewhat naive and squeaky clean college boy, finds a severed human ear. Shocked and disturbed he reports it immediately to the police whilst, with the help of his girlfriend (Laura Dern), he begins his own investigation, which soon leads him into stumbling into the seedy and violent world of abused nightclub singer Dorothy (Isabella Rosellini) and drug-sniffing psychopath (Dennis Hopper). This is the first movie in which David Lynch really showed us all his cards and united themes and imagery, now familiar to millions through the likes of Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart and Twin Peaks. Although 16 years old, David Lynch's Blue Velvet has lost none of its shock value. It is still deeply and uniquely disturbing, at times incredibly surreal and utterly compelling viewing. Beautifully filmed and directed by Lynch, its aesthetic value is often deliberately at odds with the subject matter and it is a work of dark genius. It also features superb acting performances all round. In particular, MacLachlan, Rosselinni, Dean Stockwell and Laura Dern shine, but it is Dennis Hopper's magnificent performance as a drug sniffing twisted psychopath that most people will remember.<br/><br/>Bizarre and frequently haunting, beautiful but frequently surreal, this is a movie that will stay with you for a very long time and really is a must see! David Lynch (Twin Peaks) is a true visionary. You'll often hear, "He's not for everyone." Which is probably true. His films aren't for the summer blockbuster movie-goer. Regularly, his films are far more than meets the eye. Normally, there are dark secrets accompanied by dark, sometimes uncomfortable, humor. His style caters to that select following who long for movies with meaning beneath the surface. Symbolism and metaphor run rampant in everything David directs, writes or paints. Here, he uses a severed ear to represent a tunnel into a strange world.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper's description of Lynch's paintings as 'American surrealism' can also be applied to "Blue Velvet", and most of David Lynch's movies. His world is surreal indeed. And to make sure we as normal human beings understand this, Lynch's characters repeat the line, "It's a strange world", throughout the film. So take that into consideration when watching anything 'Lynch-y'.<br/><br/>The movie was a small budget production and it looked it. Lynch received a ten million dollar budget and a handshake for creative control of the movie - which included the final-cut. He obviously used it all. You'll get a 1980s movie feel when you watch "Blue Velvet" but its not in a not-so-80s type town. From the clothes and the trendy earring that Kyle MacLachlan wears to the big flowing hair, make-up and apartment decor, this movie is totally 80s.<br/><br/>Lynch's original script was based on bits and pieces of ideas and concepts for a movie and went through several years of writing and multiple drafts. Finally, he fit the pieces together and in the end had a four-hour cut of the movie. Working with Duwayne Dunham (film editor) they were able to cut it down and deliver the film just one scene over the requested two-hour movie. Needless to say, several scenes were left on the cutting-room floor, never to be seen again, and only reproduced through still photos in a deleted scene montage found on the DVD.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is about a college student, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who comes across a severed ear while walking through a field. He delivers the ear to the police and is told not to ask any further questions about the case. His curiosity leads him into his own investigation after he gets information from the Police Chief's daughter, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern). Jeffrey breaks into a suspect's apartment, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), and he ends up hidden in her closet where he witnesses her in a sado-masochistic sexual act controlled by a 'dangerous man', Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Clues and information is gathered and Jeffery finds himself in the middle of a deep dark mystery that only he can solve.<br/><br/>This was MacLachlan's second film with David Lynch, the first being "Dune". Lynch knew he wanted MacLachlan for his innocent and curious 'look'. Later MacLachlan would star in Lynch's successful TV series "Twin Peaks". Without even a read, Lynch signed Dern to play the part of MacLachlan's love interest. Isabella Rossellini was not Lynch's first choice but he was convinced she could play the part of Dorothy Vallens after meeting Rosselini at a restaurant in New York. Rosselini was previously in "White Nights" and essentially realized a career in acting after starring in "Blue Velvet" – her second American film.<br/><br/>Most performances were sub-par to Rosselini's excellent portrayal of a victimized woman. Ebert found the performance by Rosselini to be convincing and courageous in a film that didn't deserve her performance. Ebert states, "She is degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film". Gene Siskel, on the other hand, gave "Blue Velvet" a thumbs up (1986). A lot of people talk about Blue Velvet like it's a masterpiece and that it is something particularly special, linking the amount of meaning in the film to the deep symbolic meaning of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but Blue Velvet is nowhere near as poetic and meaningful. It is merely a decent thriller with a strong sexual overtone nothing different to the average Hollywood sex thriller: Basic Instinct (1992), Body Heat, Body Double, Fatal Attraction, Blue Velvet is in the same league with some added try hard Surrealism.<br/><br/>David Lynch is no Dali as some people seem to think, and nor is this film anything like Dali's work. I hated most of his films, Mulholland Drive (2001) exists purely to tease and confuse the viewer, Lost Highway (1997) exits for similar reasons, to throw the viewer off. The only work of Lynch's I admire, and consider real surrealism, is Eraserhead (1977), now that is a film in Dali's league. Blue Velvet, however, is a simple detective thriller with an over-hyped performance by Dennis Hopper. David Lynch crafted one of the most haunting films ever imagined in 1986 with Blue Velvet. Dreamlike and beautifully surreal from the beginning, the film starts off simply enough, we see the residents of a small town enjoying themselves, in fact the town is what anyone and everyone would envision as a perfect town community. This is David Lynch's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Young college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan, who was also in Lynch's Dune and would later star on Lynch's TV show Twin Peaks) returns to his seemingly perfect town when his father suffers a heart attack (in a very chilling scene). One day he discovers a severed human ear that is decomposing in a field, and this is when we as the viewers discover that this seemingly perfect little town is hiding some deadly secrets.

Lynch pulls out all the stops here, tugging at every emotion he can. You'll laugh, cringe, feel sorry for the characters, and be horrified, sometimes all at once. Blue Velvet is a haunting, dizzying, mind bending trip that will haunt you for days after viewing it, this is Lynch's best film, and it stands today as an American classic. In the opening of "Blue Velvet", the third film of cult favorite director David Lynch, we see a charming all-American town. Everything is characterized by happiness, innocence and the American way. Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) is on the way home from a hospital visit, where he saw his father who has recently suffered a stroke. While walking, he crosses a grass field, where he comes across a milky, rotting human ear crawling with bugs. It's a foreign object for this small town Americana idyll. Jeffrey, clearly horrified, takes the ear to his town sheriff. This is probably the type of American town where everybody knows everybody, you can go to your neighbor to borrow milk, have a good old conversation across the fence and everybody's business is everybody's business. Nothing here, is out of the ordinary, until we see the ear. And that's what makes "Blue Velvet" so remarkable. This ear is, unbeknown to Jeffrey, his entry into another world that co-exists in his humble hometown. A blonde, "girl-next-door" type, known as Sandy (Laura Dern), becomes his accomplice and partner. They become two young detectives gradually drawing themselves deeper into the sadistic madness that secretly inhabits their town, home to Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini in a wig), a tortured and fragile lounge singer whose sanity is probably hanging by a thread. This is quite clearly arousing to Jeffrey, sneaking into this lounge singer's apartment, in hope of finding a clue.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a film about seeing what has always been hidden, Jeffrey even mentions this in the film: "I'm seeing something that has always been hidden", he says to Sandy. What he is seeing is the perversity that characterizes his town, and in a way, the perversion that characterizes childhood. Jeffrey observes more than he bargained for in Dorothy's apartment. When she returns unexpectedly, rips the closet door open and orders him to come out and "strip", the boundless terror in his eyes exposes him as a peeping tom caught in the act, although he is obviously aroused by the act despite being held at knife-point. He experiences pleasure and power. David Lynch toys with these phenomena and makes the viewer an accomplice to the bizarre happenings. The scene in which Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth (an icon) rapes Dorothy is just as shocking, sickening and disturbing as the shower murder in Hitchock's "Psycho", a film I would compare to "Blue Velvet", because both films are as important for the cinematic era they were made in (1980s for this, 1960s for "Psycho").<br/><br/>All of it is too shocking for Jeffrey to comprehend, and it all seems so very out-of-the-ordinary for the every-town like his. But it wasn't, Jeffrey was an observer and participant and Frank became the representation of Jeffrey's repressed desires. The "bad" side of Jeffrey is Frank Booth. Frank's conscious acts are Jeffrey's unconscious desires. Toward the end of the film, when good finally overcomes evil, the camera shows a close up of an ear, but this time it's Jeffrey's and it's intact with the body it comes from. The fissures in this perfect little town are apparently sealed, and Jeffrey's journeys into the perverse, dark side of his soul are over. But is this permanent or just a temporary respite...? The genius in this film is that there could always be something lurking, something hidden behind the perfectly trimmed, green grass displayed by the swarming beetles in th grass in "Blue Velvet's" incredible opening scene.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an amazing film. It is an exhilarating experience and although you have been sitting in your chair for the 120 minute running time, you feel as if you've been running for about 3 hours, the experience is so exhausting. While the film is dark, horrifying and sadistic, it is also beautiful and dreamlike. It is a surreal journey into the loss of innocence and the dark, unknown depths of the human soul. There is a Jeffrey in all of us - a desire to journey into the unknown and the human nature of sexual desire that is stripped bare in Blue Velvet. Highly recommended. Never have I seen a film that has impacted on me so greatly. I had to re-watch it to fully grasp it, the intensity of this film is spellbinding. It is a thriller, but not a typical thriller, it contain elements of surrealism, very off-key and bizarre moments. It certainly does not deserve the label as a cheap "erotic sex romp" type of thriller, akin to "Basic Instinct" (1992), because it certainly is not. What it is -- however -- is a deeply effective study on human nature, desire, obsession, surfaces and voyeurism. It's a film about surfaces and what lies beneath. This is an incredible film, totally unique, completely compelling and refreshing and intelligent, not the spoon-fed dribble you get from Hollywood. This is a completely original film one that has become the standard by which all others are measured. Dennis Hopper is unforgettable, probably his greatest and most memorable performance here. The visuals and cinematography are beautiful. Even when the most gruesome and horrifying things are depicted (the splatter of head matter, bugs crawling) everything remains breathtaking - Blue Velvet is filmed beautifully.<br/><br/>The only deviation is the acting on Laura Dern's behalf. She has developed into quite a decent actress, although her acting is particularly poor in this film, it is somewhat distracting. But otherwise, this is an unmissable film and definitely worth starting with if you want to indulge into the world of David Lynch - because it gets much weirder from here (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). Blue Velvet is easily the best film of the 1980s, and quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time. Anyone that hasn't seen it, is truly missing out on such a unique, polarizing and unforgettable experience. I just recently saw David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" on the big screen (and in widescreen) for the first time. Having seen it now in its original aspect ratio, I can't bear to go back to my pan-and-scan videotape. Thank goodness that it's coming out on DVD. "Blue Velvet," quite simply, is the best film of the 1980's; the only film that comes close to it is Scorsese's "Raging Bull." "Blue Velvet" was so ahead of its time when it was first released back in 1986. In fact, it remains so today, judging by the bewildered faces of people who were at the revival showing I attended. The film precedes "American Beauty" in blowing the doors off of the closet that Suburbia keeps its skeletons in, telling the story of a young college kid who, after finding a severed human ear, gets caught up in murder and mayhem in his hometown of "Lumberton USA." Lynch goes to great lengths to set up his picture-book depiction of small-town American life (complete with bright red fire trucks, white picket fences, and blue skies) before taking a wrecking ball to it. Like he did in his debut, "Eraserhead," Lynch shows us what we look like (tedium and all) but purposely twists our view of it, like a mad optometrist giving us the wrong eyeglass prescription. Apart from the fine directing, "Blue Velvet" boasts an excellent cast that delivers each line with patented Lynch-quirkiness. Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey Beaumont like a modern-day Dante, travelling through the Inferno he never knew his hometown was. Isabella Rosselini is spectacularly disturbing as Dorothy Vallens, a lounge singer whose husband and son have been abducted. Her character is a first: a femme fatale who is more dangerous to herself than anyone else. And in what may be one of the top ten tour-de-force performances of all time, Dennis Hopper, as oxygen-huffing crime boss/hedonist Frank Booth, makes you laugh one minute, and cringe with fear the next after realizing that such a person probably does exist. You may not agree that "Blue Velvet" is the best film of the 80's but you'll have to do some digging to find one more original. It is a contemporary film noir classic that deserves to withstand the test of time like older noir classics such as "Double Indemnity" and "The Big Sleep." So far, it appears to be holding up. It's a strange world and "Blue Velvet" (both the film itself and the fact that it was made) is solid proof of just how strange it can be. Blue Velvet is quite an achievement. It is David Lynch's dark thriller. But Blue Velvet is such a unique film that a genre hardly even applies to it. There is no other movie like it. Its uniqueness can be credited to the fact that David Lynch followed few, if any, rules when he made this movie. He wasn't trying to make a blockbuster, nor was he trying to please the audience. David Lynch does not conform to the typical Hollywood format. <br/><br/>This is why his movies, Blue Velvet in particular, are so original, so creative. I think it is easily David Lynch's best movie, and he's got some good movies. This one stands out from the rest, though. It's just as provocative as the others, but it maintains a balance, a balance that his other films don't always have. For example, Eraserhead, although a very good film, is much harder to follow than Blue Velvet and lacks the accessibility and strong narrative structure that Blue Velvet has. Blue Velvet is defined a dark thriller, but it is so much more. <br/><br/>It has elements of mystery, romance, drama, suspense, and comedy. There is incredible tension in the film between the four main characters. All four of these characters are very interesting, and they develop a lot throughout the movie. Blue Velvet is basically a strange tale of good versus evil, but its surreal atmosphere, its rich symbolism, and the thrilling, often amusing chemistry between its characters layer the film, giving it nuance and cinematic ingenuity.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet takes place in a small North Carolina town called Lumberton. This town is seemingly very peaceful, very relaxed. These characteristics are present in the beginning of the movie. We see shots of beautiful flowers growing tall next to a clean white fence. We see an older man happily watering his yard. We see a fire truck with a fireman standing on the edge of it, waving, smiling as if he doesn't have a care in the world. All of these scenes develop the calm, peaceful atmosphere of Lumberton. All of these scenes are also misleading. We soon get to know the characters of Jeffrey Beaumont, and Sandy Williams. <br/><br/>Sandy and Jeffrey represent the peaceful, calm aspects of the town. Jeffrey happens to find a human ear in a field one day. He takes it to the police but they don't do much of anything. But soon he begins his own investigation of the severed ear, and this leads him to another character, Dorothy Vallens, who leads him to Frank Booth, a sadistic and deranged man, played by Dennis Hopper whose performance as a raving lunatic is extremely unsettling. Dorothy and Frank represent the unstable, reckless, and volatile underworld of crime in the town. The dramatic contrast between peace and chaos in this movie is brilliant.<br/><br/>Soon into the movie, an odd conflict between the protagonist and antagonist ensues; all the while, the movie becomes more and more compelling. Of course, you may yourself under the dreamy spell of Blue Velvet from the beginning, but the entertainment only increases throughout. Blue Velvet becomes so engrossing, so strange, so surreal, yet so believable that the viewer wants to finish the movie even if they are taken aback by it, even offended. Blue Velvet is a movie about a quiet, happy, small town with a sinister underworld lying beneath the very noses of its inhabitants. <br/><br/>Some of us know a small town like Lumberton; some live in a small town like Lumberton. Some of us can imagine such shady, degraded characters living in our own town. But, at the same time, the movie is so strange that you might find yourself suddenly surprised by the weird things that go on in it. It's so random that, at one moment, you may be following it, but, at the next moment, you may not know what you're watching anymore. All the same, Blue Velvet is a classic. It is definitely one of the greatest movie of the 80's. It is a captivating movie, a triumph, a stunning achievement. In my opinion, it is one of the most creative movies of all time. This is one of my favorite David Lynch films and I honestly believe it is still his best work. It is also one of the more transparent of Lynch's films, although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites, but this makes Blue Velvet probably the best candidate for introducing someone to Lynch's work, without letting it get over their heads.<br/><br/>While Blue Velvet is far more transparent and linear on a surface level, I don't think I will ever figure out the multi-layered, bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the films surface--even though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. However, there are clearly many layers to Blue Velvet, after all, the film is about "what lies beneath" or what is usually hidden to the naked eye. The plot concerns a young, fresh-faced man who is brought into his towns seedy, drug and sex infested underworld after he proceeds with the investigation of the discover of a human ear. This ear draws him into a world where he must face his hidden impulses and darkest desires, and chose between them or leading a normal, sanitary lifestyle. He is introduced to one of the most crazed psycho villains to grace the screen - Frank Booth, which some see as the darker side of Jeffrey - his true wants and desires are manifested in Frank.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet caused quite a stir when it was released, because it was one of the most original films in American cinema history. And it still is, it manages to hold up perfectly well after all these years. Age has certainly not weathered this dark masterpiece.<br/><br/>*WARNING: CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED OR PRUDISH PERSON* The 80's was an era full of classic teen flicks, National Lampoons films, and futuristic thrillers. However, one of the biggest standouts of the decade was a bizarre, sexually charged but beautiful gem that defies any kind of genre.<br/><br/>It is David Lynch's greatest masterpiece, 'Blue Velvet'. The film starts out by taking the viewer on a journey to a classic part of Americana: the squeaky-clean, rose-bush filled, smiling small town that's almost too perfect. We're invited to temporarily join this sleepy city, where everything seems to be peaches and cream and as American as apple pie. At least, so it seems.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey Beaumont, a college student coming back home to visit his family and preparing for a dull, long summer when he makes a gruesome discovery. He could just forget about it and spend the long summer days wooing local girl Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), but he instead begins a bizarre journey that tears the glossy cover off of his small town, exposing a dark and twisted underbelly that he can't help but delve into.<br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini is mesmerizing as Dorothy, a cabaret singer whose demented admirer, Dennis Hopper in a role that was made for him, dominates her by holding something terrifying over her head. Jeffrey soon finds himself involved with Dorothy's life, and the viewer is entreated to one of the most erotic sex scenes in cinema, involving voyeurism and a bout of violent lovemaking that makes the viewer question how Isabella Rossellini's character really feels about the position she's in.<br/><br/>Sandy and Kyle's blossoming love story would be just like that of any other small town couple, if it weren't for the bizarre mystery they find themselves a part of. In dark contrast to this almost-sweet love story are the appearances of very frightening psychotic characters, Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth and Dean Stockwell's Ben. They are some of the weirdest, most sinister characters in cinema, and Lych's use of classic songs like 'Blue Velvet' and Roy Orbison's 'In Dreams' makes climactic sequences in the film even more surreal and scary.<br/><br/>This film clearly didn't sit too well with some viewers, but it was great that David Lynch tried to force something so twisted on mainstream audiences. All of the actors and actresses in the film give great performances, although Isabella Rossellini had to experience some of the same difficulties Maria Schneider did in 'Last Tango in Paris' with her sex scenes. But the result of filling a film with so many emotions, including those that we may not like to see surface, is an amazing cinematic masterpiece. It is emotionally exhausting, but brilliant.<br/><br/>So for holding up a mirror to America that reflects stark, mad buried truth instead of what we want to see, 'Blue Velvet' truly deserves every positive reflection and credit it can get, it's an amazing, unmissable film, and one of the few true American 'classics'. this film caught my attention last year when i studied it in a film course, and a lot of people had devoted, warmed opinions of the film, so i became eager to check it out. somehow, it erased itself from my memory until i caught it in the DVD store a few weeks back, at such a low price, i decided to pick it up and try it out. by the end, i was absolutely mesmerized. it was a haunting experience, i was completely exhausted by the end. but a good feeling of exhaustion. it's certainly a very wrenching film, not something i can see people being saddened by, but is certainly very emotionally compelling. the performances are amazing. i've seen a lot of criticism on kyle maclachlans part, for his so-called 'wooden' performance - however, this is his character. wooden and cartoon-like. this is how jeffrey beaumont would act if he existed. maclachlan was playing the character perfectly. dennis hopper and isabella rossellini were the real standouts, mr. hopper's terrifying, bizarre performance is an absolute standout.<br/><br/>a film not to be missed! Returning home from college for the holidays, young Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) gets a job in the local hardware store and starts romancing policeman's daughter Sandy (Laura Dern). But when the discovery of a severed ear leads him to start spying on the beautiful singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), he finds himself drawn into a dangerous underworld. As if finding himself torn between his feelings for Sandy and a passionate but dangerous relationship with Dorothy isn't enough, he also falls foul of Dennis Hopper's psychotic Frank Booth, one of cinema's all-time classic villains. And in discovering this dark side to his all-American community, he also discovers an unexpected darkness in himself.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet opens with cinema's most remarkable bizarre gardening accident, cutting away from the roses to show us the dark earth beneath, with all the things which squirm in it. It's packed with iconic imagery - the red-breasted robin (which David Lynch insisted was real for years, though it's not even a good model); Frank puffing away at nitrous oxide through his gas mask; Jeffrey peering out through the bars of the closet door; and of course the eponymous dress itself, worn by Dorothy onstage and later in the squalid moments of her secret life. <br/><br/>It also makes elegant use of music, notably Roy Orbison's In Dreams. Working with a rich colour palette and lush soundscape, Lynch creates a world which is almost hyper-real, a world which draws heavily on Jungian archetypes and which carries a much more powerful weight of meaning than the narrative alone would suggest. <br/><br/>This is very much a modern folk tale, a story of two children who stray from the path and encounter monsters. Lynch's genius is to treat his monsters with sympathy, so that even the brutal Frank comes across less as a moral agent than as a force of nature. On one level it can be seen as a coming of age tale, but in entering adulthood Jeffrey must accept a certain ambiguity about his own moral stance - in a film which is visually very neat, there is no neat moral or emotional resolution.<br/><br/>There's a simplicity about Blue Velvet - almost an innocence - which contrasts markedly with Lynch's later work. As such, it makes a good introductory film through which to get to know his various obsessions. With its powerful narrative, finely tuned performances and an unmatchable style, you will find yourself drawn in as surely as Jeffrey is. This is one of the great masterpieces of modern cinema, a film which you will never forget. Dreamlike and hauntingly poetic, it's emotionally wrenching and an absolutely unmissable film experience. I sat down to watch David Lynch's Blue Velvet, expecting to see a movie that lived up to its iconic status. I had seen bits and pieces of it, particularly the 'rape scene', and I just wanted to see it in its entirety. It started off well, but after about a half an hour I LITERALLY fell asleep, and it was no where near bedtime.<br/><br/>I think my lack of interest was that there was almost no character development. My favorite character was Dorothy and I wanted to know more about her before the story. But she and the rest of the cast just kinda came into scenes when they were needed and then disappeared like a flash in the pan. Other characters barely get their time in. More than once I asked myself, "Ok, what happened to that guy?" The movie just did a bad job of relaying the story. The character Frank, while brilliantly acted, cannot be taken seriously.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it had an interesting visual stylization, fantastic surreal scenes and an excellent story that could have been played off better, but now having seen it in 2009, it looses its shock value that wowed so many people back in 1986, most of whom were very quick to call it a classic.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt letdown by the final product. There really wasn't any acting that was worth noting and Dennis Hopper, and David Lynch's direction was the only thing keeping this ship from completely sinking. I saw Blue Velvet 22 years after it was first released. Since it came out we've had a little thing called the internet develop and expose us to all kinds of perversion and depravity. Despite this, I found Blue Velvet to still be shocking. <br/><br/>A young lad played by Machlachlan finds a human ear in a field. He takes it to the police and in his own investigation enters a dark subculture unseen during the daylight in his small town of Lumberton. <br/><br/>The look of this film is typical Lynch - vivid colors, dramatic camera angles, possessing a "dream-like" quality. The acting is quite good by all the major characters. Obvious standouts are Isabella Rosselini as Dorothy Vallens and Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. Both Rosselini and Hopper disappear into their roles and give powerful and utterly fearless performances. <br/><br/>This is a remarkable piece of film-making. Unlike other Lynch films the plot is very easy to follow. However, it is still shocking and might make you uncomfortable. See it at least once. Most other directors labor long and hard to achieve the fevered, talked-about perversity that comes so naturally to David Lynch, whose ''Blue Velvet'' went from instant cult art-house film to absolute American classic. With Eraserhead (1977), The Elephant Man (1980) and Dune (1983) to his credit, Mr. Lynch had already established his beachhead inside the realm of the bizarre, but this latest venture takes him a lot further, even furtherer than the truly weird Lost Highway (1997) and Inland Empire (2006). Kinkiness is its salient quality, but Blue Velvet has everything, deadpan humor, as well as a straight-arrow side that makes its eccentricity all the crazier. There's no mistaking the exhilarating fact that it's one of a kind film.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet, which has been one of my favourite films since I first studied it for a film class, has a brilliant introductory sequence that sets the tone for the best of what will follow, and goes a long way toward excusing the worst of it. The place is Anywhere, U.S.A., or actually a small, beautiful coastal town called Lumberton, where the local radio station devotes a lot of energy to log-related humor. (It is, among other things, ''the town that knows how much wood a woodchuck chucks,'' and a place where the sound of the falling timber tells you the time.) With Bobby Vinton on the soundtrack, Mr. Lynch presents the blue skies, trim flowerbeds and sweet, creamed-coloured little houses of a suburbia so perfect that it looks surreal and dreamlike. It is surreal and it may be dreamlike, but its surface is hardly impermeable. Mr. Lynch makes that clear almost immediately, by letting the camera dip down through a neat, weedless lawn, past a homeowner who has just had an apparent seizure, to observe the teeming hordes of insects living in the dirt.<br/><br/>Figuratively speaking, the film means to remain at bug's-eye level for nearly two hours, until it is ready to return to the surface for an ironically sunny coda. And if the sheer creepiness of that first descent seems a hard act to follow, Mr. Lynch is more than up to the challenge. Once the film's hero, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), discovers a severed ear lying in the tall grass and begins tracing its origin, ''Blue Velvet'' begins ricocheting from one weird episode to another, propelled by the logic of a bad dream. These forays seem to grow even longer and stranger as the film progresses. ''Blue Velvet'' is overloaded with the kinds of piquant little details that would stand up nicely to the repeat viewings it will undoubtedly receive. When it comes to the larger points that might give its plot some semblance of rationality, though, it is sorely - and maybe even deliberately - lacking.<br/><br/>The ear, in brief, leads to a detective (George Dickerson) and his pretty, inquisitive daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern, who's as demure as Nancy Drew), who tells Jeffrey she ''hears things - bits and pieces'' about the severed article. Together, Sandy and Jeffrey trace matters to a torchy singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) who becomes the sweet, blond Sandy's erotic opposite in Jeffrey's imagination. Following Dorothy home to the Deep River Apartments, Jeffrey is, in the film's most startling extended episode, drawn into voyeurism, sadomasochism and the unexplored dark side of his own character. In this sequence, he watches Miss Rossellini's Dorothy be tormented by the inimitable Dennis Hopper, who plays the most abusive, frightening psycho of his screen career. And that's really saying something.<br/><br/>Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best understood in terms of sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for. Both Miss Dern and Mr. MacLachlan - the ''Dune'' star who is the straight man of the piece, and resembles a young Robert Vaughn -do a fine job in a more controlled, normal mode that in its own way seems equally demented. The cinematography, by Frederick Elmes, has a constant edge, in both its exaggeratedly sunny stages and its murky ones. Weather it's dimly lit or lush and bright like the reds of Dorothy's apartment, it's amazing looking. A brilliant and unforgettable classic with a surprisingly underrated rating on IMDb.<br/><br/>10/10 Blue Velvet is a film about things that are hidden, within small towns, large cities, and within people. It's a film about surfaces, and that what you see is almost always not what you get. In the film, a young man discovers a human ear in a grass field, in the small town of Lumberton, where human ears should not be found and certainly don't belong, it definitely does not fit in with the perfectly manicured green lawns and white picket fenced homes. He proceeds with the investigation, along with the help of the wholesome, high-school sweetheart Sandy Williams, whose father is the towns detective. They are introduced to Lumberton's seedy, hidden underworld, home to prostitution, drug trade and violence and one of the most infamous cinema villains every created - Frank Booth. The film transcends from a tale about what lies beneath, to a tale about good vs. evil, good being Jeffrey, evil being Frank.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an amazing, jolting and exhilarating ride. But rides are not always good ones, despite their intensity and ability to shock. Ultimately, it's an exhausting film. The violence and profanity is extreme, as well as the ritualistic sex scenes and in 1986, it was unheard of to exhibit such taboos in such an explicit way, especially in American cinema. It was like the "Psycho" of it's time, causing such a controversy and an infamous debate on it's artistic merit by movie sensai Roger Ebert - who protested that Isabella Rossellini was used in a degrading manner. But beyond all the controversy, debate, Blue Velvet is a actually an excellent, original and beautiful film. Its cinematography is amazing, and watching it in widescreen DVD format is stunning. It's almost as good as it looked in the theater. I am quite sick of everyone bashing Kyle MacLachlan for a so-called "bland" performance, for his character is suppose to be wooden and geeky - it isn't because of MacLachlan's poor acting ability, this also goes for Laura Dern's performance as Sandy. Isabella Rossellini is a revelation, and so is Dennis Hopper. The direction is superb, and Lynch's trademarks were truly established with Blue Velvet - red curtains, candles, small, tidy seemingly idealistic towns, highways at night, vintage pop music, diners, graphic violence, damage to the skull or brain etc.<br/><br/>This is a must-see, I'm not promising you will like it, but you won't forget a film like this easily, nor will you see one as powerful and thought provoking. Suburbia and cinema were never the same after David Lynch's sick 'n sexy adult erotic and haunting fairytale that dips below the surface of apple-pie America. Eever since its release 23 years ago, Blue Velvet has come to symbolize an entire new way of looking at small town America; burrowing beneath its apparently wholesome surface to unearth scandal, drug abuse, perversity and torture. The most astonishing achievement of this repellent but compulsive widescreen, visually rich masterpiece is that it leaves this facade intact. At the end of the film, despite the fact that everything has changed, people have died, and innocence has been lost, the sun is still shining, birds are still chirping, love is in the air. The horrors we have witnessed have been magically absorbed into everyday, suburban life. What has changed, however, is the viewer, us. Like all visionary masterpiece filming, Blue Velvet leaves us feeling altered, for good or ill - we are changed because of this daring brilliance forever.<br/><br/>It altered other people, too. For example, it revived the career of washed up Dennis Hopper, in a role where he raved, swore, screamed and tore the screen apart as a psycho gas-snorting gangster. Isabella Rossellini established herself as a serious dramatic actress that defined her from her career as a cosmetics spokeswoman and a model. The film also confirmed the genius of its director, David Lynch. Blue Velvet really put him on the map. His nightmarish, bizarre cult debut Eraserhead had made him a director to keep watch on, however mainstream audiences did not take note until it became a midnight movie hit. The Elephant Man proved his idiosyncrasies could a survive a relatively mainstream project. Then Dune almost ruined his career, failing on almost every level. Blue Velvet came almost out of nowhere, and saved Lynch from obscurity. It erupted out of a black hole and caused a storm in Hollywood when it was released.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan plays the fresh faced Jeffrey, who finds an ear in a grass field in his wholesome all-American North Carolina town. The camera sums up what Blue Velvet is about, it digs beneath the freshly cut grass, to find a chaotic orgy of scrambling bugs and roaches. Jeffrey is eventually lured into the seedy underbelly of apple-pie Americana by the damaged torch singer Dorothy Vallens. He finds more than he bargained for with the crazed Dennis Hopper's unforgettable icon villain Frank Booth.<br/><br/>Plainly put, there has never been anything like Blue Velvet. Plenty of movies that followed stole freely its vision of corrupted idealism in suburbia - The Virgin Suicides, Donnie Darko, American Beauty and TV's Desperate Housewives. But it's sumptuous, operatic, morbidly funny vision of good vs. evil has never been equaled. The cinematography is beautiful and compelling. Lynch may have bordered the more extreme with 1997's Lost Highway and 2001's Mulholland Drive, which are both brilliant surrealist shockers - but nothing manages to get under your skin like Blue Velvet. And the fact that it still manages to shock today is a testament not only to its brilliance but to it's power to engross. An amazing, beautiful and provocative film. Before 1986, rarely would you see an American film as daring as Blue Velvet. The film uncovered sexual perversion and sadistic violence in an iconic serene setting where safety and innocence is always assumed -- modern day American suburbia. Now that we have "American Beauty" and countless other Blue Velvet knock-offs, the film should seem quite un-original. But Blue Velvet is just as shocking, just as powerful and just as raw as the very day it sent shock-waves around the movie industry. There had never been anything like it and there probably never will be again. Think about how little we see an American art film let alone one like Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>The film evokes so many human emotions and is so thematically deep. A common criticism of this film is its pretentiousness and that it exists merely for shock value, but there is so much to this film that keeps it from being your 'average thriller'. There is so much deep symbolism and such lush attention to detail. The film could be read as an allegory for the conscious and unconscious spectator; Jeffrey is exactly that, engaging in fetishism and grappling with his conscious and unconscious desires. It can be read as a dream of one of the main character's, like Lynch's most recent works -- "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Dr.". With the viewer, left to interpret what is real and what is not. Either way, Blue Velvet is not an exercise in hollow controversy-grabbing sleazy sex and violence. The films memorable visuals are some of the best I have ever seen, and watching this on HD DVD is truly an experience. The rich reds of Dorothy's lipstick and the soft pinks of her apartment, the blue velvet, the red roses and white picket fenced suburban homes even the dark as night moments, everything looks stunning.<br/><br/>Certainly not for the faint hearted, a lot of the film is very hard to stomach, but still a beautiful and haunting film. Blue Velvet movie is incredible on so many levels, don't judge, don't search just watch and take in the scenery, thats the point. Interpretations are for repeated viewings, of which "Blue Velvet" is certainly worthy of. I decided to rent this movie after hearing about its acclaim. Honestly, I was disappointed. Millions of miles from being a cinematic masterpiece, and just as far from being unredeemable trash, Blue Velvet is a maddening--yet never dull--exercise in Hollywood futility, tastelessly hollow controversy-mongering pretentious violence and sexuality. Beautifully detailed and designed scenes, with well acted performances and a mediocre plot save the film from being utter attention seeking trash. Blue Velvet seems to lack the psychological and sexual politics so many people have read into. To me it was nothing other than your average thriller. I can see why people enjoyed it, but it isn't entirely worth the acclaim it gets. The film certainly is an experience but it falls short on being the masterpiece people perceive it to be. Overall, Blue Velvet adds up (in the most contrived way possible)...but it doesn't add up to much. It's dull and often very unengaging, many scenes seem to exist purely for the sake of being shocking and daring, when really it's just pretentious but it isn't completely terrible. A decent thriller but certainly nothing special.<br/><br/>5/10 Time, or familiarity hasn't diminished Blue Velvets power to amaze and shock viewers. Nearly 24 years old, its still has fresh and provocative as it was in 1986. I first saw this film in the cinema and remember being absolutely mesmerized. I have seen it about five times since, and it is still as amazing and powerful as it was 24 years ago. The film packs some of the most well constructed suspense scenes I have ever seen. It really does keep you on the edge of your seat, in a kind of 'Hitchock' way. It features an incredible performance by Dennis Hopper, in his role as one of the most notorious villains ever to grace the silver screen. The look and feel of Blue Velvet is stunning, and seeing it on DVD for the first time captures it perfectly. The colors and imagery of this film will be burned into your retinas for weeks after you've watched it. From things as simple as roses and fire trucks, to underground bugs and construction yards this movie looks beautiful.<br/><br/>David Lynch's great skill as a director is his ability to aim right for the hind-brain - the unreasoning, alligator brain where the primal self lives. His work tends to hit there first, and then ricochet to the reasoning self. That's why his work is so evocative. Critics and audiences alike struggled to "explain" Mulholland Drive, and while a sensible explanation for it is possible, it sort of misses the point. These films are waking dreams - or nightmares - that, like paintings or pieces of music, try to touch something deeper than the intellect. You can't read a Beethoven symphony like a novel, you can't play Edvard Munch's "The Scream" on a musical instrument, and you can't understand Blue Velvet in terms of ordinary realism. To do so is to run screaming from it in terror or disgust, as I initially did.<br/><br/>But taken for what it is - a kind meditation on the darkness inside - you start to see the outrageousness of this film in a different light. You start to see that the characters are not so much two-dimensional freaks as they are embodiments of primal forces we all have inside of us. In Frued's moth-eaten old psychoanalytic terms (really a poor way of approximating, but it's the best I can do), Frank Booth is the hedonistic Id. Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) is the pure and virtuous Superego, and Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle McLaughlin) is the ego - the waking part of us torn between the two.<br/><br/>You most likely won't need any convincing if your a David Lynch fan, but for those of you who have not seen Blue Velvet, you really are missing out. It certainly is an unforgettable experience, regardless of whether you like it or not. Blue Velvet is undoubtedly one of the most controverisal, talked about movies of the 80s. It is a landmark in David Lynch's film career, and one of the first 'mainstream', well-known American films to feature graphic sexual violence. But does it stand the test of time? Is it still a film worth seeing? And is it still as powerful and raw today? The answer is defiantly yes. Blue Velvet still holds a lot of power, especially on initial viewings. After seeing the film as many times as I have, however, it is less unflinching and shocking but the power is still there. It's similar in many ways to 'A Clockwork Orange'. Blue Velvet may even be the 80s version -- both films are rampant with sexual violence, violence in general over there artistic merit.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is still an amazing film that holds many hidden messages. David Lynch is brilliantly for not giving into fans and revealing them. It gives us viewers a chance to speculate and make up our own interpretations. The cast is brilliant, but the standout is obviously Dennis Hopper's performance as Frank Booth - one of the most terrifying, insane villains to ever grace the screen. Isabella Rossellini's performance as the beautiful, bright red lipstick wearing, broken Dorothy Vallens is also a revelation. Blue Velvet is a must-see for film fanatics and people in general, i cannot guarantee you will enjoy it, but one thing i can guarantee is that you will not forget it. Lumberton is a great city. There are nice people, and the crossing guard is always there for the children, and the grass is always green. This place is extremely clichéd, and writer/director David Lynch wants us to know that. But underneath this perfect little town lies a mystery involving a crazed nitrate sucking, sex crazed lunatic, an abused woman, and a severed human ear.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) has come home from college to see his injured father. When walking around, Jeffrey finds a human ear on the grass, and shows it to a police detective, but nothing becomes of the case. Jeffrey begins going around with the detective's daughter Sandy (Laura Dern), and the clues lead them to a night club singer's apartment. Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini) is that singer, and she has ties to many criminals, including her maniac boyfriend Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who Jeffrey believes might be involved in the missing ear case. Chaos ensues when Frank finds Jeffrey at Dorothy's apartment.<br/><br/>Analogies and metaphors are prevalent in this movie where nothing is as it seems. This film was written on two levels, one a literal narrative, and the other seems to be on a metaphorical level. The literal level is good, in that it tells an interesting story with an original plot and smart characters, and on the metaphorical level it's fun to pick this film apart.<br/><br/>The direction here is stellar. The camera angles and shots are all great. The sets are unique and range from the norm to eerie, as they are supposed to. The characters are well acted and well developed, especially Dennis Hopper. Maybe he isn't as well developed, but his performance is brilliant. During the film you may find yourself wanting to shoot him in the head.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the story of the bottom layer of a typical town. You have to peal back the top layer to examine this one. And in this film is a bizarre, but great story and a memorable cast of characters.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. R for strong sexuality/nudity, violence and language. How do you begin to describe "Blue Velvet"? In it, a college student who's returned home to visit his ailing father discovers a severed ear in a field close to his neighborhood. This ear becomes a portal into the sinister underbelly of the idyllic town of Lumberton, North Carolina.<br/><br/>Given the fact that this film was written and directed by David Lynch, you ought to expect a unique viewing experience. In a nutshell, this is a mystery with a distinct surrealist bent. For the most part, though, it mainly sticks to a tried and true formula, albeit infused with a heightened reality that gives the subject matter new life.<br/><br/>Overall the cast is pretty good with a couple of standout performances; namely, Dennis Hopper as the terrifyingly unhinged 'heavy' and Isabella Rossellini as the requisite 'femme fatale'. I'm less impressed by Kyle MacLachlan & Laura Dern, though that's probably because their characters' wholesomeness made them less compelling.<br/><br/>Lynch's direction is immensely interesting and turns out to be strangely well-suited to the material. The surrealist touches set this film apart from almost all other Hollywood films, excepting others from Lynch like "Mulholland Drive". Lynch also makes some excellent use of music here. The score reinforces the tone of the film and soundtrack selections like Bobby Vinton's "Blue Velvet" and Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" prove to have been well-chosen.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend this film but I am certain that it will not appeal to a certain segment of the movie-going public. If you like daring, original films give this one a try. It's a shame this movie isn't in the top 250. I saw Blue Velvet when I was 17, and I really enjoyed it. It instantly jumped onto my list of favorite movies. I don't usually like a movie simply for being weird, but when it's both bizarre and brilliant I regard it as a masterpiece. When I watched it another time, alone at night with the sound rolling high, then I was more or less awestruck by the experience and continued to sit by the TV to let it sink in. <br/><br/>I think Blue Velvet's plot is one of the greatest aspects with the movie. It's complex in its simplicity. I guess it is up to the audience to grasp meaning from the picture, reading behind the lines, interpret the symbolism or "going underneath" as Mr Lynch would have said. The movie is an odyssey into mystery. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie was outstanding, in my opinion. Yes, it was corny and dull at times, but the only thing that did was to increase the atmosphere in the strange town of Lumberton. The acting was not misplaced at all, it was clever. The so-called dullness also made contrasts between the "regular people" in the town, and the more psychotic Frank Booth. Dennis Hopper delivers one of cinema history's greatest performances, maybe even surpassing Gregory Peck in "To Kill a Mockingbird". <br/><br/>Somehow I think this movie is more violent than both "Evil Dead" and "Bad Taste". For me, Frank Booth was some kind of "evil incarnate", therefore leaving the presence of violence just by gazing. Even though it might be great fun to watch Steven Seagal "jumping" around and punching bad guys, the suspense in this movie is a much greater thrill, by far, and kept me awake without any problem. Some scenes are long and some scenes doesn't include Dennis Hopper, but those are the scenes one is forced- or willingly have to think to find a meaning in the silence. Those are the best scenes. <br/><br/>One could say Blue Velvet is abrasive, yet it is stunningly beautiful if one has the guts to look a little closer. A better word would be 'unearthly', because it is out of this world! This movie has a little bit of everything. Blue Velvet is one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen, It has the David Lynch dark sense of humor, It has the visionary genius of David Lynch, and It has a great element of observation of what lies behind the normal suburban town. It rally is a town of two universes and he takes into a bizarre world. It gives me the same feeling as Billy Wilder's masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard. Every place has a frank booth or a corrupt cops or something, no place is perfect. The film is very Bunuelian in a dark and funny way. It also reminds me of Bunuel because it deals with good people dealing with wrong urges. The character played by Kyle Machlaclan seems like an extension of David Lynch to me, mostly because I heard Lynch and machlachlan say that exact same thing. The casting was brilliant. The Machlaclan character suddenly has this strange urge of voyeurism and can't help it, but he is not a bad person. Dennis Hopper was brilliant as the crazy gang leader addicted to ether. 4th best film of the 80's behind Raging Bull, Ran, and Blade Runner. It's enigmatic that's I have to say about David Lynch's Blue Velvet.To describe it,seems rather difficult because surrounding a simple looking storyline is quite stunning cinematography,powerful camera work & deep music in which you just want to lost a while... But that wont happen,because you would rather try to question the strangeness of movie.Well,its quite interesting to know what makes Lynch,a director different from others in Hollywood?? Anyone who has followed Lynch's work regularly can answer it and few of those comments are like ambiguous,genius,stupid,strange and so on. Even the critics or movie connoisseur fails to explain the weirdness behind his stories. So its only Mr.lynch,who know what he is presenting in front his audience.May be he wants to bring his nightmare live on screen or he just likes to fool around his viewers,as after dedicating 100-120 minutes they don't get anything.....at least in terms of story!!!<br/><br/>But then those who hates David Lynch's films will be most satisfied by BLUE VELVET,because it is least ambiguous among others.Its much better than Mullholland Dr. and Lost Highway because it don't let its viewer gets diverted in between.....<br/><br/>Story basically deals with two teenagers who in their excitement get involved in the mystery surrounding the night club singer Isabella. Well whatever be the storyline but the matter is presented in a very stunning manner which is quite appreciable.<br/><br/>No wonder its among the best of David Lynch's movie and very nearly a masterpiece. David Lynch's map of the terrain between wet dream and horrific nightmare, Blue Velvet reaffirmed the director's status as one of the most vital, original talents in American film-making, and achieved a mood and tone which would indelibly influence popular culture for the remainder of the 20th century and is still doing so today. Though much of the film revolves around a compelling, lurid mystery -- executed in a tense, economical manner that might have made Alfred Hitchcock proud -- Blue Velvet is more interested in the mysteries of desire and the horrors of unchecked deviance. It is about the destruction of a seemingly peaceful suburban setting. And the moment Blue Velvet came out, it duly attracted critical acclaim and controversy in about equal amounts. The Academy of Motion Pictures, to prove they are not entirely curmudgeons, saw fit to nominate Lynch for a Best Director Oscar that year.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet can also be seen as a dry run for many of the themes that Lynch would air in his cult TV series Twin Peaks (which aired from 1990-1). Both Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks feature a labyrinthine mystery involving kinky sex, drug running and kidnaping, all centered around a beautiful woman. In Twin Peaks Lynch also established a similar striking symbolic contrast between the facade of normalcy and the secret underbelly of a small nowhere USA logging town. Blue Velvet is a dark masterpiece of human depravity, one that has remained as powerful today as it was on its first release. David Lynch's bizarre mystery Blue Velvet is for me the defining moment in his career. Here he explores his key themes of dark desires and dreams through the ideal world of suburban Americana. It is delved into using complex Fraudian themes as we enter a nightmare world where everything is not as it seems under the surface. At the fold, Kyle McLachlan's Jeffrey Beaumont is an everyday teenager drawn into a dark, dreamlike world in which he is sexually adolescent. We are taken on a dark journey with him with what could be his sexually repressed, psychotic alter-ego Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth (the nastiest bastard of recent cinema) and his sexually perverse torture of night club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosellini). The film is full of lurid colours and dark, expressive compositions, with Lynch brilliantly capturing his delicately composed, ambiguous dreamscapes right up until the final frame in a masterful ending supported superbly by my favourite composer Angelo Badalamenti's brilliant score. The phrase "magnum opus" is used to define the greatest work of an artist. And as Citizen Kane is to Welles, The Godfather is to Coppola, and even Star Wars is to Lucas; Blue Velvet is and always will be to David Lynch, whose other efforts include the more mainstream The Elephant Man and the cult phenomenon Twin Peaks series, which bears a strikingly similar atmosphere to this film.<br/><br/>Much like a diamond, a film like Blue Velvet is a truly unique event that will undoubtedly be cherished by cinephiles forever. Its significance in film history as one of the most influence, shocking films is indisputable. In a film world known as 'Hollywood', thriving of mindless action films that consist nothing of explosions and more explosions, a film like Blue Velvet is like a needle in a haystack. It took sex and bizarre, graphic violence and put it into small-town suburbia. The slow success made it mainstream and paved way for shows like Twin Peaks, Desperate Housewives and films like American Beauty and Happiness. Sleaze lurking in suburbia was revolutionized because of this film.<br/><br/>Although it operates and appears like a typical stylish neo-noir erotic crime drama, Blue Velvet is so rich, layered, complex, and confusing that to summarize it in this review would be a pointless and impossible task. With Blue Velvet, David Lynch perfectly creates a simple, alluring and picturesque small town atmosphere filled with palm trees and diners that masks a much darker underbelly. With a fullscreen aspect ratio, Lynch does some incredible settings. From the beautiful backdrop of swaying blue velvet in the opening credits, to the lush colors of Dorothy's apartment, this is an absolutely enthralling film. That's "Blue Velvet" she's singing, and that's blue velvet he's got in his mouth. Dennis Hopper combines pure evil with moral degeneracy in a style not to be forgotten in this original shocker from David Lynch. The juxtaposition of the sleepy logging town with the depraved Hopper and his sick crew really makes the evil stand out. Laura Dern, playing a fifties-style sweetheart, is likewise an apt foil for the compromised and befouled Isabella Rossellini (Ingrid Bergman's daughter, lest we forget) who plays a small town chanteuse with some very kinky sexual needs. Kyle MacLachlan stars as a Nancy Drew wanna-be who gets in a couple of fathoms over his head.<br/><br/>The plot is as clever as the devil, surprising us at several turns, yet at no time does it go beyond anything reasonable. The characters are vivid, memorable and entirely believable. This is very close to a great movie. To nit-pick I'd have to say that the feel good resolution could have used a touch of Tabasco, and I was a little annoyed at being lead to believe that the father was a bad cop; in fact I have the feeling that Lynch had another ending in mind but gave us the old style Hollywood finale as a second thought.<br/><br/>Rossellini and her apartment-a simple, but exquisitely designed set-will probably stay with me through the next millennium. Also indelible is Hopper sucking on oxygen or nitrous to turbo himself up to do dirty deeds. The bit from Dean Stockwell as the clown-faced gay, lip syncing a Roy Orbison tune as we wait to see what he and Hopper are going to do to MacLachlan, made my skin crawl. Lynch fills out the world of his 1986 classic Blue Velvet so lovingly, and with such care and imagination, and attention to detail (and to the odd, essential quirks of life), that, surreal as it is, this world seems wholly authentic to us. Because Lynch is not afraid to "dream' his movies, he fills his world with the kind of "abritrary' touches that make up real life. Blue Velvet's small town filled with eccentric, lovable characters and beautiful scenery is on par with his equally brilliant Twin Peaks seires. And his mise en scene here, far from being merely the backdrop to his "plot," is actually central to it (and even takes precedence over it). The one grows organically out of the other, in fact, for, as in all true myths (and in dreams also), the two are inseparable. Because in life, there is no plot, obviously (save that written by God, or Chance), only an endless, infinite and unimaginably intricate unfolding of scenes, acts, events, encounters, gestures, words, sounds, smells. In a word--phenomena, endlessly spilling out and colliding and spinning off and resounding with all the crazy random beauty of pollen in the wind. There may be patterns in such chaos, but if so, they are infinite, varied, and eternally overlapping, interacting. And so the patterns we choose to isolate are simply that: their meanings is merely the meaning we have chosen to impose upon the chaos. For Lynch, the mystery of the world is inseparable from the mystery of us--the mystery of perceiving, which is the greatest mystery of them all. Something is out there, Lynch seems to be saying, because something is making us perceive. It's up to us, then, to seek it out, and even if we know we can never hope to understand it, we can at least try. What else are we here for? The alternative is simply too dull, too dispiriting, to entertain--that's there's nothing out there, nothing hidden or inexplicable, and that what we think is all there is. (The insanity of solipcism is the only thing that's unthinkable in Lynch's world.) To Lynch, the options are plain--either we know it all, and the answers are just what we choose to invent, in which case there's no sense in asking questions at all. Or--we know nothing, and no answers are possible, so all there is for us to do is ask the most exciting, enchanting, impossibly impertinent questions we can dream up. To Lynch, the world is a strange world, not because we do not understand it, but because that's the way it is--it's nothing but strangeness, that's what makes it the world (such stuff as dreams are made of). Since, for Lynch, there is nothing stranger than "normality," so, by the same token, the strange is the only "normal" thing there is. And seeing as we have made the world thus, by perceiving it, interpreting and assembling it, piece by piece, with our own thoughts and senses, then we must be mysteries, too.<br/><br/>With Blue Velvet, Lynch succeeds in perhaps the highest single accomplishment art can aspire to (at a human level, anyway): he shows us that, if reality is a dream and dream reality, then we, as both the dreamers and the dream, are the ultimate unfathomables: we are strangers to ourselves Graphic sexual violence and Dennis Hopper's shockingly disturbing portrayal of a sadistic psychopath holding a sultry lounge singer's family hostage for her acquiescent brutalization provoked a storm of controversy around David Lynch's disturbing, dark and dreamlike mystery. Lynch's depiction of the cruelty, depravity and sickness lying just beneath the surface of a nice, friendly white picket-fenced America is not exactly subtle, but is remoursley gripping, compelling and stylish. Blue Velvet combines an air of twisted mystery with an ironic satire of Americana and a singular, chirpy, lightly stylized tone that strongly influence a number of imitations, including Lynch's own cult phenomenon series Twin Peaks.<br/><br/>Featuring an engaging Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern in roles they seem very fitting too play, caught up in a feverish, horrific murder mystery brought to the surface after the discovery of a human ear in a grass field. The two youngsters are caught up with Hopper's crazed, oxygen tank dependent kidnapper-killer-rapist-psycho (his insanely terrifying, obscenity spewing Frank Booth providing one of the most iconic, feared screen psychos) and brave Isabella Rossellini's bruised china doll Dorothy Vallens, the mysterious, seductive cabaret singer at his never tender mercy. All of this does not take place in a sprawling future city, or a brothel, but in an American everytown (where something is always somewhat out of place), home to tidy lawns and flowerbeds, an industrlised core, and populated with colorful diners school kids visit after a long day.<br/><br/>Clever use of innocunous pop ballads-most hauntingly the title song, laced through regular Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score heightens the atmosphere, as does the lush, compelling use of color. Blue Velvet's undisputed status as a disturbing, highly original and important piece of cinema is only a further testimony to the fact that this is a must see film experience. Just think about this for a moment. Every classic film, or every film that has made an impact was always a highly original one. There was nothing like it before it, and there probably never will be. Blue Velvet definitely falls into this category. No one had seen anything like it in 1986, which is why it horrified so many people. It was a rare movie experience, something that had not been seen before in American cinema. Because it made such an impact, so many people tried to re-create their own 'Blue Velvet' (American Beauty doesn't look so original anymore, does it?). Every film that uncovers seedy little secrets in a seemingly perfect suburbia owes its debt to Blue Velvet. Even director David Lynch's own cult series 'Twin Peaks' was inspired by this film. And that's just a small account of its influence.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a nearly flawless film. People that attack Laura Dern's performance need to re-evaluate the film. She is superb at capturing the innocence of a young all-American girl. Kyle MacLachlan is equally fantastic pre-Agent Dale Cooper in probably one of his most famous film roles. Isballa Rossellini and Dennis Hopper are the standouts, however, turning in bona-fide performances. Hopper made a comeback as the obsenity screaming, distraught and terrfying villain Frank Booth, while Isabella Rossellini broke into the acting spotlight with her performance as the broken night club singer with nothing left.<br/><br/>A lot of people say that this is David Lynch's most straightforward film. It is not straightforward. On an initial viewing it may seem like the usual crime drama, but it is far more complex. There is Opedial symbolism, and part of the film may be a dream (it is not explicitly stated), but there are many references to dreams ("In Dreams" by Roy Orbison is sung in a famous sequence). A truly memorable film experience not to be missed. In the erotic masterpiece Blue Velvet, David Lynch digs away at the
pervasive savagery and evil lurking in the shadows of a seemingly
normal, wholesome small town. When wide-eyed college student Jeffrey
Beaumont returns from a visit of his father in hospital, he comes
across a human ear buried under a grass field. The ear capitulates
Jeffrey into a dark murder mystery that gradually reveals his town's
darkest secrets, which are rustled from cover. Blue Velvet's sordid
plot-lines involving hardcore drug use, sexual perversion, and a
malevolent supernatural force shocked the movie industry and open doors
to a whole new realm of film-making. The fascinated aspects of Blue
Velvet are the quirky townspeople, heavy sex, violence and off-beat
atmosphere had a profound effect on cinema.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a unique, hugely entertaining murder mystery. And don't
be fooled, its not a typical, mechanical thriller that has nothing
under its glossy surface. It is fall of creepy Fraudian subtext and
heavy symbolism that makes Blue Velvet a complex, terrifyingly
nightmarish but beautiful classic and an intrepid piece of film-making
with rich and often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote
introspection amongst its viewers. Blue Velvet sure scared and repulsed me on my initial viewing. I was so absorbed by it, I had to give it a re-watching. So what is it about, I hear you ask? Blue Velvet is a gritty film about the dichotomy of everyday life. You have your tranquil, suburban existence full of normal folk. And then you have your deranged, violent, and perverted neighbors who like to terrorize the others. Let's get to know both groups a bit better through the course of this unsettling but wonderful film.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is set in a town that closely resembles the town at the centre of his cult television series 'Twin Peaks'. Its a woodsy, amiable close-knit town associated with the logging industry. Jeffrey Beaumont has returned from college due to his father's sudden illness. While walking home from the hospital, Jeffrey discovers a severed human ear in the thick grass of a field. He brings it to the police, where he meets his neighbor, Detective Williams, and later visits him at home to find out more about his gruesome discovery. Jeffrey is told to keep quiet about the ear & then he meets the detective's pretty high school senior daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern), on his way out of the house. She tips Jeffrey about an ongoing investigation into a woman singer who lives in an apartment building near the field where the ear was found. Soon, Jeffrey and Sandy are conspiring to investigate the woman singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) by having Jeffrey pretend to be a bug exterminator & sneak into her apartment to have a look around. What Jeffrey discovers is something that seems totally out of place in there amiable, friendly hometown. Dorothy is being held captive by the sadistic drug-addicted pervert Frank Booth -- he also has a knack for blue velvet and beer, namely, Pabst Blue Ribbon. And so begins a timeless tale of good vs. evil. However, Blue Velvet is set apart from being just one of those films.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is the thoughtful and controversial work of several creative people at the top of their game. David Lynch has masterfully directed a film that is both compelling and repulsive at times. Dennis Hopper brought to life the evil and sadistic Frank Booth without going over the top, as top-notch actors portraying screen villains often do. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern make an engaging pair of would-be detectives and believably naïve counterpoints to all the darker elements of the film. And then there's the wonderfully lush cinematography of Frederick Elmes coupled with the atmospheric soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti that make this a film experience not to be missed. Lets toast to a nice Heineken, err, sorry Frank, a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Very rarely in you're lifetime do you experience a life-changing film. Anything that literally makes you feel whats going on, something with strong emotional power, a timeless setting and universal themes. Blue Velvet definitely fits this category. David Lynch is a director well-known for taking risks; Blue Velvet is his most famous and is one of the best results. It is an astonishingly influential masterpiece, easily as much as touchstones like Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction or Star Wars. Its depiction of graphic violence or dysfunction in a picket-fenced, small town setting has spawned countless rip-offs (American Beauty, anyone?) -- some great, others not so great. Its easy to point out the 'Blue Velvet touch' in films.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jeffrey, a young man who has had to return to his small American hometown after his father falls ill. He discovers a human ear, of all things, in a grass field and decides to proceed with the investigation himself, with the assistance of his friend and soon-to-be girlfrien, the niave and innocent All-American girl Sandy. The two are led into a depraved underworld, an existence home to a disturbed and fractured nightclub singer and a depraved sadist. This is a brilliant film, on every level. The standout is Lynch's lush visual photography, with the rich reds and the blues, and even the monotone colours look beautiful. And Angleo Badalamenti's masterful scoe, which sinks deep into your consciousness like sand onto a sea floor. Then there are the amazing performances from every member of the stunning and extremely diverse cast. For all these reasons, Blue Velvet is an unforgettable film not to be missed. A lot has changed in cinema since 1986. The violence has become more extreme and distasteful, the sex is stronger, and overall, the conten is far more explicit. However, David Lynch's 1986 shocker Blue Velvet, which caused a storm of controversy on its initial release, remains as audacious and horrfying all these twenty-something years later. This can seldom be said about films, most of them weather terribly after their first release. The impact is no less than it was on its initial release. Despite all the imitations, spoofs and parodies, the cut-off ears, the haunting title song and eerie showtunes, the semingly perfect small town Americana, dancing midget prostitutes and strange obsession with logs has not diminished in the least. It's still a strange world, even if some of Lynch's tricks have become predictable.<br/><br/>Lynch has created a deep, meaningful drama full of subtle messages, ranging from social order and disorder, normal and abnormal sexuality, goodness and evil, while telling a classic American coming-of-age story set in a timeless small-town. The performances are first-rate, but I give my credit to Isabella Rossellini, who has taken such a risk in accepting an extremely difficult role, and pulled it off extremely well. Dennis Hopper, who brings a hailstorm of curse words, in his best, most well known performances. Blue Velvet is, quite simply, a must see. There it is, at seemingly subterranean depth, a feast for the insects: a decaying human ear. Appropriately, sound amplifies as we inch towards it, the microcosmic insect world rumbling at the volume of a busy city street. The portrait of a deteriorating extremity minding its own business in the centre of a lush green field is one of the many juxtapositions of beauty and sickness we'll see in Blue Velvet, a film in which the balance of good and evil in a small town is teetered by a visitor who, as exemplified by his wardrobe of neutral greys, straddles the divide. The interloper is a young man named Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan). He is your run-of-the-mill guy, although he has a taste for mystery. He happens upon the ear while refamiliarizing himself with Lumberton, where he grew up and where his father recently suffered a stroke, although had to leave for college. Jeffrey joins forces with the innocent, niave Sandy (Laura Dern), the daughter of town sheriff John Williams. She provides him with eavsdropped information from her father. At the centre of the information is a possible link, nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini).<br/><br/>Jeffrey, born curious, breaks into Vallens' apartment while the cat's away, so to speak, but is caught when he doesn't hear Sandy's warning signal that the chanteuse has returned. Despite her abhorrence for intruders, Dorothy stows him away in a closet upon the arrival of a second guest, an act we'll come to see as merciful. Peering out through louver doors, Jeffrey observes Dorothy's violent sexual abuse at the hands of the tragically unhinged Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), a leather-swathed nightmare of Oedipal frustration. This is Jeffrey's formal acquaintance with Lumberton's underbelly, and once he's tasted it, he wants more.<br/><br/>Jeffrey's temptations come to a boil once he, after assuming the roles of first her protector, then her saner lover, beats Dorothy during intercourse, becoming a version of Frank in the process. It's a film noir tradition for the hero to have his loyalties inverted--a "case" becomes a probing of the self, an excuse to explore and indeed challenge his humanity. Jeffrey is swiftly redeemed in the film's centerpiece, for my money the most transporting sequence ever committed to celluloid: kidnapped by Frank and his goons, he is brought to a drug den and subjected to a lip-synched performance of Roy Orbison's heartbreaking "In Dreams" by suave transvestite Ben (an enchanted Dean Stockwell). Unable to bear the deceptively simple song's emotional weight, Frank packs up his gang and (I'm paraphrasing this next development, natch) brings his hostage to a deserted patch of road, where he applies lipstick and vents his psychotic frustrations on Jeffrey.<br/><br/>The cast of Blue Velvet features standout performances. Kyle MacLachlan as the wide-eyed young man going through his rites-of-passage. Dennis Hopper, mesmerizing and unhealthily iconic in a perversely charismatic role. Rossellini would weather a political hailstorm for her naked portrayal of a guilt-wracked sadomasochist; Blue Velvet's disparagers, an outspoken lot, saw her as victimized off-camera, too, by virtue of playing the script as written. I'm torn: the film inevitably exploits Ms. Rossellini's body, but Dorothy Vallens is a juicy part, and such monstrosities occur in real life--we can wave the banner of political correctness, or give the issue of rape its ugly due. It's a fine line, to be sure.<br/><br/>The phenonomen of Blue Velvet will never die down. It has gone from cult classic to widley-recognized classic, and one of the greatest works in cinema history, hands down. Lynch's seminal, voyeuristic masterpiece is as scary as comedies get and as funny as realistically horrific psychodramas can be. Highly recommended. David Lynch's perverse masterpiece hasn't dated at all since it first appeared. (OK, in terms of sex and violence it feels almost 'cosy' now so long as your idea of cosy is Ma and Pa Kettle in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre). It's a great 'small town movie' and it's to Lynch's abiding credit that even without all the perversity lying just beneath the surface he can still make this particular small town seem disquietingly dark and dangerous and few films, before or since, have succeeded in puncturing the myth of an apple-pie America like this one has.<br/><br/>It begins with a near-death experience and a little bit of mutilation and takes it from there. As Jeffrey, (Kyle MacLachlan), follows the trail of a severed ear he is like Alice going through the looking glass into Dante's Inferno for, being a David Lynch movie, things as we find them are never fully explained in anything resembling 'realistic' fashion. Suffice to say the trail leads him, first to the masochistic Dorothy, (Isabella Rossellini, who is certainly not in Kanas anymore), and then to the sadistic Frank, (a gloriously deranged Dennis Hopper who says he wanted the part because it reminded him of himself). And the murkier Jeffrey finds things outside of himself, the murkier he finds things within himself. Curiosity turns to voyeurism until Frank's unmitigated sadism begins to rub off on him. It's scary stuff, to be sure, but Lynch takes such perverse pleasure in making us squirm that all this sex and violence begins working its aphrodisiac effect on us, the audience. "Blue Velvet" is a classic and it's a highly enjoyable one. It is also a true original. Until I saw Blue Velvet, I thought that Hannibal Lector had to be one of the most evil, terrfying villains in the history of cinema. My opinion was completely changed by this film. Frank Booth is the eptimone of evil. Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance. But more on the film.... Blue Velvet begins with young-college student Jeffrey Beaumont's father, who collopases from a stroke while watering his garden.<br/><br/>Jeffrey has to return from college to be of aid to his father, however while returning from a visit, he finds a human ear in a grass field. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, and the seductive woman he is holding captive (the wonderfully broken and desperate Isabella Rossellini). Also making an appearance is Dean Stockwell, who purrs through his role as Frank's oh-so-suave, feminine buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly, beautiful austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score. Blue Velvet is a highly disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone. But for a viewer who wants to see the cinematic world rocked off its foundations, David Lynch has created an ideal little film for you. In 1986 a movie appeared which changed the world. It horrified and repulsed some, it received total admiration and total negativity. A film that can trigger such an emotional response is certainly something very special. Very few movies cause such a scandal. Along with Blue Velvet, perhaps "Basic Instinct" (1992), "Pulp Fiction" (1994), "Last Tango in Paris" (1974) and "A Clockwork Orange" (1971). All of these films have caused a lasting impact in the film industry. Something that continues to be felt today, and will remain doing so for god knows how long. The reason Blue Velvet outraged people was because of its bizarre, disturbing depiction of sex and crazed, horrific and graphic violence, and it doesn't take place in a big city, but a small American town that at first seems to be totally normal. It seems like the kind of town were the police consume coffee and donuts on daily basis, the mothers and grandmothers bake apple pie, the neighbors always wave and the homes are always kept in a clean, presentable condition. But something unexplainable isn't quite right. Something is hiding below the surface wanting to be opened. The person that reveals the underworld is Jeffrey, whose "key" to this world is a human ear...something that has come out of a murder case. Jeffrey finds it, investigates the ear, and finds something that both damages and excites him.<br/><br/>Standout performances and direction from David Lynch, Isabella Rossellini, icon Dennis Hopper, Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern. Some people say this film is simple, others say it is layered and is full of symbolic metaphors and messages. You'd have to pretty stupid to miss all of the references and subliminal messages that abound the film. No, its not simple coming-of-age drama/thriller, it's a film that defies categorization. It isn't pretentious art. It is very intricate and deep American art/surrealism. There is, really, nothing like this film and probably never will be. Its a cultural landmark. David Lynch is a bit of a mad genius. He's eccentric about his films (he doesn't like scene selection on his DVDs, as he believes they need to be watched in their entirety every time). I'd seen Twin Peaks before, but my main introduction to Lynch was through this film, it was often brought up in movie discussion, and sparked additional public interest when David Lynch found success globally with Twin Peaks. It still manages to be discussed and anaylized today, so i thought i'd review it.<br/><br/>I guess the reason that Blue Velvet along with twin peaks and the elephant man is one of Lynch's favourite films is because its so straight-forward. Its not absurd and hard to access like Mulholland Dr. and Lost Highway (although, some people enjoy those kind of those puzzling movies). The plot centers around Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan), a young lad who, whilst in the midst of dealing with his father's recent stroke, discovers a severed ear in a field (yup, a human ear!). Jeffrey befriends Sandy, the daugther of a local detective (Laura Dern), leading him to conduct his own investigation based on her leads. Jeffrey soon finds himself involved in the life of Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a seductive but very mysterious woman tied to Frank (Dennis Hopper), a perverse, evil man at the center of Jeffrey's investigation into the missing ear.<br/><br/>In 1986, this film was huge, it was everywhere. It steamed a huge bowel of controversy soup. Probably because it featured perverse, strange and graphic sex, very explicit violence and strong inappropriate language, and Frank Booth -- a very, very dangerous and terrfying man. He is literally the eptimone of evil. He is psycho. As a result of the controversy surronding Booth and the movie, Blue Velvet has received essays, thesis', entire books written on it...so obviously I cant explain the film in the limited amount of space i've got here. As you may have gathered, this is an immensely intense film. Jeffrey, the main protagonist, is just a college kid- his life in suburbia is heavily contrasted to the 'underground' world of drugs, violence and bizarre sex acts he uncovers (there's a lot of clever visual metaphors throughout the film representing this). He has a sweet, clumsy sort of romance blooming with Sandy, but at the same time has a twisted sort of sexual relationship with Dorothy. Sandy is a figure of purity throughout the movie (although not all that pure- she dumps her boyfriend for Jeffrey, and is well-versed in her father's cases), but ultimately the movie hints at the fact that her idea of a happy, loving apple-pie, coffee-drinking society is probably never going to get past the realms of fantasy.<br/><br/>The more I write, the more I realise that trying to tell you, in words, why Blue Velvet is such a great movie is somewhat fruitless. It's a movie all about the experience of being slapped around, and a movie built more for post-watching discussion than the initial convincing stage. If you think you can take it (not everyone can, in my experience), slap this into your DVD player, dim the lights and prepare to be shocked by David Lynch's world. It is an unforgettable movie. Long before the white picket fences, red roses, and suburban family dysfunction of American Beauty, there were the white picket fences, red roses, seemingly happy people, grub beetles, decaying ear, and small-town dysfunction of David Lynch's corrupt fantastia Blue Velvet, which has clearly inspired American Beauty's visual aspects. At a time when audiences were flocking to the sanitized rah-rah Americana of the Tom Cruise vehicle Top Gun, the spectacle of a snooping college student forced to strip at knife-point by a crazed, masochist lounge singer just before a spectacularly profane, gas-sniffing psychopathic sadist named Frank Booth interrupts their encounter and does sexual gymnastics involving pieces of a blue velvet rode was appealingly, or appallingly, subversive and forever changed cinema. It sent shock-waves throughout the world. People left theater screenings at the pure disgust and absurdity of it all, it provoked endless controversy...but now, its status as a classic is pinned firmly in cinema history.<br/><br/>The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town. It's a town where every day has blue skies, perfectly manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple people. It is complete with diners, apple-pie eating families, over-hanging tree-lined streets and cosy homes. Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures straight out of fifties television shows. But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long. Quickly an old man who is watering his lawn falls down, near death, presumably from a heart-attack. The camera pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass. Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs. The idyllic town is only pretty on the surface. Underneath the top layer of goodness lies a darker, seedier town that has been long hidden from the eyes of most of its citizens.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern's characters are delving deeper and deeper into the darker side of the small town. MacLachlan finds a dismembered human ear on his walk home from the hospital one afternoon buried beneath overgrown layers of grass. Finding such a macabre item in his hometown sparks a quest to discover who's head the ear could belong to and why it was removed. He involves the good girl Laura Dern in his quest and they sink into darker waters. To tell more of the plot is to give away too much. I'll just say that it is not for the weak of heart, although I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper shines as one of the creepiest, mentally unstable (even beating out screen legends Kathy Bates of Misery, Glen Close in Fatal Attraction and probably even Darth Vader). And he is a completely different villain to Hannibal Lector or a Freddy Kruger. This is not some crazed psychopath lurking in the corner. Sure he is psychotic, and maniacal, but versions of him can be found almost nightly in any major city newspaper. He is not a homicidal maniac, but a violent, evil man made even more so by his addiction to various unnamed drugs. One of the sentiments after watching Blue Velvet is that "I'll never watch that again", or "WOW" or "that was a masterpiece", I've asked different people, and many of them got a combination of those three after seeing this film. Sure, your entitled to being scared and horrified, but there is no denying this is a masterpiece. It is quite simple for the average viewer that likes to park their brains at the door when watching a movie, yet very layered and full of symbolism for the film-buff that likes repeated viewings and films that have hidden messages. The brutally honest performances, articulate and beautiful style, and the movie's sexual and violent shock value save the story from becoming too stale or uninspiring. Blue Velvet, all these years later, still seems completely original, invigorating and unsurpassed. It wouldn't matter if every film after Blue Velvet in David Lynch's career sucked, because Blue Velvet will always be his masterpiece. The things, along with Twin Peaks, will remember him for.<br/><br/>Everyone assumes that Blue Velvet opens with the infamous ear-in-the-grass scene, but the film's opening is even more disturbing than that. A suburban fantasia of white picket fences, blood-red roses, waving fireman, happy children and a man watering his lawn gives way to the disturbing moment when the watering man collapses and the camera pans down to dirt level where a number of horrific insects are scrabbling in the dirt at the base of the lawn. The soundtrack changes from Leave It to Beaver-style music to the loud, gnawing, electric saw-like noises emitted by the creatures. Only subsequent to this scene does Jeffrey Beaumont (a wide-eyed, snoopy Kyle MacLachlan) find the ear in a field of overgrown weeds.<br/><br/>The ear leads Jeffrey through a sordid underworld involving kidnapping, masochism, drug-dealing, and murder. But while there's a whole lot of plot in Blue Velvet, Lynch's more elemental concern is with unearthing the truth behind the façade (i.e. showing what lurks under the lawn). Even the blue velvet dress that chanteuse Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rossellini) wears hides a secret  namely, the bruises on her body which are delivered by the vile Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper, in the role that brought him back to the limelight).<br/><br/>When Jeffrey asks the niave Sandy (Laura Dern), the prim girl on whom he has a crush, why there is so much trouble in the world, the answer is clear  without it, our lives would be far duller. Jeffrey himself admits that he loves a mystery and the curiosity that his desire entails is the same one that fuels Lynch's own vision. When Frank says to Jeffrey, "You're like me," it could be Lynch speaking to the audience. We want to know more, even if what we find out hurts or is ugly. Like the scene of an accident, we cannot look away. Fueled by a vibrant and always-surprising surrealism, Blue Velvet reminds us that the dreams and fantasies of our subconscious are dangerous and thrilling; it's surface reality that is mundane.<br/><br/>This is definitely a film worth watching multiple times. It gets better and better on every viewing. There are so many questions, and at the same time, so many answers, which seem to bring up more questions. Blue Velvet is a timeless film. David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town, Norman Rockwell-esquire America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, brutality and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class suburban homes and tree-lined, picturesque lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of dark, unsettling nightmare.<br/><br/>After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.<br/><br/>Although Lynch stumbled a few times with a few unmemorable films("Dune", "Wild at Heart") where his genius is less evident, Blue Velvet pays the price each time. A film that gets even better on every viewing, Lynch has stripped away innocence to expose a repressed perversity underneath all of us. Watching Blue Velvet is comparable to riding a roller coaster. It is an extremely wild experience that can evoke emotion and produce a both a positive and negative response. For me, it was defiantly a positive experience. Not quite as bizarre as "Erasrhead" or "Mulholland Dr.", film concerns Jeffrey, who lives in the sleepy, picturesque Lumberton USA - a traditional American small town with all the traditional trimmings - Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle McLachlan) is bored. All his friends have long left town, and with his father in hospital after a heart attack and unable to run the family hardware store any longer, Jeffrey has no choice but to help out. But his boredom turns to fascinated curiosity one afternoon when, wandering through a grassy field, he discovers something unexpected on the ground - a human ear. Not repulsed in the slightest, he brings the ear to the attention of the local police, and keenly follows the progress of the case. But when he's bluntly told by local detective Williams to forget the whole thing, Jeffrey becomes determined to solve the mystery - aided to no small extent by the detective's daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern). Before long, a dark, seedy and repellently evil side to the town begins to surface, as Jeffrey meets failed lounge singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), the out-of-control Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and a series of other characters that are far removed from small-town sweetness.<br/><br/>Of Lynch's "modern" films (with the exception of The Straight Story), Blue Velvet is undoubtedly the most linear in terms of story; Lynch plays out the first act as though he were doing a charmingly edgy '40s film noir pastiche, and it doesn't take long to get drawn in to this quirky but warm world and its characters, and the sheer mystery of it all. But Lynch has other plans; the level of tension is slowly, inexorably ratcheted up as Jeffrey brazenly gets all Famous Five about his investigations, and crosses the line into voyeurism. And then Frank Booth enters the picture, and everything goes to hell in a handbasket.<br/><br/>Despised by some, feared by those who haven't seen it and notorious and extremely famous or (in)famous for its explicit sexual content, Blue Velvet is not easy going for those who like their movies polite and huggable. But the confrontational material is an intrinsic part of the story and mood here - nothing's gratuitous, nothing is exploitative. It's one of the most exquisitely perfect movies ever made, but you only really see how perfect from a distance - it's a film that rewards multiple viewings, one which gets better with age (visually and stylistically, it's timeless) and an experience that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled. And almost 22 years on, it's as riveting, exciting and immersive as the day it was released - a genuine masterpiece. After going through somewhat of a rough phase of his career with the box office failure of the big budget sci-fi epic, David Lynch redeemed himself with his undisputed masterpiece "Blue velvet" - one of the greatest, bizarre and nightmarish films in the history of American film-making. Before its initial release in 1986, the cinematic American culture was use to straightforward, generally "happy" films. Blue Velvet's success, with its painful realism and its constant dip in and out of reality, changed that.<br/><br/>The film is about the sexual awakening of Jeffrey after the discovery of an underworld in his seemingly humble hometown. Actually, its more than that. I cannot really sum up what's it "about", because its about so many things, from the loss of innocence to the putrefaction of suburbia. Whatever you perceive the film to be, it doesn't really matter, its still an amazing film and confirms Lynch's status as a truly original filmmaker. Blue Velvet is a dark, nightmarish and intensly scary film. This could adequetlly sum all of David Lynch's films. His films are often filled with symbolism and it is easy to finish one of his films and have no real idea of what actually happened. They usually take two or three viewings, and a little research to get a good idea what the movie is actually trying to convey. Blue Velvet has a simpler plot that can generally be understood at a basic level upon first viewing, but there is plenty of symbolism and deeper meaning to make it "enjoyable" for further viewings. I put enjoyable in quotation marks because to many watching it is not an enjoyable experience. It is a movie deep seated in horror and mandess, with scenes that make you crawl under the covers and lock the doors. I recommend this, but I warn you first. Cinemphiles I'm guessing will jump to this film immediately....<br/><br/>The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town were everyone seems to know everyone. It's a town where every day there are blue skies, manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple, friendly people. Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures reminiscent of fifties television shows. But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long. They are just there to lure us into a false sense of hope, happiness and security. The false happiness is silenced completely when a man watering his lawn all of a sudden drops to the ground after what appears to be a heart attack. This is followed by the camera, which pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass. Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs. The idyllic town is only pretty on the surface. Underneath the top layer of goodness lies a darker, seedier town hidden from the eyes of most of its citizens.<br/><br/>The plot of the film revolves around Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern delving deeper and deeper into the darker side of the small town. MacLachlan finds a dismembered ear on his walk home from the hospital one afternoon. Finding such a macabre in his hometown sparks a quest to discover who's head the ear could belong to and why it was removed. He involves the good girl Laura Dern in his quest and they sink into darker waters. To tell more of the plot is to give away too much. I'll just say that it is not for the weak of heart.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper plays one of cinemas creepiest villains to date. His psychosis is even more terrifying in that it is so real. Here is no Freddy Krueger, or even a Hannibal Lector. This is not some crazed psychopath lurking in the corner. Sure he is psychotic, and maniacal, but versions of him can be found almost nightly in any major city newspaper. He is not a homicidal maniac, but a violent, evil man made even more so by his addiction to unnamed drugs.<br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini plays Dorothy Valens with such beauty and sadness it breaks your heart as it squirms your stomach. Her character has taken such horrible abuse over her life she has come to like and enjoy it. Mixed with heavy amounts masochism her performance is remarkable.<br/><br/>I have watched this with my friends, and two of them could not finish it, being repulsed and disturbed by the content and the overall madness. If you can stomach the violence, masochism and overall creepiness there is a lot of pure cinema to study... the film is a dark masterpiece, something you'd only imagine seeing in your nightmares. Will there ever be a movie like Blue Velvet? A film to cause such an impact, not just Passion of the Christ sized impact, but an impact that is felt globally. The Godfather, Apolocalpyse Now, Bonnie and Clyde, and of course, Blue Velvet -- three universally admired films that literally changed the way we see films. Why? Because these films deliver shock and power not for there on sake, there is not a single false gesture. And that sense of something precognitive, something that calls to you in your gut.<br/><br/>Though it was his fourth feature-length film, Blue Velvet was and remains Lynch's Rosetta stone, his Astral Weeks -- the glossary of ideas and images to which he has repeatedly returned over the past two decades, an ever-flowing wellspring of lipstick and fishnet, of lost highways and women in distress, of good Christian values at odds with the depths of human depravity. His most memorable, well-known, well-liked feature will always be this: because nothing can/will cause such an impact on audiences. Few movies have deeper roots in the primal allure of mystery and our thirst for those things dangerous and unknown. But equally, there is Lynch's unironic yearning for the superficial simplicities of life in iconic small towns like Blue Velvet's Lumberton, with their thick shellac of apple-pie diners and crossing guards and white-picket fences. Indeed, the Missoula-born director grew up in such places, and his movies are like the work of the quiet, unassuming neighbor kid who, by virtue of his anonymity, winds up knowing everybody's dirty business. This is David Lynch's America, and for two hours, it's a surreal and hugley exciting privilege to return there...so if your a first time viewer, re-disover the film (it takes at least two viewings or maybe more to be fully appreciated) or if you haven't yet seen it, well...my friend, your missing out! An essential masterpiece that has come to be regarded as one of the finest examples of American film-making, and deservedly so. Having been a big fan of this film for many years now, you'd probably assume I'm going to write a bias review on how the film is great, but I'm going to write this article from a broader prospective.... and yes, I can assure you this film is a masterpiece on the grandest scale. Although I'd like to go through what makes this film great, but that would take probably an entire book. The film is brilliantly crafted and epically told. Despite the fact that the film takes place in what is very distinctly an American town (home to everything associated with the term "Americana") - the story (a fable of the darker side of suburban existence and the corrupt world) could quite possibly take place anywhere in the world. It also manages to incorporate the timeless tale of the loss of innocence through our hero and protagonist Jeffrey.<br/><br/>The films plot is relatively simple, yet told with amazing scope. Jeffrey, a college student, has returned to his small, beautifully kept town after his father is hospitalized as a result of a mystery illness. While wandering home from a daily visit, Jeffrey discovers a human ear (yes, a human ear!) in a grass field and through his voyeuristic side, investigates the mystery; with the assistance of his high school girlfriend Sandy. What the two discover is a nightmarish underworld that their mom and apple pie pleasant family life has never prepared them for - S/M, kidnapping, murder, and various sexual perversions.<br/><br/>The timeliness of this reissue shouldn't be underestimated. Since "Blue Velvet" and "Wild at Heart" (1990), director David Lynch's work has become increasingly detached from the conventions of storytelling, with films like "Mulholland Drive" playing a cat and mouse game with audiences' expectations (the exception to this policy was, of course, "The Straight Story") and manipulating what we are seeing. It is perhaps one of the very few Lynch films that (almost) makes sense conventionally, and the result is a movie that brought the clammy terrors of this avant-garde film maker kicking and screaming into the mainstream. The term post modernism is used so loosely these days, David Lynch however secures the winning title of a post modern piece of film. A mixture of narcotic fuelled graphic sex and violence, drugs and alcohol abuse contrasted with the aesthetics of a 1940/1950's exterior. The stranger would think nothing of this little, picturesque town within America but look through the voyeuristic eyes of Jeffrey and you will be sucked into a world not even you could imagine. So horrifying you'll have difficulty believing your own eyes. This perfectly describes how you will probably react to this genuine masterpiece that caused a major sensation back in 1986 and is still doing so today. Surely, this is a testament to the films power and influence.<br/><br/>I'm pretty comfortable in saying that Blue Velvet stands as one of the most influential, greatest and original films of the 1980s. The cast is superb, the lush visuals are stunning, the score is exhilarating, and Dennis Hopper alone is brilliant (perhaps a little too brilliant...) as the deranged, mentally impaired psychopath Frank Booth. An electrifying film that I'd have no trouble recommending. I can see why many people consider Blue Velvet to be a masterpiece. Likewise, I can see why many dispute this status and dislike the film immensely. I am caught somewhere in between. The film is a beautiful, almost dreamlike quality, although it features extreme sexual violence and many scenes are misogynistic toward Isabella Rossellini. <br/><br/>The performances are amazing, however. Dennis Hopper was exceptional, the always good Kyle MacLachlan turned in a fine performance, and Isabella Rossellini was amazing. Unlike the performances, the film was a mixed bag.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was done very well. The cinematography is beautiful, and watching it on DVD is a splendid experience. Yet, the violence is definitely a put-off and comes off as being distasteful at times. Watch at your own risk. David Lynch's Blue Velvet can, and will be reinterpreted by critics and theorists for decades to come. Probably Lynch's most famous work, along with the Twin Peaks saga, Blue Velvet is a highly original film about the loss of innocence and the sexual awakening of a young man who discovers a sinister, sadistic society living in his humble, All-American hometown.<br/><br/>The movie's storyline is quite simple, and as a result of the films success, has spawned countless imitators in both literature and cinema. A dangerously inquisitive young man, Jeffrey Beaumont (Lynch's muse Kyle MacLachlen, remember him from Twin Peaks?) comes across a human ear buried in a field of overgrown grass. Thanks to advice of his girlfriend Sandy, who obtained her information on the ear from her policeman father, suspects a local lounge singer of association in a crime and hides in her apartment in an amateurish plot to spy on her. She discovers him, procures a large knife, and forces him to strip. She proceeds to fondle him, insisting that she not be looked at. A knock on the door interrupts them, and Jeffery is sent back to the closet. Enter Frank Booth. He inhales a gas (helium?, many fans continue to debate on what the drug actually was) from a portable tank on his belt and then brutally rapes and abuses her, to a certain degree mirroring the very act of violence she performed on Jeffery. Frank exits, and moments later Jeffery consoles her, and she whispers to him: "hit me" In this brief twenty minutes, sexual roles are deliberately confused, reinvented, and ultimately reversed.<br/><br/>Even some fifteen years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime, but none as memorable, or as well-known, as this. What makes Blue Velvet increasingly disturbing and such a memorable piece of cinema is how it builds on and subsequently deconstructs audience expectations and assumptions. The film's Americana setting and mood are introduced in an exposition lifted directly from older classic films (there are numerous references to "It's A Wonderful Life"). In result, the film is initially expected to follow a particular path. It slowly plunges into crime and our expectations are violated by images of disquieting violence and explicit sex, and suburban archetypes are paired with primal curiosity and perversion.<br/><br/>The film is set in Lumberton, a very American town. This does not represent a quaint, small town by similarity; it IS one. Lumberton is filled with characters that are completely typical. Presumably the cops eat doughnuts, and drink coffee and the quarterback dates the head cheerleader not out of coincidence but of intention. These characters function to punctuate the story, not to distinguish it. The famous individuality of Lynch's disturbing, highly original vision is established in the darker side of Lumberton, one that is made known through the eyes of Jeffery, our detached observer and questionable hero. Important plot points are not figuratively underlined by clear dialogue and dim-witted, loudmouthed crooks. The film's crime occurs incidentally, and the main characters discover it by second-hand.<br/><br/>In the center of the slowly fashioned web of crime is Frank. Dennis Hopper's mesmerizing performance as drug-fulled Frank Booth has been cited numerously as one of the most vile characters in cinema. His dialogue appropriately echoes his nature; he speaks, and acts, in brief, concentrated violent outbursts, whether he is driving or demanding one of his thugs to get him a Pabst Blue Ribbon  his beer of choice, especially of Jeffrey's Hieniken.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated by audiences. Likewise, it is not a film that is easily forgotten. Thus, the film is a timeless controversy, something that will evoke discussion throughout the ages, and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise. David Lynch is a director I am very fond of and have been for a fair number of years. Ever since the '70s (when his debut film Eraserhead was first released) Lynch has been churning out a least one standout achievement for every decade, something few directors can muster and one of the numerous reasons as to why I consider Lynch an auteur of the modern surrealist scene. Over the years the director has received continually mixed reviews, with renowned film critic Roger Ebert developing a frustrated distaste for the man's work, while other film critics have hailed many of his pictures as "modern masterpieces." In the '80s, Lynch wrote and directed Blue Velvet; he was at the prime of his career, after crafting the unexpected, Oscar-winning The Elephant Man and the big-budget flop, Dune. Six years after his Oscar-winner, Lynch found his mojo and released Blue Velvet, to mostly unanimous approval. <br/><br/>Explaining the general premise, themes and filming techniques used throughout Blue Velvet is reasonably tricky (sorry to sound informal, but it is). At least, in simple terms, Blue Velvet is a film set in the picket-fence town of Lumberton, North Carolina; a place where everything "seems" perfect, until one day the illusion is shattered when a young college student stumbles upon a severed ear (the "bodily hole" is a persistent metaphor). Sound peculiar? Well, it is relatively normal when compared to other Lynch films, and ranks among the "three accessible features" (a.k.a. The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and The Straight Story). Such a piece was crafted long before depictions of the inner struggles, nightmarish realities and dishonesty behind suburban life became a generic and clichéd premise, and so such an image has persistently influenced film-makers from all generations. The underlying perversions conveyed during the film is what makes it all the more intriguing, showing that the seemingly good-natured, yet dangerously inquisitive protagonist is lured by a battling sense of danger and sexual discovery.<br/><br/>Lynch was once quoted to have said "the home is a place where things go wrong"; this is a recurring theme which plagiarises a fair few of the director's projects. The constant battle of good vs. evil in modern socialisation is also commonly found, repeatedly displaying a clear winner, while keeping a lurking sense of the prevailing force in close proximity, but with the objector merely concealing itself. The dysfunctional lifestyle found in today's culture echoes through a heavy use of symbolisation and meticulously-weaved narrative. Our anxieties in life are hinted through our mannerisms; Jeffrey Beamount (the central character) is not simply out to solve his curiosities, but to awaken his sexual desires, as shown via his avoidance to become reluctant and the fulfilling of sexual instincts. Many individuals are oblivious to the troubles of life and choose to treat severed ears as normal, rather than a case for fearfulness. Is this an example of desensitisation, or a sheer longing to shy away from the bitter truth? Personally, I will opt for the latter interpretation, but with the additional idea that innocence and curiosity are two emotions that can be easily confused and preferably warped.<br/><br/>The infamous opening, whereby Jeffrey's father is seen collapsing from a seizure on a clear summer's day, in the postcard-perfect environment speaks so much. I think Lynch pinpoints the naïve lives led by those who exist in close-knitted, all-too-perfect communities, saying how danger is always present and volatile. Accusations of Blue Velvet being misogynistic can be endlessly discussed and all I can say for the matter is that Blue Velvet is allegory for domestic violence, particularly the violence women face in the supposed "safety net" of the home. Violence is everywhere and even if we are not apart of it, the threat is still ongoing, meaning that a true level of contentment cannot be reached. At least, this is what Lynch seems to boldly implicate. The dualities of the themes are open to discussion, but the opportunity to freely interpret is available to. Upon viewing please note the use of reversing roles, shown through the depiction of one character dominating the other when faced with varying situations of dilemma. <br/><br/>Told in a way that closely establishes a tone of film-noir, Blue Velvet uses the reoccurring features found in the genre, enabling the piece to become a neo-noir. Components include femme fatale and a case of mixed morals directed towards the viewer from the dubious outlook of the central protagonist. His deep-seated desires remain unspoken, but physically visible. This beautifully hypnotic, dangerously perverse and infuriatingly honest take on life will forever be foreseeable (like the foreshadowing shown through repeated imagery). Are we all in search of a distant and implausible normality? Many of us are, particularly when living in a blurred reality fuelled by its own false ideologies. If more truth be told, it is a strange world. Even though writer/director David Lynch probably never intended it, critics in 1986 saw in Blue Velvet a reference to Reagan-era politics: insidious and underhanded behavior covered up by a colorful and squeaky clean surface. Now Blue Velvet has been dusted off and restored just in time for the second act of the Bush era, and it still fits. And even though Blue Velvet can work on that political level alone, it goes much deeper. Its mysteries travel the four winds, and many of them will never be solved (just what is that toothy object hanging over Jeffrey's bed?). In any case, Lynch's fourth feature film was and still is a bona-fide masterpiece, one of the few such films that was actually appreciated in its time and has perfectly weathered the 17 years since.<br/><br/>The story has college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan, who was also in Lynch's Dune and Twin Peaks) coming home from school when his father suffers an attack. Wandering through a field on the way home from the hospital, Jeffrey finds a severed ear. He brings it to the local police detective (George Dickerson), whose pretty blonde daughter Sandy (Laura Dern) lets Jeffrey in on a few more sordid details. Apparently, a local singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) is mixed up in something sinister that may connect to the ear. Unable to control his curiosity, Jeffrey sneaks into her apartment and witnesses a disturbing scene involving possible kidnapping and blackmail by a psychopath named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>Jeffrey continues digging into the crime and basically finds himself deeper and deeper in the mire. He hits rock bottom when he runs into Frank in the flesh. Frank takes him on a scary odyssey into the night, which ends in a disturbing display of violence. But in the morning, Jeffrey is far more disturbed by the violence he found within himself.<br/><br/>In some ways Blue Velvet is denser and darker than Lynch's recent masterpiece Mulholland Drive. Even focusing only on its glistening surfaces and scary subsurfaces, the film delivers a rich pastiche. The idyllic "Lumberton" where the characters live is presented as a parody, with the local radio station giving the time "at the sound of the falling tree" and characters speaking to each other in awkward, carefully controlled dialogue. Is everyone happy here, or is this how "they" want us to be? By contrast, Frank's world seems so much more fun. Like Stanley Kubrick in A Clockwork Orange, Lynch makes the underworld look like a scream at first. He lures us into it willingly before he brings the hammer down. The movie's most quotable lines are all Frank's: "What kinda beer you like, kid? Heineken! F--- that s---! Pabst Blue Ribbon!!!" (Even that line reeks with a kind of Reagan/Bush Americanism -- either you're with us or you're a stinkin' Commie.) But at the film's end, when the evil has been defeated, what's left? Sandy's dream of Robins representing all the love in the world comes true, but in the form of a fake mechanical robin -- with a worm in its mouth.<br/><br/>Indeed, Lynch constantly toys with us. Almost every scene is ripe with some kind of hidden meaning. When Jeffrey first goes to Dorothy's apartment, the elevator is broken and Jeffrey has to climb several flights of stairs. Lynch includes a handful of other shots of characters climbing stairs as well. Usually this symbolizes either a descent into hell or a climb to heaven, but Lynch reverses these meanings. To what end? An emotional response, most likely, a way to make us feel even more off-balance than we would watching a traditional film noir.<br/><br/>That's ultimately Lynch's storytelling mode of choice: noir. He's interested in the dark places, the nightmares that make people squirm. It's in their squirming that people reveal themselves; they become truly alive. Which is why one of Frank's favorite things to say is: "now it's dark." Blue Velvet never came to my hometown movie theater in 1986, and so I discovered it on video and laserdisc -- and saw it at least a dozen times in that format. Seeing it for the first time on the big screen, though, I discovered new clues and new mysteries. And Blue Velvet is just as great now as it always was. This is David Lynch's masterpiece. The scenes dripped with style, yet that style never seemed distracting. None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the hooky pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young man who finds a severed ear in a field. He takes it to the police but his own thirst for knowledge and mystery leads him to take matters into his own hands. He decides to investigate and it leads him into the apartment of a depraved woman whose need to be loved and debased at the same time causes conflicts within him. He wants to help her escape her captor, who has kidnapped her husband and son, but she won't allow him to try. Soon he gets too involved, not only with her, but with his investigation and soon finds himself having to try to save himself.<br/><br/>With a Hitchcockian theme and Lynch's unabashed mastery of the weird and perverse, this is a wholly unique and quite entertaining flick from the bizarro world. Definitely not for all tastes, but for those who don't mind their tales thoroughly twisted, it's about as fun a journey as you could hope for. Hopper is phenomenal as is Rossellini, giving their all in probably the best roles of their careers. Lynch's direction meshes with his surprisingly adept screenplay with perfection, and some genuinely funny and genuinely disturbing moments fill the screen, and often at the same time. Bold, audacious, and beguiling. It's too bad Lynch spent most of the next few years trying to outweird himself. Great entertainment. A few years ago, a friend of mine recommended I see "Blue Velvet", having been a fan of David Lynch's "Twin Peaks" series. I had very little prior knowledge of both Lynch and Blue Velvet, yet I had herd of the title being thrown around from time to time. I finally got to see the film this year, and I'm very glad I had the opportunity. Similar to the Twin Peaks trilogy, the film examines small-town life in turmoil, and also features the charming and interesting Kyle MacLachlan. The film is a thriller of sorts, yet it could easily fit the category of a romance film, crime drama, or a mystery. Perhaps, even an erotic movie. When this came out theatres back in 1986 (it was 1987 here in Australia), it was quite evident to many that David Lynch had crafted something different, something highly original. I know it has gained quite the reputation for being notoriously sexual/violent.<br/><br/>But once you get beyond all that, there is a very intelligent, multi-layered film. See Blue Velvet if your after a completely different experience, and if you want to expand your knowledge on film or just have your mind challenged. Blue Velvet is very much an American movie. It is set in America, and the location of the setting is a very Americanised town, full of places and items that have come to represent all-things Americana. Diners, hamburgers, logs, beer etc. Yet, the story is very much a universal kind of a fable. Its a tale on the loss of innocence and the dark, perverse interior of everyone and everything. It's about peering through the facade of perfection, only finding the very opposite. When you watch Blue Velvet, you adapt to a bit of a perverted nature. After all, watching movies, especially ones like this, challenge you to take on that role. This is mimicked during the film, a character asks of her boyfriend "I don't know whether your a detective or a pervert." If you haven't seen this, I really suggest you go see it. Yes, its full of explicit sex and violence, yet the film carries a message and is far from being anything exploitive. The performances are wonderful, the score is excellent (although it can be a distraction at times), and the direction is amazing...while the film is, well, legendary and will last throughout the ages. Blue Velvet may very well be one of the most influential and distinctive films of the 1980s, mainly because when it was released, no-one (both critics and audiences) had seen something quite as horrifying. Since its release, Blue Velvet has come to symbolize an entire way of looking into small-town America; burrowing beneath its apparently wholesome surface to unearth corruption, scandal, perversity and torture. The most astonishing achievement of this repellent, yet unbelievably compulsive masterpiece is that it leaves the whole facade intact. At the end of the film, the birds are chirping, the sun is shining brightly through the healthy green trees, and everyone's together. This is because the horror's of the film have been witnessed throughout the film have magically been absorbed into everyday normality. What has changed, however, is us. The viewer. And probably the characters as well. Blue Velvet leaves us feeling altered, and forever changed. You don't really forgot the first time you see Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>It still stands as David Lynch's best film. Revealing what the film is actually about would be silly, because the film's quite a trip. It may not be a trip that everyone will want to take. It may be like what Sandy asks Jeffrey at one point: I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. But, the astonishing and intriguingly bizarre plot will probably be enough to lure you in and find out what exactly happens in the film.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is one original classic that is required viewing for your visual repertoire. It is a study on what lies beneath everyone, good or bad. After all, "It's a strange world, isn't it?" For many viewers, David Lynch is the movie equivalent of turning over a rock in search of obscene horrors that have never seen the light of day. It's also certain that for many another viewer his films are just twisted freak shows, good for a sick laugh. Savant tends to get serious with movies I find disturbing. The weird thing about Lynch is that, while somewhat glamorizing the vice and ugliness that inhabit his fantasies, he is clearly equally inspired by the 'sweet side' as well. There's a disillusion factor to Velvet, in that Jeffrey Beaumont's introduction to the perverse underworld is seen as necessary for him to both appreciate and understand the misleadingly 'normal' straight world.<br/><br/>The film is about Jeffrey, and his discovery of a human ear in his very clean and well-kept hometown of Lumberton. With the help of a friend, he investigates the mystery. Jeffrey sneaks into the apartment of sultry singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), and opens the lid of a horrible underworld of human evil. Soon he is shadowing the verminous Frank (Dennis Hopper). During this time, he bears witness to the horrible sexual violence that takes place beneath an American town. Eventually, Jeffrey falls into the clutches of the murderous Frank, and must pay for his curiosity with a harrowing ordeal.<br/><br/>Inside this seamy underworld, Blue Velvet presents a scary vision of human obscenity, centred mainly on the unstable, demented Frank, a villain whom actor Dennis Hopper claimed he was born to play. Spouting forth with frighteningly vicious profanities and rattlesnake violence, Frank is what we in the straight world call one sick puppy. Monsters roam the earth, Lynch says, committing horrible acts to indulge cruel desires. Frank represents that bad guy so terribly bad he's somehow impervious to the law ... the guy you don't want to meet up with, even in broad daylight.<br/><br/>The performances, the direction, the score, the visuals are all equally magnificent. Isabella Rossellini, daughter of 1930s and 40s screen goddess Ingrid Bergman (Casablanca), turns in an amazingly courageous performance as the battered, fragile sex slave Dorothy. While Dennis Hopper (Hoisers) plays a villain like no other. His performance is so well-crafted and extreme its almost laughable.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is extremely explicit. Yet, a good combination of style and substance keep it from becoming completely exploitive. Blue Velvet is a film not really for the light hearted, but I do recommend this crowd in watching the film to challenge the senses, just like our protagonist Jeffrey does so in Blue Velvet. 10/10, a great movie! Blue Velvet is a very subversive, confronting film about a 'normal' American town living in seeming complacent denial, while dark and malevolent forces seethe below the surface. At the centre of the film is Jeffrey, an amateur detective and a leading character who wants to 'know' about the reality below everyday normality, a desire which leads to traumatic disillusion. David Lynch's message seems to be that the sweet surface of life is a thin veneer that cannot totally cover a horrible underworld of vice and sickness. Blue Velvet is not the first film in depicting this (there was the Alfred Hitchcock film Shadow of a Doubt), although Blue Velvet was far more influential in spawning a number of films about this particular fable. It's probably the one that did it best.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a jolting experience. It is probably something that wouldn't be best shown with an 80-year-old, and has some pretty explicitly depicted moments. The film has deservedly turned into a modern-day "classic", and is often considered as David Lynch's best work, along with "Twin Peaks". If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things. It's a must-see. In the 80s classic Blue Velvet, David Lynch gave his probing, highly original gaze of the American underworld that would change the way we make films. Blue Velvet is surrealism art, in the highest and best form. The film centres a dark, sensuous murder mystery in a small, all-American town. At the centre of this mystery is Jeffrey Beaumont, who after exploring the crime himself, discovers that the murder is linked to two people, seductive night-club singer Dorothy Vallens, and sadistic psychopath Frank Booth.<br/><br/>The performances, especially from Dennis Hopper, are amazing. Kyle MacLachlan, of Desperate Housewives and Twin Peaks, captures his character's innocence and naivety perfectly. While Hopper creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentant, irredeemable evil.<br/><br/>The film's painful realism combined with hallucinary surrealism reminds us that we are not immune to the disturbing events which transpire in Blue Velvet's sleepy community, which can quite easily exit anywhere. There is a darker side of life waiting for us all, and Blue Velvet is here to remind us that. Now this is a weird movie! Well, it's from David Lynch, so it's not too surprising. "Blue Velvet" is set in Lumberton, USA, a small-town where everything seems bright and happy. We meet Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLaghlan), a nice clean-cut college boy who goes back home after his father has a stroke. Tough break, but Jeff ain't seen nothing yet. One day, he's walking in a field and he finds a severed ear. He brings to a police detective, but he also decides to investigate on his own. That's how he gets caught between Dorothy Valiens (Isabella Rosselini), a sensual night-club singer, and Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), a sadistic psychopath. Booth kidnapped Valiens' husband and son, and now he's forcing her to be his sexual slave. Beaumont, both intrigued and horrified by all this, finds himself getting involved sexually with the singer and wanting to help her. Yet he's also dating Sandy (Laura Dern), the detective's daughter, and even more dangerously, Frank doesn't look like he wants anyone getting in the way of his kinky games...<br/><br/>Watching "Blue Velvet" some fifteen years after its release is still a harrowing experience. It feels as "out there" as ever, and there hasn't been any movie since quite comparing to it, besides David Lynch' further adventures into screwing with your mind, naturally. But what remains so special about "Blue Velvet", as opposed to Lynch's overrated "Mulholland Drive", is that beyond the oddities, there's a straight-forward narrative, seemingly by-the-numbers mystery to follow. When it sticks to Lumberton's simple suburban life, with neat and naïve Sandy and Jeff holding hands and playing detective, you can't help but think that you're watching a "normal" movie. The twist is in how these two bright-eyed innocents are pulled into an almost surreal underworld of drugs, violence and deviant sex. Sandy, apple pie catholic girl from head to toes, is utterly appalled, but Jeffrey... Well Jeffrey is attracted by this dark side. He loves his blonde schoolmate (or thinks he does), but when he's with Dorothy it's a whole other ballpark. It feels dirty with her, erotic... Dangerous. The film seems to be about this struggle between puritan decency and perverted impulses, as a boy is divided between the virgin he loves and the "whore" he desires.<br/><br/>Next to Jeffrey, who barely dares to let go of his inhibitions, we have Frank, his mirror opposite. Frank's the guy who's completely detached himself from morals and civilised behaviour. Frank is Man at his worst, devoid of heart and soul and governed solely by rage and lust. Every other word out of his mouth is "*&^$!", which he repeats constantly as if it was a mantra. "I'll $%#! anything that moves!" Then again, even he is not devoid of guilt, as he'll do any sick thing, but he doesn't want people looking at him! Hopper is riveting in this gleefully disturbing part, but I feel it wouldn't quite work as well if Rosselini couldn't hold her own opposite him. The tricky, subversive thing about her character is that while she's technically the victim, you can see that part of her really gets off on it. There's an incredible nakedness to her performance, a sense that unlike Jeff, her Dorothy has reached a point where she just lets go and abandons herself to her impulses.<br/><br/>What does it all mean? That's beside the point, but not in the sense that Lynch is being weird just for the sake of it. "Blue Velvet" is thematically rich and open to different interpretations, but it also works if you take it as a thriller. There's a story being told here, with a beginning, a middle and an end. Scenes and characters serve a purpose, and it pays off. Of course, it could still be seen as a dream or a nightmare or whatnot, but that's speculation. What I'm trying to get at is that the movie works in involving you and taking you on a journey and, though you might feel confused, you won't feel cheated. In short, this does right what "Mulholland Drive" did wrong. And then there's the constant to Lynch's oeuvre, his unique grasp of film-making and style. From the brilliant opening sequence, which illustrates the dark-side-of-suburbia premise perfectly, to the ambiguous conclusion, which may or may not be earnest in its embracing of love as a remedy to one's hidden destructive tendencies, "Blue Velvet" is wonderfully crafted. And what to say of the delightful use of music, be it Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score or the jolly 50s pop tunes which provide an ironic counterpoint to the harshness of what's on screen. "A candy colored clown they called the Sandman" Sheesh! What bizarre images Roy Orbison's "In dreams" now brings to mind! In closing, I have to quote Roger Davidson's answer to those who criticise the movie for what it is: "Of course it's sick - It's supposed to be sick !" Jeffrey (MacLachlan) is the contemporary knight in slightly tarnished armor, a shy and adolescent inhabitant of Lumberton, USA. After discovering a severed ear in an overgrown backlot, he embarks upon an investigation that leads him into a hellish netherworld, where he observes - and comes to participate in - a terrifying sado-masochistic relationship between damsel-in-distress Dorothy (Rossellini) and mad mobster Frank Booth (Hopper).<br/><br/>Grafting on to this story his own idiosyncratic preoccupations, Lynch creates a visually stunning, convincingly coherent portrait of a nightmarish sub-stratum to conventional, respectable society. The seamless blending of beauty and horror is remarkable - although many will be profoundly disturbed by Lynch's vision on the underworld of America, centered as it is on Dorothy's psychopathic hunger for violence - the terror very real, and the sheer wealth of imagination virtually unequaled in cinema. The only film that comes to mind to match the terror and masterfulness in equal measure would by "Psycho". **SPOILERS** The movie "Blue Velvet" reached cult status soon after it's release in September 1986 with people both loving the film to death or ranking it among the worst major, excluding low budget gems like "Plan Nine from Outer Space", motion pictures ever made.<br/><br/>The film does in fact have a number of holes in it's storyline that you can drive an 18 wheeler rig through with room to spear. There's nothing in the movie that connects or explain, much less solves,the central or core plot involving a missing human ear and who it belongs to. Were told by the young man Jeffery Beaumont, Kyle MacLachlan,that found the ear that it's possibly the ear of singer Dorothy Vallens, Isabella Rossellini, husband. Were also given to understand that he and Dorothy's young son are being held hostage by this whacked out psycho gangster Frank Booth, Dennis Hooper.<br/><br/>This scenario about Dorothy's young son and her husband goes on for more then half the movie where it's then almost entirely forgotten by everyone in the film, including Dorothy, until the very last scene! It's after were introduced to the leading characters that the film gets down to business involving some drug deal that went sour with Booth and his crooked cop friend Gordon or the Yellow Man, Fred Pickler,using the town of Lumberton police to rip off the local drug dealers. Yellow Man himself is then found murdered, somehow being able to stand up on his feet with his brains blown out, by a startled Jeffery in Dorothy's apartment together with another man who's left ear is missing, is that Dorothy's husband? It's never make clear in the film.<br/><br/>Eariler we see Jeffery get involved with the "missing ear" case when he's informed by Sandy Williams, Laura Dern, that her dad the towns chief of detectives Det. John Williams (George Dickerson), who told Jeffery to keep his nose out of the case, that the ear has something to do with singer Dorothy Vallens.<br/><br/>Jefffery immediately plays Junior detective by using Sandy as a look out as he then breaks into Dorothy's apartment in his attempt to solve the case of the missing ear. Getting caught hiding in the closet by Dorothy the unbelievably wimpy Jeffery lets Dorothy have her way with him forcing Jeffery to undress, while holding a kitchen knife to his face, and then having him preform sadomasochistic sex on her. All this gets even weirder when Booth suddenly shows up, with Jeffery again hiding in the closet, who then really works Dorothy over with his own strange and unique brand of wild and no holds bar kinky sex. Booth works himself up into a lather by both raping and beating as well as humiliating Dorothy as he sticks, what looks like, an oxygen mask on his face to keep himself from passing out.<br/><br/>The film has a number of scenes in it that make absolutely no sense at all with one having Jeffery being kidnapped by Booth and his hoods for daring to have anything to do with his squeeze Dorothy. Smearing his mouth with an entire lipstick stick Booth kisses and wipes his face on Jeffery's and then has him beaten almost to a pulp? There's also Sandy who at first doesn't want to be romantically involved with Jeffery, she has a study boyfriend already, but then goes bananas when she finds out that he's having a hot and heavy affair with Dorothy!<br/><br/>Jeffery himself comes across so completely clueless in what's going on in the film and his actions are so bizarre that you wonder if he isn't on the stuff, hard drugs,that Booth is involved with himself. The movie ends like it started with the little town of Lumberton coming across as your average, maybe more then average, middle American community where the things that it just experienced are as far away from it as the planet Pluto. <br/><br/>Jeffery who had survived the whole mess is now back to normal with his new girlfriend Sandy, not the sexy and hot to trot Dorothy, trying to forget what he just went through in the film. As for Dorothy she's also back to normal, with Frank Booth & Co. out of her life. And yes she's also united with her young son, wearing his favorite propeller beanie, whom she was trying to find, whom Booth held hostage, all throughout the movie. Blue Velvet catapulted David Lynch to mainstream success, before the craze of Twin Peaks and the notorious lesbian sex scene in his Mulholland Dr. The film was initially targeted with controversy, but is widely considered a classic by many today. For the majority of people, you think Lynch is either crazy or a genius. I am with the later, he captures a side of American that is clearly there, and does it so amazingly. The viewer is lured into this dream world, and then all of a sudden things shift gears and we feel were in someone's worst nightmares. This best describes Blue Velvet, which had me gob smacked when I first watched it back in the 1990s. Although I was initially inclined to agree with Roger Ebert's infamous dismissal of "Blue Velvet" as a shocking albeit skillful montage of pointlessly pretentiously violent and sexualized images and effects, I've had to do a 360 turnaround after seeing it again on DVD and reconsidering it in relation to some similar texts. The film certainly makes sense in comparison with a quest narrative such as Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" and in light of Sigmund Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self. It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably "Rear Window" and "Psycho," in its preoccupation with spectator psychology. It is so great, I would even go as far as comparing it with the two films.<br/><br/>The most important part occurs early in the film when the protagonist, Kyle MacLachlan, tells his girlfriend and accomplice on his adventures, Laura Dern that he needs to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Isabella Rossellini's character because "knowledge requires risk" but with the possible reward that "you might learn something." By the end of the narrative, MacLachlan's character should have learned a lot, but here's where Lynch flinches, much like Robert Altman in the conclusion to "The Player." MacLachlan emerges neither a sadder nor wiser man from his rite of passage and his descent into the dark corners of the psyche. Instead, Lynch cynically reprises the film's innocent opening with its hopelessly artificial, postcard pastoral idyl of American suburbia that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer. At the same time, he preserves the tenuousness of such a naive vision with the shot of an insect impaled on a robin's beak and with a soundtrack that subjects the theme song to a disturbing treatment out of some internal, subterranean sound studiowe are not presented with an optimistically beautiful ending, but an extremely dark and foreboding one disguised as a haven for safety and happiness.<br/><br/>When you finish watching it, you really know you've seen something. I needed to watch it twice to fully grasp what I was watching. Blue Velvet finds its director at his most provocative and daring. Rape, torture, sadistic sex, extreme violence and nightmarish images are all key to the film's plot. Some have knocked it for its lack of depth and meaningfulness. Well, don't get me started on that. If they know depth or meaningfulness, they must be looking for it in a film like Titanic. There is depth to Blue Velvet, and at an exhaustible amount. The ear at the start represents the events to take place in the plot, the recurring Blue Velvet motif, soon after his discovery of the ear, MacLaclan will discover the love substitutes embodied by both Rossellini and Dennis Hopper--the sadism and masochism, fetishism and scopophilia that, like it or not, are present in every son and daughter who has inherited from birth and learned from upbringing the pleasure/pain principle that underlies even the most well-intentioned, "selfless" love (the absence of any shown feelings between MacLaclan and either parent is another tip-off to the basis of his attraction to the dominitrix/sex slave character played by Rossellini).<br/><br/>While this film is solely an American slice of life, it can be enjoyed universally. It represents the darkness and the daring adventurous voyeur that drives all of us. Though Lynch has stumbled with later films (Wild at Heart, Lost Highway), Blue Velvet makes up for them all. Blue Velvet is, quite simply, one of the greatest, most inventive films ever made. I first herd about it in the papers in 1986, and saw it in the early 1990s at the height of Twin Peaks, also directed by David Lynch. I only rediscovered it this year when I bought myself a copy of the Total Film's public voting of the 100 best movies ever made. It is not a conventional film in any sense, and switches in and out of reality quite frequently. This makes it difficult to label. Post modern noir, surrealist nightmare, Freudian-type film. Or perhaps even coming-of-age sexual drama? Its also very funny in parks too. I do not know of a film that has made me life my ass off and chilled me to the bone in equal measure.<br/><br/>We know David Lynch today, because we know Blue Velvet. He wouldn't have been David Lynch without this, or Twin Peaks. He still would maintain his artistic style, but not many would be familiar with his name, or the term 'Lychian'. This was the film that ordained him as the cinema czar of the unconscious. Yoking his inky thematic obsessions to fresh storytelling rigueur, it struck a bomb under mainstream culture, the effects of which we are still feeling today.<br/><br/>Nothing quite prepares you for Blue Velvet. Not even the Norman Rockwell style opening, nothing can prepare us for one of the most disturbing, nightmarish films ever made. Blue Velvet's scariest scene comes half way through. When a young and curious man spies through a woman's closet and watches her undress. Then another man enters the room and brutalizes her beyond belief. That is when the viewer realizes they're not watching a normal movie. This is so original, it still hasn't been matched. Films study its thrills, but not its clever thinking.<br/><br/>It is a seemingly simple film, but if you look at the film twice, you realize that this is much layered. Lynch has placed symbolism and metaphors everywhere. Having said that, you really need to watch this film twice, it is a movie that gets better on numerous viewings. Some masterpieces are fantastic the first time, but are thin and lack depth on the second viewing. Blue Velvet becomes a new film every single time. This even puts Mulholland Drive to shame, Eraserhead comes close, but I don't think either can top Blue Velvet. Let's all be honest here. David Lynch's films are all cult films. A cult film, or cult classic, being something like Brazil, Rocky Horror, Blue Velvet, Night of the Living Dead, Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange and Pink Floyd's The Wall. Mulholland is a hugely regarded exampleI didn't like it. It was a complicated, self-indulgent mess and seemed David had pieced together random ideas after dropping acid. Blue Velvet is in the league of his hugely regarded group of films  a lot of people are familiar with the title, perhaps also having seen it. I had heard nothing but acclaim, and had been advised by a few movie-goers to see it. And now I've seen it, I am still in awe. So much so, I want to go back and bear Mulholland to see if is actually worthy of my timemaybe even the dreadful Lost Highway.<br/><br/>Granted, Blue Velvet is very bizarre. Yet, it is not totally bizarre that the viewer has no idea what is going on and has to go consult message boards and websites to crack the plot (if there even was one in the first place) like Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway. And it still has depth.<br/><br/>David Lynch, maybe you're not a loony, but an artist actually capable of extraordinary work of art. Blue Velvet is the best you have to offer. This is truly deserving of its status as a classic. In my very short 18 years, this is the best movie I've ever seen. David Lynch's depiction of a façade of idealized Americana and the secrets that lay under it was depicted so authoritatively it has become a cliché in cinema. It has even inspired Lynch himself, perhaps if there was no Blue Velvet, there would be no hit television series Twin Peaks which inspired many viewers to go back to the film, presumably who BV became such a cult. Take a look at American Beauty, which places family dysfunction in the middle of a beautiful suburbia, or Happiness which takes taboo sex and puts it into an extremely common society. These films have all, quite clearly, taken inspiration from Lynch's voyeuristic masterpiece. Years ago, people wouldn't dare rank this film as being a masterpiece  something similar to Psycho in 1960; it just wouldn't survive the controversy. Today, it is seen as one of the greatest examples of American cinema. Also, like Psycho. As time goes on, the film's content wares and it no-longer becomes as frightening or taboo as it was twenty-one years ago, but more and more regarded.<br/><br/>There are stellar performances from every one of the genius cast-members. Pre-Desperate Housewives, Twin Peaks Kyle MacLachlan (in a role that took him to the spotlight), who is forced to play voyeur after his town's underworld is discovered, is mesmerizing as the innocent college man who likes mystery-turned pervert. Isabella Rossellini captures the depressed, emotionally ruined and almost self-destructible night-club singer machocist. Laura Dern conveys innocence perfectly as Sandy  but the clear stand out performance is Dennis Hopper as one of the most frightening gangsters ever captured on celluloid. He matches the psychosis of Norman Bates o Hannibal Lector. What's got me questioning, where was the Oscar? The content of the film probably limited its chances, similar to Psycho, it proved to controversial. But today, it would probably sweep the Oscars.<br/><br/>Lynch satirizes small town American and cleverly engrosses the viewer into a place we dare not to go (outside the comfort of our living rooms). Cast off any preconception that this movie isn't good, it's a masterpiece, see it! The mesmerizing affect it had on me is most likely to be put upon you. When Blue Velvet was released in cinemas in 1986, it was like a "movie earthquake", causing just as much a stir as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho did, almost twenty six years before. I'm sure directors throughout the film world felt the earth move beneath their feet and couldn't sleep the night of their first encounter with it back in 1986, and screens trembled again and again with diminishing aftershocks over the next decade as these picture makers attempted to mount their own exhilarating psychic cataclysms. <br/><br/>But twenty-one years later, no one can still perfectly match the traumatizing combination of horrific, comedic, nourish, aural, and subliminal effects Lynch rumbled out in this masterpiece -- not even Lynch himself in the fun-filled years that followed before he recombined with himself to invent Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire, his two latest films. The performances are amazing, but the stand-out is clearly Hopper. Who creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentant, irredeemable evil. Rossellini also dazzles the screen, in the same manner her mother did, but in an entirely different way. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern represent pure innocence, and match it perfectly.<br/><br/>Even after all these years, nothing has tarnished about Blue Velvet. Nothing. Despite the countless imitators that try to probe disturbing small-town life, but fail miserably, Blue Velvet' still holds up perfectly. And how many films can you say that for? A naive college student returns from hospital visiting his father only to discover a human ear in a grass filed. After he becomes unsatisfied with the police's pace of the investigation, he becomes intrigued by the case and begins to investigate. While investigating, our heroic Jeffery is led into a lurid murder mystery were he learns that a nightclub singer is being held captive by a sadistic rapist.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a thriller that, quite clearly, Hitchcock would be proud of. It combines surrealism someone as great as Buñuel would be capable of. It is perhaps, along with classics like Psycho, Vertigo or Rear Window one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema. Myself, not particularly fond of the genre, was heavily engrossed in this. And it takes a good thriller to entice someone (like me) not even a fan of the genre. David Lynch has created a rich and atmospheric, film-noir world to challenge and ultimately subvert various different notions of innocence, sexuality, and love. Even the casting reflects the director's cleverly conducted agenda: Lynch's fresh young, seemingly innocent heroes, as played by Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern, are like leads in a 1950s hygiene film; he pits them against two icons of a lost Hollywood, Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper, the latter turning in a jolting, career-resuscitating performance.<br/><br/>Its impact on cinema has been extremely seminal. It has achieved a mood and tone which would indelibly influence popular culture for even today (the Blue Velvet touch can be seen in films like American Beauty, Disturbia). It's not a totally infallible film (but then again, neither is The Godfather, Jaws or Citizen Kane)but overall, makes a solid impact and demands attention. For many viewers, David Lynch (Mulholland Dr., The Elephant Man, Eraserhead) is the movie equivalent of turning over a rock in search of obscene horrors that have never seen the light of day. It's also certain that for many another viewers his films are just bizarre freak shows, good for a sick laugh. Savant tends to get serious with movies I find disturbing. The weird thing about Lynch is that, while somewhat glamorizing the vice and ugliness that inhabit his fantasies, he is clearly equally inspired by the 'sweet side' as well. There's a disillusion factor to Velvet, in that Jeffrey Beaumont's introduction to the perverse underworld is seen as necessary for him to both appreciate and understand the misleadingly 'normal' straight world. The film centers a college student whose life comes to an abrupt halt when Jeffery Beamount (Kyle MacLachlan) unwillingly welcomes the opening of a twisted, voyeuristic underworld and the people that reside in it. Including the sultry lounge singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who is being tortured sexually by the verminous Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). The extremes of vice and cruelty he witnesses from afar become an addiction - and he gets himself personally involved with the traumatically disturbed Dorothy. Then Jeffrey falls into the clutches of the murderous Frank, and must pay for his curiosity with a harrowing ordeal<br/><br/>Like very few other films of its kind, style alone that Lynch keeps Blue Velvet from becoming pointlessly exploitative rubbish and turns it into a deep, jolting experience. Rossellini's stunning performance as the tortured, suicidal sex slave Dorothy is truly remarkable, and almost matches the flawless ability of her late mother, Ingrid Bergam. Her crumbling mental state and sexual confusion elicit contradictory feelings: her 'affair' with Jeffrey is a fearful mix of desperation, rage, and erotic hope. <br/><br/>In order to watch Blue Velvet, you really need to be an adventurous viewer. Voyeurism, rape, extreme outbursts of sexual violence, inappropriate language, and disturbingly surreal images are all apart of the film. Aside from that, Blue Velvet inhabits a truly artistic attitude worthy of the works of Salvador Dali or Picasso. And you'll know that's an amazing feat. In the brilliant opening scene of David Lynch's nightmarish journey in the dark side of America, we see images that exemplify idealized small town life where there seems to be no trouble whatsoever, everything seems so simple. Yet, despite all that, something also seems to be not so right, something unjustifiable, very eerie. Keep in mind; this is a David Lynch film. And then, everything turns a man drops to the ground from what it looks like a stroke and the camera reveals a nest of bugs under a perfectly trimmed grass surface.<br/><br/>Then a young man finds a human ear lying amongst an overgrown grass field. He becomes intrigued and takes it the police. After unsatisfactory help from the police, Jeffery, assisted by the virginal all-American girl Sandy, decide to investigate the case together. The two receive a lead to a mysterious, seductive nightclub singer, Dorothy Vallens, who lives in an apartment down a few streets. As they investigate further, the two are driven into a voyeuristic underworld home to serial rapist and gangster Frank Booth. After this, pretty much know one in Lumberton is safe from the evil Jeffery has just uncovered.<br/><br/>First of all, let me rejoice in saying Blue Velvet is one of the greatest films I have seen in many years, it is certainly the definitive, possibly the most seminally influential films of the 1980s, along with E.T. But it's a very different kind of greatness, it contains raw emotional energy it attacks you like an electric jolt. It contains a compendium of styles and genres making it one of the most original films in years. with elements drawn from teenage mysteries, porn films, coming-of-age movies, Caprastyle family comedies, films noir, Hitchcockian psychosexual thrillers, horror movies, all combining with the elusive rightness of a bad dream. There is nothing calculated or intellectualized about Lynch's approach. We simply feel, in every frame, how deeply pop culture imagery has penetrated his imagination, see the dark colours it has added to his nightmares. This alone makes Blue Velvet worthy of re-watching for years to come. But remember, you need to be in an appreciative mind-frame and open to films as dark and as challenging as this. So if this fits your preference, I urge you to see Blue Velvet, for an utterly life-changing experience, a cinematic masterpiece that you rarely ever see, and perhaps see again. Blue Velvet was released to an America that was largely unfamiliar with Lynch's work, and a country that wasn't equipped enough for a film as dark as this. Its release changed the way we would watch films and became the hallmark body of all of his work.<br/><br/>The film opens with the opening credits superimposed over, appropriately, a beautiful piece of blue velvet hanging and swaying with the breeze. Angelo Badlamenti's (who contributed to many of Lynch's films following this) music sting is melodramatic and ominous. Then a series of impossibly beautiful shots of the small town of Lumbertown, North Carolina. Where almost everything seems to be a make-believe fantasy world likely fashioned after Lynch's hometown of Missoula Montana. It's a template for the "Twin Peaks" world, a glossy middle-America world of good coffee and apple pie but with a dark underbelly seething underneath. This is a common subject for Lynch. Similarly his Los Angeles, or Hollywood of "Mullholland Drive" was ripped apart in the third act to reveal a murderous, seemingly endless world of jealousy and greed.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont is our guide into this world, a young college graduate who after visiting his sick father in hospital stumbles upon a human ear lying in the grass, swarming with bugs. Jeffrey does the right thing and informs the police. But, like most young men, Jeffery grows more and more curious about the mystery, and so begins his own Hardy Boys-type exploration into the crime. After following a few clues he finds himself hiding in the closet of the sultry Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) a lounge singer and sex slave for the vile, foul-mouthed gangster Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Jeffrey is found out, but instead develops a relationship with Vallens. When Booth finds Jeffrey out, all hell breaks loose and the innocence that seemed so evident in Lumberton is now gone.<br/><br/>Firstly, not everyone is going to like a film like this. It is full of extreme sexual violence, and strong language that makes it a petrifying, unnerving experience. But you have to appreciate its genius. I've always said, at will David Lynch could make the scariest film of all time. He uses all elements at his disposal, sound, music, lighting, camera angles, and movement first to create a foundation of utter creepiness, then he can make you jump with slightest of changes. For example, Laura Dern's luminous introduction at night on the sidewalk outside her house. From the darkness she slowly emerges from under a street-lamp to introduce herself to Jeffrey. It's a subtle but brilliant cinematic moment. And only Lynch could make Roy Orbison or Bobby Vinton scary. That's talent.<br/><br/>The dichotomy of the mid-western saccharine life with the heinous villainy of the seedy underbelly is what Lynch has recycled ever since this film. Don't miss it. David Lynch's glossy, artistic, erotic, voyeuristic, relentless and terrifying crime noir thriller delves into the darkest realms of the human psyche. It is one of the greatest, most significant examples of an art-house movie that really made an impact on mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet's plot is relatively simple on the surface, yet richly complex underneath, intertwining conventions and genres as diverse as thriller and horror, sex and drama, comedy and noir. It centers, or begins, with the discovery of a human ear in a field. For Jeffrey (MacLachlan) the ear becomes a key to the bizarre, dark world that lurks beneath the absurdly ordinary small-town America evoked in the breathtakingly choreographed opening sequence that alludes the fact that something may be festering beneath the seemingly perfect surface. With some help from Dern as the daughter of a local cop, Jeffrey finds himself drawn into the life of nightclub singer Dorothy (Rossellini) and her psycho, drug-dealing, ether-sniffing lover Frank (Hopper).<br/><br/>The film, which incidentally relaunched Hopper's career (who was suffering somewhat of a bad reputation at the time), came at a time when the idea of a grim reality lurking beneath the conventional white picket fence exterior film was a relative, seldom novelty. The fact that it has become commonplace, that the appearance of a white picket fence is now a pointer for a switched-on audience that the film is going to be an attack on the hypocrisy and complacency of Middle-America, is simply further testimony to Blue Velvet's impact - or more accurately assault - on its audience.<br/><br/>This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism yet surrealistic quality conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban nightmare, a black comedy, seeing things that you don't usually notice through the naked eye, a jolting-shock of realization, and a cathartic sense of hope. All the elements and ensemble efforts in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. 10/10. A lot has happened since David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" first send shockwaves through the world of movies in 1986 and provided thrills and gasps in audiences in the same way that the shower scene in Psycho did for audiences back in 1960. We have since seen "Pulp Fiction," "Natural Born Killers," and Lynch's own subsequent freak-feasts "Twin Peaks," "Wild at Heart," "Lost Highway," down to "Mulholland Drive." and even "Inland Empire". I may be excused, then, for expecting the original to have somewhat less of an impact than it had 16 years ago. But repeated viewing of this well-produced DVD makes it clear that nothing could be further from the truth -- the cut-off ears, the haunting title song, the haunting show-tunes, dancing midget prostitutes and strange obsession with logs has not diminished in the least, its haunting and profoundly disturbing quality as not tarnished. Clearly, it's still a strange world, even if some of Lynch's tricks have become predictable.<br/><br/>As the couple drawn into a hellish, kind of soap-opera like noir mystery, Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are young, naive and wonderfully innocent foils for Isabella Rossellini's mix of knife-brandishing mania, robe-wearing and naked vulnerability, and Dennis Hopper brings a hailstorm of curse-words to his best, most well-known performance. "Blue Velvet" is still a hallucinatory experience, and it is still more satisfying than some of Lynch's less shapely films. The seamy underbelly of Lumberton, U.S.A. is still a fascinating place to visit, whether you are returning after many years or looking for a place to start exploring the twisted universe of David Lynch. Blue Velvet is undoubtedly one of the best examples he has to offer, and one of the finest, most original works in American cinema. Last night I had the opportunity to watch Blue Velvet, after word-of-mouth. And wow, the result... such a strange, disturbing but amazingly told film. The plot is relatively simple, college boy finds severed ear and starts investigating where it might have come from... he enters into a bizarre sadistic world first as a voyeur, later as reluctant participant, and at times it's very difficult to watch. It's beautifully shot however... it has a real noir feel and Lynch's use of light and tight editing make it a very tense watch, but at the same time you cannot take your eyes of the screen.<br/><br/>The characterization is amazing. Frank, played to perfection by Dennis Hopper has to be one of the most disturbed characters I've ever seen in a film. He embodies everything a villain should. The way he inhales amyl nitrate through his mask, his extreme lust for sexual violence, the lipstick scene with Kyle MacLachlan... it felt very real and beyond weird. Isabella Rosellini is top-notch, playing fragile and mentally unstable very convincingly and her performance really affected me. It's a brutal film and at times incredibly tender. It won't appeal to everyone, you need to like a film that challenges and be prepared to view some disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, it is Lynch's magnum opus along with Mulholland Drive (2001), and contributes magnificently to his career oeuvre. If you can consume dark material, you need to see Blue Velvet. It is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen, and that is a very big feat for someone like me. Some times in 1993 I stumbled on some film magazine which featured the article about the best and most influential movies of 1980s, I was pleasantly surprised to have seen three of them (fatal attraction, brazil) and David Lynch's artistically bizarre, disturbing classic Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>At the time, Lynch was really only known for The Elephant Man, mainstream wise. Later on, after the flop DUNE, he got the chance to re-establish himself and make anew film. It was more than that - the chance was used by Lynch who made a suburban set, sort-of noirish thriller BLUE VELVET, a very personal film that proved not only the best in his opus but also one of the best, most influential movies in recent memory. <br/><br/>The film, unfortunately, didn't became popular initially - Lynch had to make his ground-breaking TV series TWIN PEAKS first; he became a household name, attractive enough for general audience, and thus brought attention on his earlier work, most having run towards BLUE VELVET. And home video, having released copy after copy of the film because of TWIN PEAKS mega success, assured the film a firm grasp of movie-goers around the world. BLUE VELVET slowly became so influential; countless films have been made based on, or around its concept. Surprisingly, its still shocking after all the inferior imitations. <br/><br/>It isn't surprising that those who had enjoyed TWIN PEAKS have the same feelings about BLUE VELVET. The movie and the TV series have a lot in common, but most noticeable of common elements is a subject - small all-American town that hides some sinister secrets in an underworld know one really knew of. The plot of the movie begins in Lumberton, small town inhabited almost exclusively by middle to upper-class people who live in suburban idyll, and all appear to be sublimely happy. One of those people is Mr. Beaumont who suffers stroke in the brilliantly filmed opening, and his young son Jeffrey must visit him in hospital. While returning from one of such visits, he finds a severed human ear in a field. He picks it up and brings it to Detective Williams, his close neighbour. Detective is very grateful for that find, but, being the by-the-book policeman, declines to satisfy Jeffrey's growing curiosity by providing information about investigation. Sandy, Detective's young and attractive daughter, seems to be more helpful by giving some hints to Jeffrey. Those hints mostly concern Dorothy Vallens, beautiful and mysterious bar singer who lives on the wrong side of tracks. Armed with that knowledge, Jeffrey decides to begin investigation of his own and devises daring plan to sneak into singer's apartment and observe what he can find. However, that plan backfires, because Dorothy discovers Jeffrey hiding in her closet and takes him at knife-point and forces him to strip down to his bare-but. Scared, embarrassed but also strangely aroused, Jeffrey is suddenly forced to hide again, because Dorothy gets another visitor. This leads him into a bizarre underworld, perhaps of no escape. One of the reasons why BLUE VELVET seems to be so appealing and popular to so many people - at least those who are way behind their teen years - is the fact that it takes some very universal subject - the loss of innocence and corruption of childhood. But such subject is here explored in a very personal story, with a lot of autobiographical elements. Even the title seems to be very symbolic - borrowed from a song by Bobby Vinton, that used to be huge hit in 1963. That very year symbolised the loss of innocence for entire generation, especially Americans who had to experience the trauma of JFK assassination. <br/><br/>Despite those sharp contrasts, BLUE VELVET has characters who defy single- dimensional moral alignment. Jeffrey Beaumont, author's alter ego is played by Kyle MacLachlan, actor who made his character some kind of a prequel to his Agent Cooper personality in TWIN PEAKS. This young man wants to do the right thing, but at the same time he is curious, and that curiosity leads him not only to personal danger, but to the danger of losing his own moral compass. His motives might look noble from the outside, but from the inside they aren't so certain. Dorothy played by Isabella Rosselini in the best known role of her entire acting career, is a woman whose character is something more than a simple victim - she is violated in an almost unimaginable way. That is symbolized in one of the shots in the final part of movie, when her nude, bruised and battered body, that should have been attractive in any other context, actually becomes almost unbearable to watch. Dorothy's exact opposite is Sandy, young, clean and innocent all-American girl, whose role in this movie is to be the voice of reason and the only link to the "normal" world for Jeffrey. But, her own motives are also unclear - she too seem to be thrilled by their investigation, and Jeffrey would never entered into adventure without her interference. <br/><br/>Such, noir style great movie also requires a great villain. Dennis Hopper, veteran actor and director who became his great renaissance as character actor in mid 1980s, mostly due films like BLUE VELVET is ours. If there was an example of role tailor- made for certain actor, Frank Booth is one of them. Hopper played him with such intensity that he managed to outshine almost anything in his career. <br/><br/>BLUE VELVET was a more than good or very good film, it was an excellent film, a masterpiece. It hardly has any noticeable flaws; and the only detractor to some prudish audiences would be the very classily filmed violence and strong sex, BLUE VELVET still remains the movie that deserves to be adored and re-watched over and over again, same as masterpieces that actually reached the perfection. A stunner that will enchant and terrify for years to come. I fail to see how Blue Velvet did not sweep the 1987 Oscars. It easily deserved Best Picture, Best Director and all the categories in Best Performance and, if such award existed, one for pure originality.<br/><br/>Basically, Blue Velvet is the age-old fable of good vs. evil. It's the story of Jeffery Beaumont who discovers a human ear in a grass field, which leads him into an underworld which he initially, did not know, existed. His performance is wooden, but this is simply because he represents innocence and everything it means to be normal, while the villain represents pure evil. They are two extremes. But the performance by Isabella Rossellini is quite simply, remarkable. She manages to captures the full breadth of Dorothy's complex personality her vulnerability and degeneracy, her desperation and longing, her hatred of Frank and need for him. The role demands much of her that goes beyond the nudity. Finally, there's Dennis Hopper, who, in a lifetime of playing vicious creatures, has never essayed one as sinister and purely evil as Frank, one of the most horrific villains ever to grace the silver screen. There is nothing redeemable about this man. Hopper recognizes it and embraces it as only he can.<br/><br/>The film will wrap itself around you, and there will be certain aspects you won't be able to shake off when you have watched the film. It is justifiably one of the greatest movies ever made, highly recommended viewing. Name: Blue Velvet <br/><br/>Year: 1986 <br/><br/>Director: David Lynch <br/><br/>Cast: Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, Kyle MacLachlan.<br/><br/>Classification: R for strong on-screen and implied violence, sexually explicit and inappropriate dialogue, drug use.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was at the pinnacle of discussion back in 1986-87, and after widely acclaimed reviews and constant discussion; I decided to see the film myself. When I did, I was blown away by the numbing experience. My friend was mortified, but "as sick as he thought"; he desperately wanted to see it again. And so did I, I think that is what evoked such a wow factor that propelled Blue Velvet to mainstream success. What intrigues me most is that twenty five years later; Blue Velvet continues to garn considerable amounts debate, discussion and analysis with movie-goers like my thirty-year old self. It is perhaps one of the very few erotic/sexually charged films that is taken seriously, and has continued to cause controversy so many years since its initial release.<br/><br/>Before the release, Lynch had hardly taken any liberties like he did in this film. He was known as the director of the Elephant Man, a hugely successful biographical film which told the story of a man with a hideously deformed face, which gained immense acclaim globally. It was not Elephant Man that catapulted Lynch to such success, but Blue Velvet, which came six years later. Not everyone liked Blue Velvet, however, as critics and audiences challenged the film for its highly charged, inappropriate content. But those people are clearly living in some innocent fantasy where everything is normal and evil is basically non-existent. Blue Velvet takes the dark world and glorifies it on screen, which is what made it such a success in its later years.<br/><br/>If I could chose one film to recommend in my lifetime, it would be this. So I urge you to see the film and check whether it is capable of changing your life in the way it did mine. I'd also questioned why this isn't high up on the top 250, but take a good look at that list and you'll probably realize why.<br/><br/>* * * * * out of * * * * * Many people on IMDb seem to think of Blue Velvet as a masterpiece. I disagree with this. The good parts: The movie is decently acted, the music is very well done and some parts are very nicely shot.<br/><br/>But my main problem is with the plot. It may have been shocking and original back in 1986, but watching this movie in 2007 left me quite unaffected. Admittedly, the plot is somewhat multi-layered: Behind the obvious crime story there are themes like 'good vs evil', 'finding love', or 'discovering sexuality'. Even still I found the plot to be lacking any real substance or thrill. I will not go into specifics as to avoid spoilers, but the movie just didn't get me thinking or blow me away at all, like some other movies have.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is worth a watch, but I recommend watching some of Lynch' more intricate works, such as Mullholland Drive, Lost Highway and the TV-series Twin Peaks instead. In 1986, the movie industry was rocked when a film came along and blew everyone away, because of its high quanties of shocking sexually violent episodes, and its overall dark nightmaris tone. It was produced for just $6 million, yet made such a lasting impact.<br/><br/>Some would say Blue Velvet examines the underworld and how the surfaces of something dark and evil can be as innocent and normal, or the question and identity of what it means to be normal, or even a victim of being a normal person in today's unforgiving world. The norm for Lynch is corrupt and violent in its very foundations. The normal sharing of a beer is weighted with darkness. It is surface acceptance and underground violence of the other: the sexual, the beautiful, the foreign, the unknown and mysterious. All innocence is sacrificed for the normal for innocence always exists in passion the extreme the ecstatic. Frank Booth is the symbol of all that is sick in America-he deals drugs and thus manipulates addiction --addiction to love vs. an obsessive addiction to sex. Dorothy Vallens is not addicted to perverse sex as is Frank she's addicted to love but has been twisted psychologically into seeing perverse sex as her only way of getting love: thus "Hit Me". The trauma of being the victim of Frank or equally the victim of a master of addictions (Hollywood Americana ) has burned a perverse psychology into her and it can only be cured by getting back her child=innocence alive=hope.<br/><br/>The sick aspects of Blue Velvet are all very, very relevant. They show the distinction between the victimizer and the victim. This film is so easily misunderstood by the people that are frightened by the perverse and disturbing aspects is because people desire to live on the surface--truth takes strength--the strong, the loving and the damaged will implicitly love this film. Even our wacky, obsessively malevolent villain Frank Booth would love this film--that is the film's deepest message. Blue Velvet is David Lynch's nostalgic, dreamlike masterpiece, which every director will experience once in a while. It is a haunting, colorful, disturbing erotica that has evoked a major emotional response from both film analysts and viewers. A masterpiece that becomes there trademark film, Hitchcock has Vertigo and Psycho, Kubrick has A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Bergman has Persona and Scenes from a Marriage, Fellini has 8 ½ and La Dolce Vita, Ridley Scott has Alien and Gladiator. Lynch, of course, has Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr.<br/><br/>It stands as one of the greatest, most seminal pictures released in the 80s. Forget Raging Ball, 9 ½ Weeks, Aliens, Hannah and her Sisters, Gandhi and even E.T. the Extra Terrestrial -- Blue Velvet marks its place as the most distinctive film of the decade. It's a leading example of the thriller genre, a re-birth of the neo-noir genre, a suspenseful drama, a satire on small life, and an examination of small town life in the worst form. People who decide to lack it for being extremely shocking and explicit are pathetic and are living in a childish dream world where everything (or say they seem to believe ) is perfect, they need to face reality and come to terms with the fact that the world is not a pretty existence, despite its outer skin. Blue Velvet shows what hides beneath a truly undetectable surface.<br/><br/>The performances range from great to amazing. Rossellini managed to shake off her status as merely the daughter of cinema magic Ingrid Bergham, and earn her own iconic status with a dark allure of sensuality and twisted perversion. Dennis Hopper has hit full stride in what I consider to be his greatest performance, and perhaps the best cinema villain to grace the screens. Forget Darth Vader, Freddy Kruger or the Alien in Alien, Frank Booth puts them all to shame. Because he isn't some impractical force with powers that defy logic, he is a villain we encounter in an extremely bad situation. There a people like this in the world, and what is even sadder is, they are everywhere. He is compulsively insane, obsessed with textured fabrics. Frank's misfit cronies are also excellent, especially the feminine Dean Stockwell, who plays Ben.<br/><br/>I choose this to study in my film course at my university. Because it is an endlessly fascinating film and becomes a different viewing experience each time. Do your self a favor and see it, you won't be disappointed. It is also a great film to begin with if you're looking to enter Lynch's wonderfully rich labyrinth realm of the dreamy and bizarre.<br/><br/>And the best picture award goes to Blue Velvet. Or at least that's what I like to think. It embodies everything a film should embody to be great: art, moving images, bravo photography, direction, acting, humor, suspense, and an overall stunning and unforgettably tour-de-force experience. David Lynch's intriguingly theosophical and hauntingly dreamlike depiction of small-town America at its very worse has had an undisputed impact on global cinema. It has revolutionized cinema to displaying more graphic depictions of violence, voyeurism and sexual abuse in a manner of Peeping Tom or Psycho for the 60s and Pulp Fiction for the 90s. But is it really all that good? Hell yes.<br/><br/>We are given some of the most refreshing and awe inspiring techniques, symbolism, metaphors, and visuals in Blue Velvet; Lynch is one of the most revolutionary and original directors and stylists in the history of cinema. In the town of Lumberton, where all of Blue Velvet is set, innocence is assumed by just about everyone the lives there, and in the fabulously filmed opening scene (which I must have watched on its own about twelve times now) features roses and tulips against a white picket fence, with Bobby Vinton's "Blue Velvet" playing in the background. Then, out of nowhere, a man has a heart-attack and everything grows unsettling and tense. The camera then slowly zooms down under the perfectly manicured grass to show bugs swarming all over each other. All of that is a metaphor for the ugliness depicted in the later half of the film existing under Lumberton's shiny, peachy clean surface.<br/><br/>Lynch mixes Alfred Hitchcock sexual obsession and voyeur with 1950s and 1960s kitsch (plus a heavy dose of the uncanny humor and quality) in one of the greatest depictions of a fable of evil below the surface of picket-fence suburban normality, a subject re-used over and over again, but never bettered. The iconic status of Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper was sealed along the way. Rossellini is amazing for taking this high risk role, and I am disgusted to see that the Academy overlooked her simply because of the content displayed. I'm sure today their opinion would differ rapidly, but today, know one would have the courage to release a film like Blue Velvet, as it is only occasionally when a film featuring content like this can be considered a "masterpiece". It's a gem that hardly ever comes around. 'A masterpiece' is the best way to class David Lynch's psycho noir thriller Blue Velvet. The electrifying thriller as created a tense, disturbing noir atmosphere that has failed to be matched by precedent cinema. It has stunning performances, an unforgettably nostalgic soundtrack and features some of Lynch's finest direction.<br/><br/>The film probes beneath the idealistic, cheerful surface of an American town, only to discover corruption and sadomashicistic sex and violence, drug abuse and murder, all depicted in perverse and hauntingly realistic ways. The character at the center of this mess is Jeffery, who discovered the underworld after finding a severed human ear in a field. The police's disinterest in the case leads him to investigate matters himself, and as a result meets a range of complex, haunting characters, including the inhuman villain Frank Booth. Booth is one of the most terrifying villains of cinema in recent memory. As the film draws to its bravo conclusion; we learn that just about everyone is being controlled by Frank, and the only way to stop the underworlds existence is to off Frank.<br/><br/>I strongly urge you to see Blue Velvet, even if it doesn't match your taste. The film is virtually without any noticeable flaws and will have you scratching your head long after the credits roll along, there are seemingly endless questions. To fully digest what you've seen, watch it multiple times to better the experience. The rating here on IMDb is lost in translation. A 7.8 for a widely recognized classic for modern cinema, its not surprising since most of this generation of voters would probably consider Matrix a "masterpiece". I don't think I have ever seen an American studio movie so rich, so formally controlled, so imaginatively cast, wonderfully acted and so charge with its marketer's psycho-sexual energy since...well...maybe ever. Blue Velvet is Lynch's third feature length film since the 1980 commercial flop Dune; proceeded by his experimental art-house/cult circuit sensation, Eraserhead. It may even be his trademark film, and surely is his greatest. It even defies Mulholland Dr., perhaps 2001's biggest critical sensation, notorious for its lesbian love scene between Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring. Most of his films are accustomed to being abstract or heavily artistic, even the Elephant Man and Straight Story had there moments. Some of them have been hard for viewers to access, but Blue Velvet is easily accessible, but still showcases Lynch's power and potential to shock and enthrall viewers Blue Velvet centers Jeffery Beaumount, a young college student, living in the pleasure-dome Lumberton, which seems to have been taken out of a magazine glorifying American town-life. The kind off town that is pictured on the cover of an American post-card. A town no one would suspect has such a malicious, depraved and sadomasticistic underworld home to drugs, taboo sex and lurid violence. After discovering a human ear, the underworld becomes clear to Jeffery and he decides to pursue it at his own risk. He encounters two people: Dorothy Vallens, a disturbed night-club singer whose child and husband have both been kidnapped by the monotonous Frank Booth.<br/><br/>What makes Blue Velvet different or special from a typical Hollywood sex thriller? Its diverse quality and outlook on small-town life has revolutionized the way we see films. Forbidden sex in Blue Velvet does not take place in a slummy area of a sprawling metropolis or a sleazy hotel, but in a small town where innocence and happiness is always assumed. The blend of innocence, naïveté, and kinkiness arises from a startling juxtaposition, akin to surrealism that pervades Blue Velvet from being a typical crime thriller. The film not only pivots between extremes of setting and behavior, but successfully mixes intense human drama and offbeat humor. The art direction bears subtle references to the 1950s, and camp soap operas hailing from that very era. All of this weaves itself into Blue Velvet an astonishing rage of associations that enrich and basically transform the initially simple plot... all of this is apart of its magic.<br/><br/>What has become one of the most definitive films of the 80s (yes, it surpasses the decades most famous and well-received films such as Hannah and Her Sisters, Raging Bull, the Rocky films, Fatal Attraction, the Star Wars sequels, The Shining, Die Hard, sex, lies and videotape). The high rating here on IMDb (7.8) just isn't good enough. It needs to be taken to the top 250, and stay firmly there. Blue Velvet is an overall classic - especially worthy of a 10/10. Blue Velvet spawned a long line of suburban-set crime thrillers, but none has been quite as imposing as this masterpiece from the director of the macabre and outer-worldly cinema David Lynch. The film centres around Jeffrey Beaumont, a clean-cut young man temporarily back in Lumberton to help out as a result of his father's serious illness. He's a wholesome small-town guy in a wholesome small-town  until he happens upon a grotesque discovery that hurtles him into the midst of a decidedly unwholesome series of events, and a spooky cast of characters populating the town's underside.<br/><br/>As Jeffrey's increasing curiosity drags him further into a disturbing and potentially dangerous world, Lynch peppers us with contradictory images  those of blissfully innocent Americana right adjacent to some of the more disturbed sexual and moral conceptions you're going to find anywhere on screen. As the sweet Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) says as she considers Jeffrey's actions, "I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert." Just as MacLachlan's character is symbolic in nature (as well as serving an essential narrative role as the catalyst for unearthing all this darkness), so are many of the others we meet  wholesomeness is represented by Sandy, a local cop's daughter; perversion is represented by Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), in one of Hopper's classic maniac roles; and lost innocence is represented by Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini)  a tragic and tragically untalented lounge singer whose fate becomes Jeffrey's obsession.<br/><br/>What is so stunning about Blue Velvet is that its so refreshing and creates a completely new touch on thrillers. The film is jarring, to be sure, and packed with symbolism that might perplex viewers accustomed to Hollywood's more common fare that is painfully straightforward and absolutely literal. But there is a story that can be followed quite easily, there are several likable characters that Lynch has left reasonably understandable, and a beginning, middle and end to the proceedings.<br/><br/>The film is a stunning exploration into the dark and fierce that lies beneath all of us, no matter who deep down it is actual hidden. Damn, after re-watching this film after so many years, it is one hell of a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama/mystery but director David Lynch constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony and takes the thriller genre and turns it on its head. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade. How can the film exert a 7.8 out of 10 when it is considered a classic of American cinema? It's really deserving of a 8.9 or a 9.0 out of 10 in my honest opinion. Its simply because most of the people that inhabit an account on IMDb consider films like "The Matrix" and "Die Hard 4.0" masterpieces. Pssh! Which is clearly pathetic.<br/><br/>Out of all, this is easily Lynch's greatest film. It has the appeal and accessibility that most of his previous films lack, for example Eraserhead may appeal to those that enjoy expressionist cinema with no linear plot, and those that enjoy films that have plots and elements that are extremely hard to access would enjoy Lost Highway or Mulholland Dr., for those that like abstract films over all would enjoy Wild at Heart. The Elephant Man and The Straight Story where simply not memorable Lynch films because they don't have the unique touch he demonstrates expertly. Blue Velvet, on the other hand, isn't totally optimistic or off-putting with its plot. It has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence. Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in its grotesque way. This movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should never be denied. For example, the unforgettable villain of the film Frank Booth enjoys Heineken beer and classic music; he also enjoys raping people while sheers of blue velvet hang out of his mouth and screams "baby wants to **** blue velvet". Dennis Hopper truly deserved an Oscar for his performance. The rest of the dazzling cast (including Ingrid Bergman's daughter Isabella Rossellini, and Twin Peak's and Desperate Housewives's Kyle MacLachlan) all turn in sharp, convincing performances.<br/><br/>The atmosphere Lynch constructs is amazing. The stunning visuals make even the dark and gritty look stunning and heavenly, the musical counterpart is nightmarish and ties in with the films overall mystery perfectly, the metaphors and symbolism are expertly used. Blue Velvet is a film that will, unlike countless films of its kind, will stand the test of time as an all round masterpiece. The culprit of this films success is its blatant power to shock and disturb from time and time again. I saw it years ago on television; it was one of those Saturday nights where everyone lays low. The lights in my living room where dimmed, my girlfriend was in bed... and I watched it. I had to tape the last half it was so amazing. My verdict: a flat-out masterpiece.<br/><br/>It plunges the viewer into their deepest, darkest fears and it would be stupid to stop watching. I get the sense that the masterful Mr. Lynch put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured. He borrowed from his earlier life; claiming he had fantasies of sneaking into a girls bedroom and finding a missing piece to a murder puzzle. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. It is like a great work of abstract art, or "art about art." It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, excellent acting, unforgettable characters, stunningly arresting visuals and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. There is so much detail, like I said, and it would be an amazing feat and effort to go through at least one of them.<br/><br/>Most especially, it has Dennis Hopper. Who plays the psychotically bizarre sadist Frank Booth, he is the kind off villain the rivals Hannibal Lector (The Silence of the Lambs), Norman Bates (Psycho) or Billy Battes (GoodFellas). Hopper manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he looks at Jeffery and obsesses over the smallest detail ("its daddy you ****!"). I cannot believe, and refuse to believe, that Hopper did not receive an Oscar, let alone a nomination, for his GREATEST performance.<br/><br/>Frequently imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, Blue Velvet still isn't played out nearly 21 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to Lumberton, and have a nice little stroll around... to see what you find, and where it leads you. Now it is a strange world, huh? Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful, unforgettable nightmare you've ever had  this is David Lynch's Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>David Lynch's 1986 electrifying stunner Blue Velvet is a brilliantly crafted mystery film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of the decade, perhaps one of the most poignant American films ever made. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives and the many genres it cleverly overlaps (art-house, comedy, B-Film, snoop detective thriller) but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or characters and situations feel fake or wooden and out of date but are deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. What makes it so powerful is that it takes you to places you've seen only in your mind, in your deepest, darkest dreams. Thoughts you've had (like sneaking into a girls bedroom and witnessing a key to a murder mystery unfold right in front of your eyes) but never actually dared to pursue. Will he come out of this dark existence, or will he loose his innocence? Find out at your own risk.<br/><br/>Set in a small, North American town, Blue Velvet opens with peaceful, dream-like images of happy suburban existence. There is a man watering his beautifully pruned garden, filled with bright red roses, a fireman drives by waving, kids cross the street happily. Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, the man drops on the floor as a result of what seems to be a heart-attack. Then, disturbingly, a dog begins to drink the water that falls from the hose he was once holding. A baby then wanders along completely unknown and unharmed to what has just happened. What is so shocking is that innocence treads into the evil and harmful, unbeknown to them. The man is Jeffery Beaumont's father, who he has just visited in hospital. While wandering home, Jeffery comes across an ear that will eventually lead him into a disturbed, depraved existence that was seemingly non-existent in the idealistic town. The characters Jeffery encounters in the newly discovered underworld are bizarre and messed up. There is the mysterious femme fatale Dorothy Vallens, and her sadist rapist Frank Booth, who is holding her son and husband hostage.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, Blue Velvet is mostly without any faults and there really isn't much to criticize. Yes, it is off-putting and at times unflinchingly disturbing, but the viewer experiencing this and subsequently disliking it needs to realize that the kind off world depicted in Blue Velvet exists everywhere and there is evil that lurks and exists under almost everyone and everything. Nothing is innocent, as is brilliantly illustrated in this masterpiece. Just like the films tagline reads, "it's a strange world".isn't it? I remember way back in 86 that this film became one of the most talked about films of the year. I had no idea why, the first time I saw it I thought what a horrible mess. But I was 16 and was looking for something straight forward that did not really stimulate the viewer intellectually. However, about a year later I re-watched it and was engrossed by the power that is Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>The film traces the idea that there is good and evil in the world and it can be found in the smallest of idyllic places,and sometimes you don't even know its there, the sleepy and idealistically perfect village of lumberton as featured here is one such example. The film is heavy on the symbolism so it may be hard to sallow and digest in one viewer, so I can assure you that you must check Blue Velvet out twice.<br/><br/>The performances are top notch. Hopper's portrayal as Frank Booth is perhaps the most maddest performance of his career. There has been no character quite like Frank Booth: a murderer who snorts Nitrates through a gas mask. Thus he has become one of cinema's most terrifying villains. He embodies everything it means to be evil. Dorothy is the mysterious femme fatal, played by Isabella Rossellini (who strongly deserved an Oscar nom), Sandy, the "girl-next-door" and Jeffery Beaumount, the kind off "film noir hero". All of these rolls command complexity and the stars pull it off perfectly. David Lynch is amazing for having the strength to showcase darkest and most despairing side of human nature. This is clearly his most influential and amazing film, it has more appeal than his previous films, and owns the strength his later films lacked. However, Mulholland did come across as being very close to BV in quality and pure brilliance.<br/><br/>A voyeuristic and haunting nightmare into the dark and macabre. Blue Velvet is a flat-out masterpiece and undoubtedly Lynch's greatest work. After years of debate over weather I should see this film, I finally rented it today. I had to watch it again tonight to grasp the film properly. And when I did, I finally saw this film was really, and truly a cinematic visionary masterpiece.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" opens with a colorful picture postcard vision of small town America, set to the strains of the eponymous song. It seems so safe, so welcoming. Yet, by the time Lynch replays this sequence at the end of the film, we know that underneath this façade lies a terrifying reality.<br/><br/>Lynch's modern masterpiece is obsessed with the strangeness that hides in the nooks and crannies of suburban America. It's essentially a detective story, in which two all-American heroes, Jeffrey (MacLachlan) and Sandy (Dern), try to solve the mystery surrounding a chopped-off ear. In the process, they discover that their hometown isn't quite as boringly innocent as it first appears.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Lynch, I thought both The Elephant Man and Mulholland Dr. where extraordinary films, but I did not enjoy Eraserhead, because clearly it doesn't have the broad appeal of Blue Velvet and Lynch's films I previously mentioned, and Lost Highway was enjoyable and exctiting to watch, but really comes across as a weak version of Mulholland. Twin Peaks is amazing, yet I don't enjoy anything else he has done. It is messy and not at all coherent, but Blue Velvet is a different story. It is a film that shows evil can lurk in the darkest, seemingly harmless places. Blue Velvet has become a widely regarded cult classic in the decades since its initial release. It is understandable why. It is a beautiful, alluring, and haunting study of the corruption of innocence and good in the world. The tale could quite possibly happen anywhere in the world; and anyone and everyone can identify with the characters. Maybe not so much Frank Booth, but everyone has been tangled in a web of deceit and mayhem like Dorothy and Jeffery, and even little Sandy.<br/><br/>What is so great about Blue Velvet I wonder? Is it Dennis Hopper's breathtakingly accurate performance of a psychotic madman, Lynch's amazing and stylishly original direction, the performances, score? I think its a combination of all that. Blue Velvet has redefined thriller, and for so many reasons. This film has to be one of the greatest films American cinema has to offer. Not for all tastes, but definitely a classic. While I'm on the topic of great films, never look at what the IMDb top 250 has to offer; the list is awful and the selection is terrible. With influential cult films like 2001: A Space Odyssey under the mega-successful "Star Wars" and Blue Velvet, not even listed upon the list (although it is).you cannot take it seriously. It is a love story, a drama, a thriller. A film so rich, it works on so many levels its almost incredible to put your finger on what genre it actually belongs to.<br/><br/>The performances are incredible. Frank Booth is amazing; but he couldn't have been played by anyone else but Dennis Hopper. He really gets in touch with the complexity of the role, while MacLachlan and Rossellini turn in bravo-performances as two people caught between Frank's bizarre, sadistic games.<br/><br/>And the direction -- clearly fantastic from Lynch. While Mulholland is a close candidate for being his best; I cannot let Blue Velvet go unnoticed. I think a tie. None the less, a lot has been said about one of the most influential films of the decade; but now, please, see it for yourself. You won't forget it.<br/><br/>10/10. This was one of the most notorious, heavily discussed films released of the 1980s. It was controversial for its heavy, dark depiction on women, small-town America and life in general. It takes normal and mixes it with weird and disturbing. But its engrossing, and its thrilling, and it lives up to its status.<br/><br/>It goes into the sadistic underworld of a seemingly perfect town and as the camera focuses on beautiful red roses, it reveals a man is having a heart attack and zooms down to reveal a stash of swarming bugs. This establishes the clever metaphorical theme of an existing (but unknown) "underworld". Blue Velvet is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest films of the 21st century. Its spawned innumerable imitations and raised heated debate. But I can tell you, there is really nothing like it. So, see it for yourself! 10/10, and I don't throw this around often. In fact, I'd only really apply this to three other titles: Pulp Fiction, The Godfather and perhaps American Beauty.<br/><br/>P.S. Its a MAJOR travesty that its not yet on the Top 250, close, but not quite. Blue Velvet is a very weird film. It just gets weirder and weirder. But that seems to be its magic. Blue Velvet is an unsettling film that depicts the moral rot underlying the American Dream through arresting cinematic images that are at once realistic and surreal. The acting is really nothing short of brilliant. Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, who earnt his comeback for his influential villainous role, succeeds in creating the father we never wanted. While Jeffery, played by Kyle MacLachlan, shines as a young man loosing his innocence as he discovers a world of sleaze in his beautiful hometown. Isabella Rossellini plays washed up night club singer, Dorothy Vallens, in an amazingly complex performance. While Laura Dern plays Sandy, a young, innocent wallflower caught up in a bizarre murder mystery.<br/><br/>David Lynch finds himself at his personal peak. This film has long lived status as a bona-fide masterpiece and will continue this stature for years. Its cinematic influence can be seen from Heathers to American Beauty; but what is so amazing that it still shocks us and holds as in its grasp. A very easy ten out of ten.<br/><br/>Also check out Lynch's Mulholland Dr. and Lost Highway! Both films offer equally compelling experiences. Although the latter is not quite as good as the former ;D I remember seeing this little gem in cinema back when it came out in the late 1980s. I didn't know what to say, so I asked my girlfriend the same opinion. She said "its shocking they can get away with this" (referring to ingenious director David Lynch)...I agreed. It was perverse, and almost sickening to see the certain scenes play out. But I recently re-watched it just to get my head around it, maybe try and comprehend why it is so acclaimed, and I thought. Hmmm, damn good film. An electrifyingly original thriller; Blue Velvet examines an Americana, a seemingly picturesque labyrinth where evil is basically non-existent. Then it introduces as to Dorothy; a washed up night-club singer and her perverse stalker, Frank Booth. And it doesn't let up, it just gets darker and darker.<br/><br/>Lynch's fourth feature (and his best and most optimistically accessible) film still stands as a bona fide masterpiece, one of the few such films that actually was appreciated in its time and has perfectly weathered the 17 years since. I cannot willingly say I want to re-watch it because its almost unflinchingly disturbing. But I will never, ever, doubt its masterful quality. Ever. My girlfriend believes the same, she loves it today, but cannot re-watch it.<br/><br/>The film tackles so many genres and themes its amazing. Film noir, social disorder, sexual perversion, coming-of-age, goodness versus evil, loss of innocence set in a timeless, landlocked small town. Lynch gives his best direction yet. Eraserhead, a conventionally bizarre expressionist film is just not a universal appeal like Blue Velvet, and The Elephent Man just lacked the originality that Blue Velvet firmly grasped. The only comparable Lynchian production Blue Velvet is capable of standing against is the stunningly haunting Mulholland Dr., which deals with the loss of identity, similar to the stale and uninvolvingly pathetic Lost Highway. While LH examined all themes a Lynch film should; you easily loose interest after about the first 30-40 minuets. Wild at Heart was a sensational road movie, but its messed and incoherent compared BV. This is clearly his classic.<br/><br/>This film sits firmly on my top 10 films of all time. Because its a shocking journey into the America that was rarely seen in cinema before Blue Velvet was released. What is such a shame is that Blue Velvet's stature in cinema has created countless imitations that borrow its examination of suburbia at its worse. Take Happiness for example -- clever film that takes suburbia and inserts a dark view of life. If it wasn't for Blue Velvet's success, it would've been possible to market a film like Happiness. I am rarely ever mesmerized by cinema (although I do enjoy it), Blue Velvet was a MAJOR exception...it left me breathless, so haunted by what I had just seen. It was terrifying, funny, dark, beautiful, depraved, offbeat...there is not denial Blue Velvet is a masterpiece of American cinema.<br/><br/>I had read countless reviews that had nothing but praise to offer for both Lynch and Blue Velvet. I had seen various lists and polls that had ranked Blue Velvet as one of the greatest films. Its cultural impact was also undeniable; so I thought "I'll have to check out this cult classic sooner or later". I love cult films. From "Clockwork Orange" to "Pulp Fiction", but Blue Velvet was always one of those films I'd needed to get around to seeing, but never actually had. I had only ever seen one of Lynch's films, which was "Mulholland Dr", back in 2002. I was really put off by how un-involving the film had left me. I re-watched it on DVD about a year later and thought "my god, this film is America's answer to Fellini's "8 1/2"...it is destined to become a classic", so I finally put down a mental reminder to see Blue Velvet. And I did. What an experience.<br/><br/>The directing is amazing. The film is amazing because there are so little films that compare to its audacity and originality. It is partly a soap opera epic, kind off like the hard-core, dark version of "Leave it to Beaver" or "Happy Days"...set in this indistinguishable time frame. It could be the '50s, maybe the 60s? The 80s even? It is sort of a coming-of-age film, a film noir that combines elements of B-film and art-house cinema. And then there is the unforgettable characters, Frank Booth, one of cinema's evilest villains, and Dennis Hopper's performance is so stunning and real it is almost frightening.<br/><br/>I undoubtedly recommend Blue Velvet to the avid film buff. Those that cannot handle the dark or disturbing; avoid it. But if you do, in fact, take that advice. Please, one day, treat yourself to a viewing. You'll never see anything so powerful, so poetic, so beautiful, so beautiful, so dark, and so very horrifying. I'm going to give it a ten simply because twenty is not available on IMDb's rating system.<br/><br/>By Jeffery Wright (July 17, 2007) Blue Velvet is a prophetic masterpiece. Savor it on any level you desire. It's an engaging detective mystery. Emotions wash over you when viewed as a, if not the, most beautiful love story of our time.<br/><br/>Feel your mind turn stone cold, upon realizing, in 1986, Director Lynch and his ensemble provided a prophetic societal X-Ray.<br/><br/>It's all in Blue Velvet. If you've looked, you've seen. The Teachable readily grasp Lynch's stark metaphors. He doesn't beard incoherence with obtuseness. The Yellow Man metaphor is straightforward. He's a crooked narc. He wears a yellow jacket. He stings.<br/><br/>Kidnappings, vile 'public-private' partnerships - The Yellow Man's supplying of Frank Booth with dope looted from druggie corpses - white slavery, veiled paedophilia, all are well represented in Blue Velvet. <br/><br/>As Blue Velvet was crafted, the press stupidly quacked and pols self-servingly gushed of how Yuppie biz prowess would benefit society. Twenty years tells the tale. Bloated Hole-i-garchs use public 'partners' to loot a shrinking middle class of dwindling wealth and liberty.<br/><br/>Catherine Austin Fits states she read a thousand books in three years, to try to make sense of her ordeal by Judicial Terrorism. Like Jeffrey Beaumont, she saw things that others wished she hadn't. Thugs 'partner' with Court and other public officials to commit Judicial Terrorism - described as 'devious, deviant, and demonic' - against those who would bring them to justice.<br/><br/>Isn't this the same method by which Frank Booth ruins his enemies, via Detective T.R. Gordon, 'The Yellow Man'?<br/><br/>Ms. Fits' sage counsel: forget books. You're perplexed by baffling, vicious post-modern civilization? Answers await, at the video store.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet has them. Performances are majesterial. Frederick Elmes' cinematography projects the subconscious. Alan Splet weaves yet another haunting soundtrack, as masterfully he did previously, in Eraserhead. Blue Velvet holds up sturdily after twenty years of repeated viewings. <br/><br/>Blue Velvet is dark, funny, unsettling. Fraught with death and treachery, punctuated by Frank Booth's mental blocking of self-realizations, Lynch's film ultimately uplifts.<br/><br/>Laura Dern is a modern-day Beatrice. Frank Booth is Satan incarnate, a perfect representation of those who jacked the planet during the 1990s, and convinced many that poison was nectar. Kyle MacLachlan's hero is everyman, split twixt dark and light. Detective Williams, masterfully played by veteran George Dickerson, is Blue Velvet's balance wheel, the understated hero. Dorothy Vallens descends to seventh-floor hell - a twisted inverse of Dante's Seventh Circle of Paradise? - yet returns, blissfully reunited with her beloved son.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet reassures us, a just Creator won't indefinetly tolerate wickedness. The Yellow Man topples. He prefigures those who believe honor and expedience are the same thing.<br/><br/>Light demolishes both darkness, and the insects who revel in it.<br/><br/>Dr. Paul Vincent Zecchino<br/><br/>Manasota Key, Florida<br/><br/>12 July, 2007 Seriously, Blue Velvet has to be one of the greatest, most accomplished films ever made. And Frank Booth. Who could forget Mr Booth? What a great villain. How cool. So sick and menacing. Neato.<br/><br/>I see Blue Velvet is a surreal neo-noir. As such, it follows a standard noir mode of attack by peeling back societal facade in order to reveal cruelties and inhumanities beneath. What distinguishes Lynch's film is not this, but rather how Lynch manages to shoehorn this genre into a film that is as much Luis Bunuel (especially Un Chien Andalou, but also, to some degree, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie) as it is Raymond Chandler. That is, Blue Velvet is much more about his obsession with obsessions, perversity and other matters of the subconscious than it is with the systemic illnesses of the society.<br/><br/>Now, that's most certainly a distinct limitation of Lynch's cinematic world view, but it's one I'm willing to grant him because he creates such a peculiar and distinctive world of comic 50s Leave it to Beaver-ville suburbia and freaky 80s urban decay that the fact that he forgoes a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the systemic rot in favour of what can only be described as a repulsive portrait of personal perversity doesn't bother me nearly as much as it probably should have. I also give praise to the stunning cast who have clearly managed to play off such complex, lost characters.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a stunningly fascinating glimpse it a voyeuristic and dark underworld that lurks under every surface, human or object, place, whether be a small town or a endless metropolis. There is darkness everywhere. And like in Blue Velvet, you must face it to diminish it. 10/10 From the perspective of two decades later, Blue Velvet stands as a cinematic landmark. A film that marked cinema of the 1980s. A strange, alluring classic that has inspired filmmakers for years, its influence can even be seen in American Beauty (the roses, attention to detail, symbolism, dreamy feel).<br/><br/>The film is a coming-of-age mystery. It centers college student Jeffery Beamount, and his girlfriend, Sandy. The two are tangled up in a bizarre murder mystery that has rocked their seemingly perfect town. The murder mystery cracks the veneer of a strange and sadomasticistic underworld, which involves the psychotic, unforgettable Frank Booth, and his victim/hostage Dorothy Vallens, who he rapes on a daily bases -- if she declines, he threatens to murder her son and husband. Jeffery, after becoming romantically involved with Dorothy, sets out to stop Mr Booth.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet finds Mr Lynch at his personal peak. It surpasses Mulholland as one of his finest achievements. The film is dark, strange, beautiful, haunting, intriguing, pretentious, silly -- it is all of those things, but it is clearly a cinematic masterpiece. Its plot sounds nothing different to some Hollywood blockbuster/action-packed murder mystery. But it is far from that. There are many qualities that distinguish the film: shocking sexual episodes, startling juxtapositions that leave the viewer off-balance, uncertain and searching for more, and imagery and sounds that spark a complex emotional response. The performances are astonishing. Dennis Hopper, who portrays Frank Booth, has created a figure so terrifying he may even be one of the cinema's most haunting villains. MacLachlan who plays Beaumont, is stunning as the innocent young man in search of mystery, and Isabella Rossellini (another snub at the 1987 Oscars) is extremely affective as the distraught mother. Dern is also fantastic (although she doesn't quite match her co-stars with her minimal dialog) in her supporting role.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an astonishing and intrepid piece of film-making with the power to entertain and promote introspection and suspicious amongst its viewers from time to come. 10 out of 10. The camera sweeps over the beautiful, idealistic Lumberton, full of flowers, amiable people, and and happy suburban life. It then travels over to a man watering his garden, and at an almost unexpected moment, he collapses due to what it seems to be a heart attack. It then travels under ground into images of insects crawling all over each other. This will symbolize the discovery of a grotesque underworld hiding beneath the veneer of a seemingly perfect All-American town. This begins the disturbing events that transpire a classic known as Blue Velvet. <br/><br/>The directing from Lynch is marvelous, it is one of his most accomplished pictures. He has created one of the most intelligent, refreshing films I have ever seen. It may be dark and almost unflinching to watch; but it is an absolute thrill from start to finish. Nothing can top the terror you will experience in Blue Velvet. And its influence is a different story...the film was one of the most groundbreaking pictures the 1980s saw. It can even be described as the 1980s answer to Psycho. Its status as one of the greatest American films is indisputable. <br/><br/>***** out of ***** Blue Velvet is David Lynch in peak form, and represents (to date) his most accomplished, perhaps, along with Mulholland Dr., his most well-known motion picture. It is a work of fascinating scope and power that rivals any of the most subversive films to reach the screens during the 1980s. For Lynch, the sometimes-auteur, sometimes-illusionist, Blue Velvet was the movie that cemented his credentials as a filmmaker in a way that none of his previous efforts were able to. Blue Velvet also exhibits one of Lynch's most straightforward, optimistic plots. It details the disturbing underworld of a colorful American town, and a young mans attempts to put the seedy underworld to rest for good.<br/><br/>Watching Blue Velvet is not a pretty experience, and requires a strong constitution. Lynch is a demanding director, and some of the scenes in this movie take an unflinching look at the darker side of human nature. Frank Booth, one of the central figures of the underworld, is a monster without redeeming qualities who destroys, either physically or psychologically, everything he touches. Dorothy is diseased, but perhaps not beyond redemption, although Frank has corrupted her soul and stolen her happiness. Lynch does what he needs to do to show these things, and much of it is ugly.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet remains one of the most accomplished films of the 1980s, and some of Lynch's best work. It is a terrifying journey into the unknown, but a rewarding experience at that.<br/><br/>Highly recommended! David Lynch is one of our most brilliant and eccentric directors and has had this distinction for over 25 years. While he has had some very questionable films on his resume like Wild at Heart, Dune, and Lost Highway; he has had some jewels as well like The Elephant Man, Mulholland Dr., and The Straight Story. I say that Twin Peaks is his greatest achievement of any sort but if we are just talking his movies then BLUE VELVET is his ultimate crown-jewel.<br/><br/>This film, while very profane and off-the-wall, was also very smart, witty, original, and gripping! The acting was very good as well: Isabella Rosselini should have been nominated and WON the Oscar for this....it was a tour-de-force for playing someone who has to please a madman in such horrible ways in order to keep her son and husband alive. Kyle MacLachlan and deserved nominations but no wins as they are both great but still not as great as their other two co-stars.<br/><br/>The best performance in this movie is Dennis Hopper as one of the most sadistic and bizarre villains ever to hit the screen, Frank Booth. He was suspected to get nominated for this role and had the critics awards and a Golden Globe nod to back him up BUT he also had the movie HOOSIERS out that year and he got nominated for it probably because that role was more friendly and somewhat normal....at least he was nominated though albeit for the wrong role.<br/><br/>This is easily, IMO, the best film of the 80s and I will choose it over Raging Bull any day!! SUPERB!! David Lynch's influential 1986 thriller Blue Velvet opens with a colourful picture-perfect vision of small town America, set to the strains of the eponymous song. It seems so safe, so welcoming, so warm and so cosy. Yet, by the time Lynch replays this sequence at the end of the film, we know that underneath this façade lies a terrifying reality, where innocence dare not tread.<br/><br/>Lynch's modern masterpiece is obsessed with the strangeness that hides in the nooks and crannies of suburban America. It's essentially a detective story, in which two all-American heroes, Jeffrey (MacLachlan) and Sandy (Dern), try to solve the mystery surrounding a chopped-off ear. In the process, they discover that their hometown isn't quite as boringly innocent as it first appears. It also loosely combines elements of film-noir, being one of the greatest post-1950s films to do so.<br/><br/>What makes "Blue Velvet" so special, though, is the way in which Lynch turns this simple set-up into a psychosexual drama that would make even Freud shake his head in disbelief. Jeffrey and Sandy are babes in the woods who stumble into the very adult world of nightclub singer Dorothy (Rossellini) and her torturer-lover Frank (Hopper) - the big bad wolf in this Grimm fairy tale. What they witness is something that their mom and apple pie family life has never prepared them for - S/M, kidnapping, murder, and various sexual perversions.<br/><br/>A classic in its own right, Blue Velvet will go on to be one of the greatest American films ever made, despite the fact that many object to this because of its dark, almost unflinching content.<br/><br/>***** out of ***** I'm going to add my chorus of praise to this 80s gem. Nothing, and I repeat nothing has had such an impact on me as Blue Velvet did, when I first saw it on television several years ago. I was horrified beyond comprehension, but astounded at how amazing it was. The film details a young man who discovers, along with his teenage friend, a disturbing, violent underworld of a beautiful All-American town. What is interesting is Lynch has set this disturbing underworld in a Utopian, sort-of "1950s soap opera" town. All of the negations add to the film's uniqueness. It is a very exaggerated, yet effective method of pointing out hypocrisy. Overall, the film is brilliantly acted, darkly scripted, superbly directed, and has dazzling art and set direction.<br/><br/>The acting by MacLachlan was average, maybe even cartoonish. But this is clearly intentional, because this only adds to the feel of the soap opera kind off setting. However, Mr Dennis Hopper, could not be more brilliant as the terrifying perverse, and deranged antagonist. This was the perfect role for him, and he was simply brilliant. Hopper's character will forever be one of the most evil villains in the history of the movies. (thus being recognized in the AFI's 50 Greatest Villains). Isabella Rossellini turns in a fine performance as the damsel in distress, femme fatale Dorothy Vallens, as does Laura Dern.<br/><br/>The directing, honestly, could not be better. Lynch deserved the Oscar for Best Director. This is one of his greatest films, and undoubtedly, or along with Mulholland Dr., his trademark film. It even tops the cult classic Eraserhead, and the unflinchingly sad Elephant Man.<br/><br/>The story gives itself to you; if you do some critical thinking, you will get more about the characters and their motives. I don't think you will get lost if you just watch the movie, but I do think you will miss out on some really cool details, but that is up to you, the viewer. An absolute stunner. The greatest, most refreshing film I've ever seen. I'm giving it a ten because a twenty is not a valid rating on the IMDb.<br/><br/>I'm now off to buy the DVD! By far one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, Blue Velvet continues to hold viewers in its grasp long of the credits roll by. Why? It is a masterpiece, pure and simple. We have interesting, well-developed characters, we have an evil, unforgettable villain (Frank Booth), lustful visuals, an amazing score, and a story like no other.<br/><br/>The film revolves around clean-cut young teenager Jefery Beamount, who discovers a human air lying in a grass field while returning home from visiting his father in hospital. As he follows the crime himself, he digs deeper into a lurid, terrifying underworld of his seemingly pristine All-American town.<br/><br/>If you can stomach the offbeat and eccentric, Blue Velvet is undoubtedly you're movie! Let's be honest - the only good thing about this film is Dennis Hopper's performance as a psychopath.<br/><br/>Okay, so it's a damn good performance, but it doesn't deserve to be in a dull, otherwise poorly acted, snooze-fest like this. There's no believable interest between the male and female leads, (Mac-however it's spelt and Rosallini) and all this film serves as is an example of how over-rated Lynch and his works (particularly the God-awful Twin Peaks) are.<br/><br/>Rent it if you're curious or want to watch (be awed by) Hopper, otherwise give it a miss.<br/><br/>A waste of time. Title: Blue Velvet <br/><br/>Cast: Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini.<br/><br/>Production Year: 1986 <br/><br/>Director: David Lynch <br/><br/>Rating out of Five: Five<br/><br/>Blue Velvet, Blue Velvet, Blue Velvet. I saw this film for the first time today, and was amazed at its audacity. Its a stunning film, strange, but alluring and beautiful. David Lynch (Mulholland Dr., The Elephant Man, Eraserhead) has created this masterful vision of a dark and ghastly underworld, beneath the veneer of an almost-perfect small, neat and sleepy All-American town. The film begins with young Jeffery Beaumont, who discovers a human ear in a field of overgrown grass, and takes it the police.<br/><br/>When they refuse to begin an investigation, Jeffery conducts it himself with the help of a town sheriff's daughter, Sandy. What the two discover is bizarre and one of the scariest villains to grace our screen, rapist / homicidal kidnapper Frank Booth (ok, so why didn't Dennis Hopper covet an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor???)...the rest is a puzzle that I will not dare to spoil, you must see it for yourself. Although, do it at your own risk, the film can be very graphic at times, however I can see why it became one of the most influential films to grace the silver screen! This title is certainly worthy of nothing under five out of five. Blue Velvet (five stars)<br/><br/>Director: David Lynch Writer: David Lynch Cast: Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern Runtime: 120 minutes Certificate: 18 Year: 1986 Country: US<br/><br/>A bizarre cult thriller. A sex-crime story of middle-America's dark underbelly. A garish detective story. Or was it all a young man's dream? David Lynch's iconic 80's movie is all of these and more. Film students pore over whether it is a modern fairytale or an Oedipal voyage through perversity.<br/><br/>College boy Jeff finds a severed human ear on waste ground and takes it to his dad's friend, Detective Williams. Filled with boyish adventure and amorous longing for Williams' daughter, Sandy, Jeff concocts a daring plan with her to spy on a strange woman, Dorothy Vallens, who is perhaps implicated in something dodgy. It turns out Dorothy is being blackmailed by a shockingly malevolent and vicious criminal called Frank  who gets high before committing his most gruesome acts.<br/><br/>You don't want to know Frank. He's the stuff of nightmares. Sandy is apple-pie goodness and Dorothy is more a "come-to-my-bedroom", "do-you-want-to-do-bad-things" type-of-girl. But before Jeff can say Sacher Masoch or think up novel uses for soft fluffy fabrics, the semi-impotent Frank is happy to initiate him  at knifepoint down at Pussy Heaven bordello.<br/><br/>Dorothy sings at the local Go Slow nightclub. It's respectable enough, but hardly the place you'd think to find clean-cut kids like Jeff and Sandy. Not to mention her manically jealous boyfriend, Mike. And if the sight of a naked, half-crazed Isabella Rossellini on Jeff's front lawn is going to disturb you, please don't go and see this movie. (As inspiration for this scene, Rossellini, who plays Dorothy, says she used the famous photo by Nick Ut of the Vietnam girl walking naked after a napalm-bomb attack.)<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is controversial stuff. Not just for scenes of sexual violence (including non-consensual ones) but because tension between polar opposites is at the heart of the film. Long before American Beauty, Blue Velvet strips the veneer off the popular image of the USA. Sandy's pristine (but sterile) American-dream world contrasts poignantly with the more lurid, adults-only side of America symbolised by Dorothy, who is struggling to regain  if not exactly innocence  a safe and happy medium.<br/><br/>A number of of the themes and motifs seem deliberate  such as Jeff's tormented sexual awakening  he's faced with either a girl who 'doesn't give out' on one hand or a dangerous vamp on the other. Some however are natural echoes of the psychology reflected in folklore (such as when innocent youngsters enter a dark wood).<br/><br/>Blatantly 'inappropriate' music repeatedly evokes emotional outrage in us on behalf of victims. Roy Orbison's ballad, 'In Dreams', plays as we watch a vicious beating. 'Blue Velvet' is Frank's favourite song and, in the film, connected with rape. 'Love Letters' are code for bullets. The effect is unsettling, a bit like the use of the song 'Singing in the Rain' in A Clockwork Orange. The emotional dislocation is also the stuff cult movies are made of.<br/><br/>References to other films abound. Dorothy suggests The Wizard of Oz, clad in red shoes but definitely no longer in Kansas. Sandy has the home-grown goodness of her namesake in the musical Grease. Jeff spying on Dorothy recalls the voyeuristic 'Jeff' from Rear Window. Many have found parallels with It's a Wonderful Life. But Blue Velvet transcends all these in its ability simultaneously to convey meaning on so many levels.<br/><br/>In some of Lynch's later films, surreal flights into fantasy can be subtle and obligatory. But in Blue Velvet, the audience is left to decide. Speaking of the severed ear, Lynch said, "It had to be an ear because it's an opening. An ear is wide and, as it narrows, you can go down into it. And it goes somewhere vast . . ."<br/><br/>New American Gothic? Shot on a very tight budget, Blue Velvet remains one of the most influential films of the 80's. It also includes the sort of quasi-mystical mystery-dialogue that would become a Lynch staple. "I'm seeing something that was always hidden. . . . I'm in the middle of a mystery  and it's all secret." The 'mystery' is also what eventually pulls Sandy out of her too-good-to-be-true cubby-hole in more ways than one: "You're a mystery. I like you  very much," says Jeff. Then he snogs her face off. "Where's my dream?" she asks later (Jeff having just demolished it for her).<br/><br/>Perhaps it is the eroticism that encapsulates the final contrast between what is known and what is not. Much of it, though undoubtedly powerful, is implied. For instance, when Dorothy's breasts are first exposed they are out of focus, whereas her bright red, sensuous lips are sharply in focus and become strongly emblematic of sexuality throughout the movie. Like the night sky, darkness in Blue Velvet lets our imagination come alive. Blue Velvet ****<br/><br/>When I was just a young internet amateur, I read a lot of reviews of a strange movie called Blue Velvet by David Lynch. However it took at least about six years until I got a copy of the DVD. And I have to say that this is one of the best movies of the 1980's. Blue Velvet is a well thought-out story. In the documentary, Mysteries Of Love, Lynch said he rewrote the script several times.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Jeffrey Beaumont, played by Kyle MacLachlan, finding an ear in a field. Jeffrey takes the ear to the police and meets Sandy Williams, played by Laura Dern, who gets sucked into Jeffrey's own obsession of finding out where the ear came from. From what Sandy heard from her father, who is the investigating officer, the police has surveillanced a woman by the name of Dorothy Vallens, played by Isabella Rossellini, who we later find out that the ear belongs to her husband who has been kidnapped by the psychotic Frank Booth, played by the great Dennis Hopper. Booth is fierce beast who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.<br/><br/>The movie goes deeper than this but you really have to watch the movie to really experience the total effectiveness of Blue Velvet. It is a great movie! Anyone who has ever lived in a small community where normality is assumed probably also suspects that beneath the surface of everyday life lurk malevolent happenings. Blue Velvet is about the moral rot underlying the seemingly hopeful and idealistic American Dream, the loss of innocence and the human psyche at its worse.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet explores the dark side of human relationships built upon power and perversion. This film, written and directed by one of my favourite directors, David Lynch (Eraserhead, Mulholland Dr., The Elephnt Man) is one of the most hallucinatory, interesting movies ever released in the history of cinema. It elicited a wildly divergent critical and commercial response upon its release ranging from laudatory praise to complete damnation. It is not a movie for everyone. Those who savor exotic experiences are sure to find it both frenzied and exhilarating. I found it the later, Blue Velvet is a visually stunning film, it has beautiful, haunting and unforgettable images cleverly combined with dark nightmarish scenes some of which may never leave my mind. Any film that manages to accomplish that upon the viewer deserves considerable praise.<br/><br/>The performances are exceptional, and brutally honest. Especially the ones that come from the leading man Kyle MacLachlan. All of the actors seemed to fit their characters perfectly, especially Dennis Hooper (a MAJOR Oscar snub), who is terrifyingly abnormal and pure evil as one of the best cinema villains to grace the silver screen. Laura Dern and Isabella Rossellini are both among the top notch, exceptional cast. The film is filled with complex and unusual characters and the fact that the cast could pull them of in such a way is extraordinary.<br/><br/>What is so stunning about Blue Velvet is its visual appeal. Laced with arresting beautiful and horrifying images that range from realistic and surreal. The music on the soundtrack demonstrates the eerie effects of many songs (including Roy Orbison's "In Dreams", in a karaoke scene from hell), which can transport us and have great impact on us, into realms of nostalgia and fantasy. And what is so scary about this film is that despite its heavy dosages of surrealism and fantasy, the film is very realistic while it showcases surrealism at the same time. What is so scary is this kind of underworld could exist absolutely anywhere, and was is even more chilling is that it already does. <br/><br/>Despite its countless inferior imitations and stylistic features that have been borrowed, stolen and reused over and over again, the film will remain the pinnacle of them all. Blue Velvet should be watched multiple times for the viewer to fully digest and appreciate the experience of what is an unprecedented, flawless and remarkably original masterpiece that has changed the face of cinema. Undoubtedly worthy of a ten out of ten.<br/><br/>See It If You Liked: American Beauty, Lantana and Mulholland Drive What makes a movie great? Of course this is a question that will vary from person to person. Some will say that an amazing movie has to be entertaining. Others might claim it needs to have some kind of educational value. And a select few may even say a brilliant cinematic experience will need unforgettable acting, or maybe even direction. I for one think a really superb movie needs to touch a chord somewhere deep inside of you. A film doesn't necessarily have to be entertaining. At the very least you should never forget it.<br/><br/>So under this definition, Blue Velvet is a wonderful movie. Filled with extraordinary scenes that are truly impossible to forget, the film does something to you. Its hard to say exactly what. There's just something deep within you that's changed. For example, after seeing the movie again, don't you just start to see Frank Boothes all over the place? Don't you imagine what people are doing behind the locked doors of suburban houses? And whenever you hear Roy Orbison's classic 'In Dreams' don't you just imagine a teary eyed Dennis Hopper, a beleaguered Kyle MacLachlan and a completely insane Dean Stockwell?<br/><br/>Blue Velvet ripped our ideal of suburbia apart. It made us realise that we are a world of closed doors. White-washed houses, plain picket fences...aren't they all just smoke and mirrors used to hide the truth inside?<br/><br/>Many people have compared Blue Velvet to American Beauty and its not difficult to see why. Both films expose the lies and hypocrisy of middle America, although of course they both do it in very different ways.<br/><br/>However Blue Velvet is not just concerned with tearing Middle-America apart. It also questions our role as a viewer. In some of the scenes Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) watches Issabella Rosselini undress while hiding in a cupboard. Through the discreet use of a few point of view shots Lynch questions who we are. He almost wants us to delight in seeing Rosselini's bare flesh. Because really as human beings, isn't it sex that drives us at heart? This is what Lynch sets out to question and he does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>In conclusion Blue Velvet is a wonderful movie. You won't forget it easily. From the start of Blue Velvet, which is a man who is hosing his garden suddenly has a heart attack (And I believe water in his ear) This brings you, the viewer of this movie to either turn back now, or be lured into the dark and mysterious undergrounds of Blue Vlevet.<br/><br/>The Main Character, Jeffery Beaumont(Kyle MacLachlan) is a simple man with a sickly father in the hospital who one day discovers a severed ear in a field. This is a bizarre finding, considering the town has a radio station who support the town of Lumberton and it's main resource, well lumber. But in a David Lynch Film, everything you think you know is thrown out the back door and weird is the norm.<br/><br/>After showing this ear to Lumberton's head detective, John Williams, who just so happens to have a young daughter, Sandy (The naive Laura Dern who totally changes her role in another Lynch film, Wild at Heart) To make a long story short, Sandy knows something about this ear, and about a disturbed woman who also knows about the ear. She is a nightclub singer named Dorthey Vallens(Issabella Rossalini portraying one of if not the most disturbed and humiliated women ever in a film) Jeffery is anxious find out about the ear and about the woman, and then the story goes from slightly odd and seemingly harmless to disturbing and unsettling. This happens when you first see Frank Booth, one of the creepiest rapist/villain you could find anywhere. But, before he appears, Jeffery Beaumont, who is trying to find out evidence about Dorthey, and is caught hiding in her closet and accused of being a peeping tom freak who gets sick pleasure by watching women change their clothes. Soon, he is forced to strip and then has to hide in the closet and watch Dorthey be degraded by Frank in the most horrible and disturbing scene filmed. This is only the beginning.<br/><br/>After this, we learn that frank has Dorthey's child and husband who is one ear short. Not only that, but we dive deeper into the creepy world only David Lynch can create. This includes an unforgettable evening and scene with Ben, a bizarre pimp with an equally bizarre behavior, (Not many people lip sync to Roy Orrbison's In Dreams) as well as Dorthey being dumped on the front lawn naked. All of these events lead up to an ending that is actually happy and resolves all of the problems, which is only as odd as Frank. <br/><br/>I recommend this film only to people who are mature and have a strong stomach. I won't say an age, because some teens can handle it, while some adults cannot. If any part of this review unsettles you, the you shouldn't see this film, if not then enjoy this masterpiece, Blue Velvet. What would you say of nightmares? The sheer, visceral visions and images that flash in our minds can be terrifying. You awake unnerved and in a panic, clutching your sheets and embracing the safety of your bed. Yet, these same horrifying nightly episodes are a glimpse at the underlying dark componets of your every day life. It's these fascinating and frightening revelations that director David Lynch portraits in his masterpiece Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>Set in the sleepy eastern North Carolina town of Lumberton, we are taken on a circumstantial journey into the unknown as seen through the eyes of Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle McLaughlin). He is our youthful ambassador to the film, armed with innocence and humility to combat not only the dark forces centered around his home town, but also his own inner weaknesses.<br/><br/>What makes this film stand out most is the realism. Whether it be the sound of wind blowing through tree leaves at night, or the busy, alien look of ants franticly working, David Lynch touches a chord with the derivative motion of everyday life. Thus creating a tangible backdrop where the film's focus could be studied more closely.<br/><br/>The attention of the picture is drawn to the mysteries of love. At times beautiful and at others sadistic, we begin to see a sort of duality to love played out between Jeffery and the movie's antagonist Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). It is a clash of the selfish and the selfless, showing the thin red line that choice creates to separate the two.<br/><br/>The film flows like a dream. You see a strange familiarity prompting your attention, and before you know it you are moving along the same harrowing path as Jeffery, wanting revelation and seeking redemption. At times the shocking, carnal imagery encroaches into your conscious, leaving you breathless and shaken. Written from a series of nightmares director David Lynch experienced, Blue Velvet is an emotional tour de force. Some may see it as film-noir, showcasing the dark side of humanity. I wouldn't disagree entirely, however I feel it also relays selfless love, hope and humility. It all depends on what one let's overshadow them independently. Bottom line is the story, like life, is layered, dynamic, and a bit odd. Indeed it is a strange world. Usually when I see a movie that is 'universally hailed as the most controversial film of the decade' they end up having been widely misinterpreted - such as The Silence of the Lambs, which wasn't 'sick' like everybody said, but merely portrayed the hypnotic effect of a consuming nature of evil, by drawing the viewer into it too. But Blue Velvet was the only film I've seen to date that shocked me far more than I thought it would. It's hard to say exactly what it was, but it did such a grotesquely fine job of carving out sickness from beneath an idyllic front that it couldn't help but be disturbing. It's also partly because David Lynch is a genius - some of the camera angles alone are enough to give you nightmares. Jeffrey is a young guy visiting his hometown when his father has a stroke. He finds a human ear in a field, and when he tries to find out more about it independently, he's drawn farther and farther into the world of sado-masochistic violence via Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini in a troubling role) and her tormentor, until he uncovers some unsavory findings about his own soul. Dennis Hopper - from Easy Rider - gives an absolutely disgusting performance as Frank. I mean, really, really disgusting. This from a person who thought Hannibal Lecter was kind of cool - trust me on this. All in all, the satirical film-making and saturated color, together with Rossellini's and Hopper's performances, make it really disturbing. By uncovering the hypocrisy in the idyllic front of a small town, the film uncovers the hypocrisy within everyone's soul. Because, no matter how repulsive some of it is, aren't we, against our own wills, irresistibly drawn to some of this perversion? We'd like to say we're all perfect, that it holds no attraction, but the fact is it does, no matter what we try to do about it. Is it really better to attempt to cover it up? Or is it better to surrender entirely to the dark forces within our natures, and thus release ourselves? And can we ever be one thing, or are we essentially divided? These are only some of the issues approached - it's a great film, but I wouldn't want to watch it again. Oh Candy Coulerd Clown.....<br/><br/>David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" was one of the most influential films of the 1980's, and arguably jump-started the idea of independent film-making. But aside from that, it is also one of the most original, invigorating films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>In a tour de force opening sequence, which has been widely praised, brightly-lit, picture-perfect clips are shown of a small town: a man watering his green lawn, a milkman waving as his truck drives by, flowers blooming beside a picket fence...and then the happiness of the scene vanishes as the man watering his lawn collapses on the ground, and the camera slowly burrows down through the glass until it comes upon a mound of bugs, symbolizing the dark secrets buried in the seemingly perfect town.<br/><br/>The film then switches to a college student (Kyle MacLachlan) returning to his hometown of Lumberton to stay for awhile and visit his father in the hospital. While walking through a field, he spots a human ear lying on the ground, which leads to him meeting up with the town's sheriff's teenage daughter (Laura Dern), and convincing her to help him out to solve the mystery of the ear, which involves a nightclub singer (Isabella Rossellini), murder, and a sadistic kidnapper/drug dealer (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>My opinion:<br/><br/>This movie is underrated and by a lot of people mis understood ! i am happy to see the IMDb staff give this movie a 9.<br/><br/>It has got Amazing performances by Dennis Hopper and Kyle Maclachlan, They are both so convincing... I like David lynch a lot (my favorite Director) and with blue velvet he shows us the best a director can do .. he should have won an Oscar for his directing skills instead oliver stone did with platoon! (i like platoon also but the directing in Blue velvet goes so much further) Lynch shows us how you can make a good movie with a very small Budget. He knows how to make his characters ,locations and soundtrack mysterious and that's the power of Blue Velvet and other Lynch movies.<br/><br/>I love this film! And it could be considered the best from the 80's and even today it can compete with the best.... A Masterpiece !<br/><br/>Listed in my top 3 of all time<br/><br/>9.7 out of 10 Film being such a social experience, it is surprising how the perceptions of others can influence your reading of a particular drama. I first saw this film in a packed house in Paddington in Sydney, and my girlfriend and I were practically the only heterosexuals in the place. The audience howled with laughter from the opening montage and this continued unabated throughout. They went into communal paroxysms at the scene where Frank makes his first appearance, and by the time he was raping Dorothy, were LITERALLY rolling on the floor amongst the spilt popcorn and beating their fists on the carpet like demented children. I've seen quiffed rockers seriously hooning it up at the 1962 premiere of Kid Galahad in a small town, and have worked as a bouncer at our local cinema for teen film marathons which can get pretty rowdy, but I've never seen such sheer hysterical carryings on from an audience as that screening of Lynch's film. I came away in a pretty bad mood from the whole thing and virtually dismissed the film. I was later persuaded to get it out on DVD, and it took on a completely different light, I began to view it as a masterpiece of dry satire on the American small-town paradise Andy Hardy image. It had a halo of confrontational excellence, which appealed to my admittedly dark sense of humour, and went where no other mainstream film or director had been, or would dare to go. Being able to hear the actual dialogue was a big plus as well, and I cherished every nuance. Watching it again nearly 20 years later, I now see what that bunch of screamers were laughing at: it is as camp as it gets, and possibly I couldn't see it at the time because to my particular view it was primarily the work of a auteur, and only coincidentally a piece of entertainment. They saw a riotously knowing take on post-modern sensibility, and were in on the joke. I saw a serious work of art breaking down barriers. Whether it is both, or falls somewhere between, is up to the preconceptions of the viewer. When BLUE VELVET opened nearly 20 years ago, I was in college and studying film. The release of the movie sent shockwaves through the department. Although I have probably only seen the movie once or twice since its initial release, I rediscovered it this week and boy, does it hold up well. Lynch's genius begins in the first shot (opening credits) with the oddly organic curtains undulating to the romanticized strains of Angelo Badalamenti's deceptively perfect score. He cuts to an impossibly blue sky then pans down to an impossibly white picket fence and an impossibly red rose -- the American flag in three dimension. How lush, how patriotic, how wholesome. ... And then he undermines seconds later with a disturbing sequence where a man has a seizure, collapses on the ground and the camera dives underground to the voracious sounds of feeding insects. In three minutes, Lynch wordlessly uses visual and sound design viscerally, while trading on an understanding of American iconography which he satirically undercuts. The imagery, sense of dark humor, deadpan style and individuality of voice continue to influence the best of filmmakers today. I cannot imagine a world without it. Blue Velvet is dark, scary, freaky, and really good. Which is how you cold describe most of David Lynch's films. His films are often filled with symbolism and it is easy to finish one of his films and have no real idea of what actually happened. They usually take two or three viewings, and a little research to get a good idea what the movie is actually trying to convey. Blue Velvet has a simpler plot that can generally be understood at a basic level upon first viewing, but there is plenty of symbolism and deeper meaning to make it "enjoyable" for further viewings. I put enjoyable in quotation marks because to many watching it is not an enjoyable experience. It is a movie deep seated in horror, with scenes that make you crawl under the covers and lock the doors. For the cinephile it is a type of pleasure to watch a lurid piece of cinema with enough depth to require multiple viewings. For the weekend movie watcher it is probably too much to stomach.<br/><br/>The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town. It's a town where every day has blue skies, manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple people. Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures straight out of fifties television shows. But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long. Quickly a nice old man who is watering his lawn falls down near death. The camera pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass. Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs. The idyllic town is only pretty on the surface. Underneath the top layer of goodness lies a darker, seedier town hidden from the eyes of most of its citizens.<br/><br/>The plot of the film revolves around Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern delving deeper and deeper into the darker side of the small town. MacLachlan finds a dismembered ear on his walk home from the hospital one afternoon. Finding such a macabre in his hometown sparks a quest to discover who's head the ear could belong to and why it was removed. He involves the good girl Laura Dern in his quest and they sink into darker waters. To tell more of the plot is to give away too much. I'll just say that it is not for the weak of heart.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper plays one of cinemas creepiest villains to date. His psychosis is even more terrifying in that it is so real. Here is no Freddy Krueger, or even a Hannibal Lector. This is not some crazed psychopath lurking in the corner. Sure he is psychotic, and maniacal, but versions of him can be found almost nightly in any major city newspaper. He is not a homicidal maniac, but a violent, evil man made even more so by his addiction to unnamed drugs.<br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini plays Dorothy Valens with such beauty and sadness it breaks your heart as it squirms your stomach. Her character has taken such horrible abuse over her life she has come to like and enjoy it. Mixed with heavy amounts masochism her performance is remarkable.<br/><br/>There were several times while watching this with my wife, Amy that she said she couldn't keep watching it. After the credits rolled she said she would never watch it again. I suspect this is the sentiments of many viewers after watching Blue Velvet. But if you can stomach the violence, masochism and overall creepiness there is a lot of pure cinema to study. Dark side which is in of us all, something we all try to depress deep in side of us, never wanting to show it to anyone. That could be one interpretation from "Blue Velvet".<br/><br/>But then again, it just might be strange, strange world.<br/><br/>But as David Lynch has said, he doesn't like to explain his movies: he wants the viewer to do it himself. That is a rare thing in movies. Not only these days, but it has always been. That makes Davind Lynch an artist he is.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLahlan plays the role of young Jeffrey Beaumont, who one day finds an ear from the field. He brings it to a familiar detective, John Williams (George Dickerson), but as Jeffrey is keen on mysteries, he want's to find out about the ear himself. So he, and daughter of John, Sandy (Laura Dern) begin their own investigation.<br/><br/>Soon they find out, that the ear belongs to a kidnapped husband of a lounge singer Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rosselini), who is harassed by psychotic Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>This takes Jeffrey to a ride in the dark and twisted road of Frank Booths sadistic existence.<br/><br/>It's a strange world, as the tag line of the movie says. It's rare thing to hear a tag line, which describes the world of a movie so accurately. "Blue Velvet" goes through every human emotion, from hatred to love, and it does it without pain or struggle. Narrative ways, of course, there is lot's of fear and pain in the plot itself.<br/><br/>But there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Remember that. This is a film that starts with a nice view of an idealistic part of small town America, but quickly descends into the bizarre, chaotic, and even terrifying. The opening scene is particularly interesting as it sets the tone for the rest of the movie: there is something sick beneath this small town. A young man inadvertently gets more then he bargained for when his curiosity about a strange find in a field propels him to do some investigating.<br/><br/>Also one cannot help but mention the role of Frank Booth by Dennis Hopper. Frank is one of the great cinematic psychos right up there with all of your favorites. He gets angered by pretty much everything from beer ("Heineken? F--- that s--- !") to meeting people for the first time ("Who is this f--- ?"). And he is a more realistic psycho who isn't in the Mike Myers and Jason Voorhees crowd, but rather with your Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter group.<br/><br/>The resulting film is, at once, interesting, unsettling, and even scary at times. Just the thought that such a nice little place as a quiet town (slightly more urban than Twin Peaks) could house such gross people, or more metaphorically, house evil. And it is the metaphor that makes this film as good as it is. The town is never really identified as anything particular so it could be anywhere. Maybe even the next town over from where you live... 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R: strong profanity and gritty themes This is the ultimate cult classic film. I judge the greatness of a movie by the number of times I will re-watch it. And since I've seen this movie more than any other film, I give it top marks. This movie may not be for everyone, it is subtly dark and ridden with mystery. But no matter how many times I see this film Dennis Hopper who plays the freaky Frank Booth leaves me in stitches from laughter. I must admit though, I do have a slight dark sense of humour and you kinda have to in order to get David Lynch's films. His movies move in a slow bizarre twisted manner. The character 'Ben' played by Dean Stockwell is the most amusing and utterly entertaining out of all the rest. I will never get sick of seeing this film. It is my favourite Lynch film, the only other one that nears it is "Wild At Heart". In the days of hopelessly overbugeted films and trashy remakes it seems that their are few originals working. It is also ironic that this superb film came of the back of a hopelessly bloated blockbuster. Blue Velvet is an original, haunting masterpiece. Filled with ambiguous images, haunting shots and surreal scenes it may not be for all tastes sure, but no one can deny its power and viscerality. Dennis Hopper WILL never get a better role to showcase his talent and gives a masterclass in psycho. Forget Perkins and Hopkins, Hopper's character is as scary and haunting as he is psychotic. A truly original piece of work that stands up as a fantastic achievement in modern film. God bless you Lynch. I caught this film again last night (on the Sundance Channel), after having seen it a few times when it was first released. I'm a Lynch fan because at least with his films you know you're in for something provocative, and Blue Velvet certainly doesn't disappoint in that area.  As I mentioned, I hadn't seen the movie for a few years, and this time, rather than focusing so much on Hopper's over-the-top scene-stealing extravaganza of a performance, I found myself enjoying Kyle McLachlan's subtle and under-stated portrayal of Jeffrey, which is, in reality, the heart of the film. <br/><br/>
Without Jeffrey to bridge the gap between the two worlds, Blue Velvet wouldn't exist, it would be just a freak show. It's this character - and specifically, his willingness to explore what's going on beneath the surface of things in his perversely Pollyanna-type town - that makes the film cohesive (ok, SEMI-cohesive) on any level, and McLachlan instinctively plays all his scenes with a brilliant, innate understanding of his character's position.  I don't think he's gotten any credit for what he brings to this twisted equation, and it's high time (no pun intended) he got some. Another exuberant celebration of film making. Most people would not think so, for a simple reason, they aren't into David lynch's unique style, it's like nonother, it's art in it's purest form.<br/><br/>That is what Lynch is, an artist, not a film maker. Given that he does make films, not in the normal definition of a film, that is what makes him standout from his peers. This movie should of of gotten 4 stars but some people just don't understand it I guess, seeing a lynch movie is enlightening, for the mind and the soul. David Lynch is the best director ever for these reasons. Dean stockwell steals the movie with his lip synching of roy orbison's "in dreams". it makes me laugh everytime i see it David Lynch's Blue Velvet is great. And by great I actually mean great. Not good by Lynch standards. I really have never been a huge fan of of anything he's done, but this movie is an extremely captivating look at suburbia. It's coherent, plot-driven and engrossing. The stark contrast between the suburbia inhabited by machlachlan and dern and the frank booth character's depraved world is a simple but extremely effective device Lynch uses to comment on not only Suburbia, but American culture as well. The music was also excellent (especially the Roy Orbison "In Dreams" sequence with Dean Stockwell). Anyway, this movie, contrary to some people's opinions, is David Lynch's nonpretentious and ultimately successful attempt at a serious statement on the decay and hollowness of suburban america. Enjoy it, bitches! [No spoilers]<br/><br/>Blue Velvet (1986) is as close as you get to the real David Lynch. The film is a provocative rave about what NOT happens in what could be every town in the US. But to Lynch, everything that doesn't happen happens - but not on the surface. This is also the theme in his Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. In Blue Velvet this 'America beneath the surface' is quickly summarized in the beginning of the movie with a simple camera movement from surface shots to underground shots. These surface/underground distinctions are brilliantly spread throughout the movie by Lynch. He is using almost every frame to expose this shallowness that he sees in society.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is centered around Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan) who finds a cut-off human ear in a field and turns it in to the police. He decides to do his own investigation which leads him into this underground society which to Lynch is so in contrast to the life lead on the surface even though the two worlds coexist in the same town. His findings are horrible but Lynch takes us through every upsetting moment of this venture into the unknown. Jeffrey is the parallel between surface life and the beneath and he is split up because he doesn't know which is the better. He is divided between maintaining the superficiality and giving in to his urges.<br/><br/>The film caused a great upset when it was released because of its complex nature. Lynch likes to provoke people in this way, and he did. He is obsessed with small-town America and the way life goes on in these clusters of human habitats. He knows that he can twist people's minds when he makes a film about something that doesn't happen because people don't want it to. But it happens whether people like it or not, that's it. Drugs and abuse are out there, and Lynch is one of the people that shows us that it might happen next door in small-town America on an everyday afternoon with the sun shining and dogs barking. He uses all kinds of symbols to show us what we don't want to see. And he does it in a great way. Blue Velvet is a provocative film that almost makes your stomach turn when he puts you through scenes of abuse with music(!) running in the background. Notice the use of songs and music (by A. Badalamenti) in this film - the songs creates contrasts rarely seen in films save other Lynch pictures. Truely a great piece of art that makes you think in a Lynchian way very like so many other of his works. A flawless picture. 10/10. David Lynch is a very self-indulgent director, and one who obviously very closely and literally adheres to the basic precepts of the film maker's art. His "Blue Velvet" is yet another example of a very original, and some say quirky, perspective behind the lens. On the surface, this is just an appallingly bad film with disjointed imagery and great actors reduced to uttering sparse, wooden lines. Beneath the surface, however, Mr. Lynch is a master of visual composition and uses color and juxtaposition of positive and negative imagery to deeply influence the viewer. The film exudes a spare, off-kilter unrest, and the use of industrial sound throughout as a background, really gets across the underlying, disturbing and gritty feel of the sordid tale. Lynch's is an enchanted world, where beetles struggle in a subterranean clamor, and the shadow of a factory appears where there was none before to indicate an underlying malfeasance. Lynch uses literal image - quite starkly and almost ham-handedly to represent what many writer directors accomplish through spoken word - or failing that, the trite use of music. I find this homage to the visual criteria of film itself very honest. Each camera angle is perfect, each closeup is carefully thought out. Each scene is painted in oddly contrasting colors and shadow, exuding menace or anticipation or terror or sex or madness. And throughout, Dennis Hopper gives a tour de force interpretation as the spectacularly disturbed Frank Booth - truly a madman for the ages. Technically, an excellent film, but not very entertaining, nor easy to watch. Not for the squeamish. "You have to let me play Frank Booth, because I am Frank Booth" that was the "sales pitch" that Dennis Hopper used on Director David Lynch before he was cast in the role of his life in Blue Velvet. They originally had wanted Robert Loggia in the role of the helium sniffing, obscenity screaming villian in this film. Frank Booth is a mutant from hell, the epitome of our worst nightmare only one we cannot wake up from. He makes Loren Singer on JAG look like your dear mother. Think of your worst nightmare and then scream as loud as you can and that is Frank Booth. One critic called this film "the Hardy Boys go to hell". Kyle McLachin is wonderful as is Laura Dern, but they should have given my man Dennis the Oscar for his performance. He re-ignited a long stagnant career with this role and went on to make a whole new career as Hollywood's chief nut case isn't that wonderful. Dennis Hopper was born in Dodge City Kansas in 1936. He came to Hollywood in 1954 as a protege of James Dean. He was in Dean's films Rebel Without A Cause and Giant. He had a fight with Henry Hathaway on the set of From Hell To Texas. In two days and 100 takes he fought with him. This resulted in him being blacklisted from Hollywood. He took up painting and photography and did 140 tv shows before he did Easy Rider in 1969 with Peter Fonda. His next film, The Last Movie in 1971 was a bomb. He spent the next 14 years as a Hollywood exile. He did a few films like Tracks, Mad Dog Morgan, American Friend, Apocolypse Now and Out Of The Blue (which he also directed). However, his addictions took control of his life. He admitted he was doing 12 lines of cocaine, 28 beers and a gallon of rum a day before he finally went insane on a movie set, tore off his clothes and ran naked into the jungle. He finally cleaned himself up and made the most spectacular comeback in Hollywood history! He won raves for his role in Blue Velvet, an Oscar nomination for Hoosiers, he finally was able to direct a film called Colors that won critical esteem, he won an Emmy nomination for Paris Trout and Doublecrossed and was in the blockbuster hit Speed. Dennis Hopper is one of the most amazing survivors and actors and geniuses of our time. He is a man who went thru hell and came out the other edge. He walks a highwire thru hell in Blue Velvet and lets us hang onto our seats. American cinema is known for some great achievements, and maybe more so for cheap thrill, popcorn munching joyrides.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet", which should have won the best picture Oscar, and probably would have, had it followed "The Silence of the Lambs" to the voting table, falls into the "great achievements" category.  Lynch takes wholesome Americana visions of mom and apple pie and focuses in close-up to show us that sometimes the apples in that pie are rotten.<br/><br/>More importantly, this is a film that transcends style to become a hellishly realistic vision of Americans, and how we view and interact with the world around us.  We simultaneously fear and are fascinated by the dark elements of our society.  Jeffrey Beaumont does what others wont:  he steps clear of the tree-lined streets full of single-family homes built for nice people like him to explore the the monolithic apartment building on the corner, which contains stories both beautiful and grotesque.  Literally and figuratively, he becomes part of one of those stories, as Lynch transforms Jeffrey as the voyeur to the camera as voyeur.<br/><br/>The specifics of Jeffrey's adventure are irrelevant, and the plot seems an overblown version of the film noir mom is watching on TV.  What is important is Jeffrey dirtying himself in the hidden underbelly of the community he thought he knew, and how this changes him.  Isabella Rossellini is a Mrs. Robinson from hell, enmeshing her protege in things Benjamin Braddock would have never dreamed of.  Jeffrey's epiphany rivals that of Neo in "The Matrix":  while Neo can finally understand the feelings he's had all of his life because reality wasn't real, Jeffrey's reality and his happy-go-lucky demeanor are called into question violently.  He is forever changed not just by what he's seen, but by the new perceptions he has of reality, and the fact that what he has seen defies any explanation that would have been offered in his ordinary world.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is a constant source of debate for viewers.  Does it represent the removal of those rotten apples, or just the bliss of choosing to ignore them and dig in?  It's in the eye of the beholder, but either view can represent the same thing, depending on how badly the viewer wants to see this film world returned to its "normal" state.<br/><br/>Acting is dead-on for what Lynch wants to achieve.  The story is solid, and the direction is beyond reproach.  Some filming styles were considered experimental at the time, but are much more mainstream today (Fincher, etc.).  Nevertheless, they are used to great effect and their impact is not lost with time.<br/><br/>This film ranks with Hitchcock's "Vertigo" as an all-time classic example of American storytelling on film.  It is so much an American perspective, that I imagine that while not impossible for the rest of the world to appreciate, it is better understood by those of us who grew up in the Lumberton's of our country.<br/><br/>Must see. A beautiful white picket fence, surrounded by vibrant red flowers. The local fireman, a hero to all. Children happily and safely crossing the road. A big, white, two-story house, with a car in the garage. It is the American dream, the perfect life. Nothing can go wrong. Evil doesn't lurk here... Not in sleepy Lumberton, USA.<br/><br/>But David Lynch prefers to differ. In David's mind evil lurks behind that picket fence. Perverse people lie under the happy image purported by the small town. Sadness and depression reside over the joyful sound of children playing.<br/><br/>The nice-as-pie Jeffrey Beaumont stumbles upon a gruesome find in a back lot one day. A severed human ear. Who is it from? Who did it? And why? These questions lead clean-cut Jeffrey on a mysterious journey through perversity, sexual desire and the evil that lurks, just below the surface. The mystery leads Jeffrey to bar singer Dorothy Vallens (a wonderful Isabella Rossellini). There seems to be some mystery surrounding Dorothy, and Jeffrey is determined to solve the mystery, quite naive, really. And things are going to be made harder by the psychopathic Frank Booth, played with real menace by Dennis Hopper, who adds a severe amount of humour to the film, which really puts you off-kilter. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, and usually you end up bizarrely conflicted, laughing when you know you should be crying and crying when you should be laughing. Welcome to the world of David Lynch.<br/><br/>The writing is like a soap opera from another world. The cinematography is excellent and the sets are atmospheric are delicious. The background music is amazingly sinister. The acting is top notch and the film's little nuances are to die for, such as the man buying the axe, the creepy man with dog, the woman dancing on top of the car and the man driving the car shouting sexual advances to Sally, the daughter of the main police officer investigating the severed ear. And the quotble lines keep coming, "It's a strange world", "Now it's dark", "I don't know if you're a pervert or a detective."<br/><br/>The music, from Angelo Badalamenti, as always, is stunning and haunting. The song 'Mysteries of Love' is usual David Lynch fair, beautiful and ghostly.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that most David Lynch movies are weird. And while this is no different, it is certainly one of his more accessible films to audiences turned off by really confusing and bizarre films.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of modern filmmaking, and a trip into perversity that I adore taking.<br/><br/>9/10 Seeing "Blue Velvet" for the first time in 2003, one is struck by the thought of how amazing this film must have seemed when it came out in 1986. Lynch's theme, of a darkness that lies behind a surface of suburban tranquility, has since been regularly regurgitated, not least by Lynch himself who returned to the same territory, at greater length but to considerably less effect, in his self-indulgent television series "Twin Peaks".  Why, it is hard to tell, for "Blue Velvet" succeeds in delivering what "Twin Peaks" can only promise.<br/><br/>The story starts by announcing its oddness when Kyle MacLachlan discovers an ear. But the oddness is contained within a remarkable cinematic vision.  The skill with which Lynch conjures up atmospheres of wholesomeness and perversion is truly admirable.  Of note are his use of music and of silence; the magic quality he somehow imparts to the most banal of dialogue ("What beer is this?" "It's Heinekin". "I've never drunk Heinekin." "You've never drunk Heinekin?" "My Dad drinks Bud." "King of beers." - you really have to watch to understand); the fluorescent quality he imparts to whites of people's eyes.  As is his scene composition: in one amazing shot, Isabella Rosselini's cheekbone tesselates exactly with the curl of MaClachlan's bicep: an image of great (and oddly pure) beauty in this tale of squalid fetish. MacLachlan and Laura Dern, playing dead straight, are extraordinarily affecting; Rosselini conveys just the right blend of mystery and helplessness; and while Dennis Hopper plays (intentionally) over-the-top, his screen time is wisely limited, ensuring each appearance conveys a genuine menace.<br/><br/>This is not a deep film, its purpose artistic rather than moral; but it's haunting nonetheless.  Genuinely genre-bending (is this a horror flick? a detective story? a teen romance?), "Blue Velvet" is nonetheless Lynch's most coherent film.  Less self-consciously clever than "Mullholland Drive", it is arguably also still his best. I personally feel that David Lynch is a master when it comes to film.  This warped tour of suburban American proves it.  Great acting all the way around, especially Dennis Hopper.  Talk about creepy.  Yeah, there are some cheesy moments like the bird in the trees, and the ear in the field, but I think that David Lynch had ment for it to be that way.  This is a must see for any Lynch or Dennis Hopper fan.  9/10 "Blue Velvet" is an almost shockingly coherent entry from Lynch that follows a pretty straight forward mystery plot that unearths the seedy underbelly and inherent weirdness of small town America, although some Lynch fanatics will contend that as with all his films, some of what we see on screen is a dream.  Lynch played on this theme later to a larger extent with "Twin Peaks" and applied similar logic to big town Hollywood with his "Mulholland Drive" opus.  There's plenty of disturbing stuff here.  Dennis Hopper is one of the creepiest villains ever as masochist Frank Booth, and the sight of Dean Stockwell lip-synching to "In Dreams" while in drag and drugged up is certainly nightmarish.  The set design, cinematography, score, and acting are all top notch here and even more impressive considering the limited budget.  Many contend this is Lynch's greatest film, but I think only time will tell.  As with his other great works of art, it does seem to be working towards the greater cause of revealing something profound about the human condition, and does it in a bizarrely beautiful way.  There is good in this world, Lynch seems to be telling us, but often it gets lost in s**t. I loved Mulholland Drive and after seeing all the write-ups on Blue Velvet, finding it on best movies lists, etc. etc. I really was expecting a lot.  I liked Blue Velvet, but I doubt if I'll ever watch it again (by contrast, I've seen Mulholland Drive 5 or 6 times).  So obviously, I don't think it's Lynch's best.  In fact, it's my least favorite of the 4 films I've seen by him (behind Mulholland Drive, The Straight Story and Lost Highway). 'Blue Velvet' was the movie that got me hooked on David Lynch. I went to see it at my local small town cinema when it was first released and was totally blown away! I had already seen 'The Elephant Man' by then, but I don't think I had yet seen 'Eraserhead'. Knowing very little about the movie I was quite unprepared for what a twisted and fascinating experience I was in for! Like most of Lynch's movies, the cinematography is superb, and the movie really must be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate it. The famous shot towards the very beginning of the movie where the camera pans down to the Beaumont's lawn and we see the hidden world underneath the grass makes an unforgettable impact that has the viewer hooked immediately, and foreshadows what is to come, and to me the movie continues to fascinate until the very end. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are well cast as the small town "nice" kids who find themselves caught up in a mysterious and dangerous scene that exists right under their noses. Dennis Hopper ('Easy Rider'), long a legendary cult figure, is given one of the most memorable roles of his career as Frank Booth, still one of the most repellent movie villains ever seen. Hopper was newly sober, and had spent a long time in "exile" from Hollywood, and with 'Blue Velvet' he could not have asked for a more amazing opportunity for a comeback. Hopper OWNS the screen every time we see him, and the much discussed "candy colored clown" sequence between him and his old friend Dean Stockwell ('Psych-Out') is one of the high points of 1980s cinema. Watching that for the first time, not knowing what was about to happen, was truly remarkable. When Stockwell bursts into song (lip-synching the late, great Roy Orbison) it is impossible to describe the electrifying feeling in the cinema! A stunning movie moment that I have rarely felt since. The "Sister Christian/fire-cracker" sequence in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' over ten years later was the closest I can recall to recapturing the tension and insane feel of "this CANNOT be happening!". Hopper and Stockwell are well supported by Lynch regular Jack Nance ('Eraserhead's Henry), and the wonderful Brad Dourif ('Wise Blood'). A creepier collection of low-life hoods it is hard to imagine. The other great performance in the movie is by Isabella Rossellini, who is very brave and honest in a very controversial role. 'Blue Velvet'  to me ties with 'Lost Highway' as David Lynch's most impressive and satisfying achievement, and is still one of the most original and exciting movies of the 1980s. An indisputable modern classic that should be watched by every movie lover. Don't miss this one! The film starts with a montage of a friendly suburban area of Deep River. People smile, grasses are green. A man is watering his yard. The man falls to the ground, clenching his neck and it's never explained what happens to him. And from here...<br/><br/>His son, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) finds an ear and goes to see Detective Williams (George Dickerson) who lives near him, and as he leaves the house he meets Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), the detective's daughter, who he convinces to come with him to Dorothy Vallen's (Isabella Rossellini) house, a singer,  that Sandy has just told him about. There's a man, Frank Booth, (Dennis Hopper) who inhales a mysterious substance as he beats up Dorothy and then there's the man in yellow and the well-dressed man. There's also Paul (his name's Paul).<br/><br/>When Sandy picks up Jeffrey so that he can tell her about the night before, and they park across from a church with the organ inside playing music we can hear in the background, and Jeffrey tells her about last night and Sandy tells him about a dream she had -- the lack of robins resulting in no light -- we get a strange feeling that this movie is something more than just style. When a man looks into a lunch bag and says, "that's a human ear, alright," we don't know whether to be shocked or amused, or both.<br/><br/>There are some bugs and some curtains, some velvet and a few meetings at diners. There's drugs, shootings, men wearing makeup. There's a young couple dancing, a woman dancing on a car and a man singing into a utility light. There aren't any midgets, but there is a woman that wears a wig and a man without an ear. <br/><br/>Yet for all that, it's not a very weird movie. Once it gets its hold on us and we're fully within the movie's world, this all seems completely rational, if never seeming completely safe. There were moments in the film where I was moved -- when an old woman notices a bird on a ledge or when a psychopathic, sadistic murderer is stroking material he clenches in his hand, as he watches the object of his desire (I didn't say I was always moved in a good way).<br/><br/>Someone said that in the Reagan era of the 80's we needed a movie like "Blue Velvet" to come along and show what's festering below the surface of America. That's probably one of the reasons the movie was made, and that theme holds up well, but what makes me adore this movie isn't the issues that it deals with (if indeed it deals with any), but HOW it deals with them. The film is so CINEMATIC that it demands attention. Even still, after all the cheap Lynchian imitations, "Blue Velvet" remains one of the most unique, sick, imperfect, sexy, boring, fascinating, romantic, hilarious and horrifying of all movies.<br/><br/>It's also a masterwork.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>Note: Watch this movie and compare it to "American Beauty." Lynch is interested in his characters and isn't full of contempt and superior snobbery. He isn't just showing the "gee whiz" Americana simply to underscore the sordidness, he shows it because he's just as interested in the ordinary folk as he is of anything else. Don't believe the Lynch detractors; Lynch may be selling imperfection, but he does it with genuine feeling and interest. To paraphrase a frizzy-haired man, he's not just letting other people get his kicks for him. Before this movie I'm afraid to say i had never seen a David Lynch movie, but after this I have to say that I would like to see a whole load more from where this came from.<br/><br/>If you thought American Beauty showed a gratuitously seedy view of American suburbia, then don't watch this movie as this film makes Mendes' masterpiece look like Beauty and the Beast. Sado-masochistic sex, drug abuse (of a sort), violence and Dennis Hopper's evil Frank Booth make this movie a little strong for some tastes but these contraversial aspects of the movie make it even more interesting. Lynch handles the darker side of the film brilliantly and does not resort to the kind of film making that titillates the viewer with the movie's content, more of the kind of film making that shocks them.<br/><br/>The characters are painted in shades of grey and not the polarized black and white of good and evil you seem to get in some Hollywood movies. For example some empathy can be found through the "villain" of the piece- the savage Frank Booth- who is show to love and care, like Kyle Machlachan's character albeit in an odd kind of way.<br/><br/>Shocking, highly disturbing and moving- this is a tour de force of film making and should be up there with the best movies of the 1980s. I can't understand that someone visiting this site just called this film a piece of garbage. (!) Maybe you should stick to the American Pie film site or at least leave the criticism to people that see a little further. Not that I noticed everything that is special in this film, but I saw it for the first time just a month ago and I was very impressed. The story of a young man who enters a world of violence and misery through his discovery of an ear makes a unique story. The dialogue is absolutely remarkably Lynch's and puts the viewer in a position to wonder over the absurd world all around the characters. After the movie, you might not understand all of it, but just remind yourself that this is a movie that indirectly adresses the underlying fears and anxieties of men and women. You could call it a cult film, as many have, but it's absolutely fun to watch if you're not bored too easily, like many impatient filmgoers. "It's a strange world" Indeed. Not that it should mean anything to you, but this is probably my favorite film.  The opening and closing bookends bring a big stupid grin to my face every time.<br/><br/>When recommending this film to friends who have seen Lost Highway, a major concern seems to be that Blue Velvet might be similarly obtuse, abstract Lynchian style without plot. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The plot here is primary and the cinematic style is a wildly creative slave to it.  This film is the most satisfyingly warped prototypical Mid-American myth ever put on celluloid, a dark and disturbing hero's journey wrapped in super-saturated commentary on the thin candy-coated shell of small town America.  It is structurally brilliant and visually perfect.  Film students need to see it. Writers need to see it.  Everybody needs to see it.<br/><br/>The opening shots of beautiful small town Lumberton are perfectly idyllic. They are not photorealistic, they are a heightened, supersaturated, mythically perfect Platonic ideal of "small town."  It is the American myth we have created for ourselves, what we aspire to, what we in denial convince ourselves we live in.  With an amazing economy of images, the tensions build, the dream twists and the terrible threatening nature of our mundane surroundings breaks through.  The facade breaks down.  Mr. Beaumont's body betrays him. His toy dog is a ferocious and unsympathetic animal.  We dive down through the supernaturally green grass, through the veneer, through the lookingglass, and down into the ground where the insects have lurked all along.  We and our hero Jeffrey Beaumont wallow in this darkness through the rest of the film as he dives into the middle of a wonderfully satisfying Lynch-noir mystery.<br/><br/>The film's cinematic style follows this dive through the facade. Cinematography and acting remain highly stylized, but grow much more visceral and immediate as Jeffrey progresses towards the truth.  Less stilted, more traditionally believable.  Jeffrey is bound less and less by awkwardly-delivered, socially prescribed scripts for human interaction. In this dark underworld there isn't time for them.  He acts and reacts freely.  His veneer is stripped away, though he readopts it for brief visits to the surface world.  This duality, the maintenance of the daytime illusion of surfaceworld Lumberton, makes it all the more disturbing when darkness does creep in.  When he breaks down in his bedroom, when Yellow Man shows up in safe places, when Dorothy appears on his doorstep, the insects are welling up through the candy-coated shell.<br/><br/>Hopper, of course, is scary as hell.  A mythically huge monster that breathes its own atmosphere.  Twisted knots of psychosis funneled into a barking demon of rage that transcends human form.  The single most frightening believable movie villain ever constructed.<br/><br/>I refuse to discuss this any further.  Blue Velvet is a film that should be discovered on its own terms, but know that it is deep and intricate and worth repeated study. It is dark and shiny and beautiful.  Fascinating in its evil.  It is a film of vast dry wit where Light and Love reveal themselves as synthetic robots.  And they eat bugs.<br/><br/>"Yes, that's a human ear alright." Interpretation, spoilers:<br/><br/>From the beginning scene with the friendly fireman and bright red roses juxtaposed against a white picket fence backdrop, it is established that the movie will explore the cliched world of overly-optimistic suburbia.<br/><br/>
Jeffrey and Sandy represent optimism in humanity, while Jack and his barbarous crew represent the negative side of humanity. This polarity is epitomized in Jeffrey's plaintive query, "Why are there people like Jack?" and Sandy's ridiculously but purposely trite interpretation of her robin dream.  <br/><br/>These two examples seem corny. They are meant to be. By voicing their concerns in a condescending way, the audience learns of Lynch's attitude towards their position. <br/><br/>In the end, this triteness is exaggerated to the extreme. Jeffrey's father miraculously heals; all the bad guys are gunned down; Jeffrey and Sandy realize their love for each other; and Dorothy is saved from an abusive relationship. <br/><br/>The audience infers that this ending is satiric from the fact that this optimistic ending is not developed and according to the flow of the movie, Jack and his entourage should have emerged victorious. Also, there is the marked un-serious acting (regarding the optimistic pole) of scenes which would require much seriousness if the movie were meant to be completely serious.<br/><br/>Both the cause and cure of Jeffrey's father's illness are never revealed; his recovery is all that is needed in a happy movie. All the bad guys are easily conquered despite their seemingly omnipotent characterizations and infiltration of the police. Jeffrey and Sandy's underdeveloped relationship suddenly turns to the love expected in a happy film. Dorothy is seemingly saved from Jack; but in reality she had enjoyed his abuse and pleaded with Jeffrey to be more like Jack. She is not even slightly saddened after the torture and death of her husband. What a happy ending. <br/><br/>
An excellent satire of the typical good-conquers-evil cinematic schema. Overall, an excellent mystery movie and a pretty good Lynch movie; though I would have preferred a little more Lost Highway or Eraserhead-like depth and symbolism. Blue Velvet is definitely more humorous though, if you have the right frame of mind when watching it and are not overly conservative. This is a great film. I have seen it numerous times, and it still never fails to shock me. Dennis Hopper plays one of the great villains ever (how he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this film is beyond me). I love the dreamy,surreal quality it has, especially the scene at Ben's where he lip-synchs Roy Orbison's "In Dreams"(which fits perfectly into this film). All in all, Lynch's best work to date. One more thing, how did Roger Ebert give this movie only one star? He and his partner don't seem to appreciate David Lynch movies too much. Oh well,that's their loss. Gee, where to begin. This surely is a complex movie. It seems to make people react very extremely. And I can understand why.The problem with this movie is, that it needs a lot of ironic distance to be appreciated. If you watch it as you watch an ordinary hollywood blockbuster, you'll miss the point. Not that I pretend to understand it, but i'll try to explain.<br/><br/>Blue velvet was made directly after the fiasco called DUNE, de laurentiis wanted to recuperate some of his lost money, so it seems that Blue velvet was made on a low budget. There are no outrageous special effects, just good acting and a weird story.<br/><br/>Some people comment on the discrepancy between the almost animalistic acting of Hopper and rosselini, and the style of playing of the others. This is correct, but one must keep in mind that Dern and Mc Clachlan are in fact acting as strong as Hopper and Rosselini. They play little kids trapped in an adolescent body. Jeffry is a real boyscout with his low-budget spy-cam, trying to look tough with his one earring. Hopper and Rosselini are two children as well, but they are caught up in violence and sex-games. They really don't differ from the sandy and Jeffry character, they just act tough.<br/><br/>That is why the viewer has to keep enough distance from the movie. It's not a detective, it's not a comedy, it's not a gangstermovie or an erotic picture, it's pure Lynch. That is why the normal analysing strategies fail. It's humor doesn't come from the first level, the absurd situation, but from the clash of styles within the movie.<br/><br/>That is why the movie has to be watched several times before it can be understood completely. It is not the best movie I ever saw, but it sure gave me a boost. That is why I suggest those who didn't like it to give it a second chance. And this time, pay attention! This film is the quintessential David Lynch film. It represents his greatest big-screen work before he started getting a little too self-aware.<br/><br/>
Dennis Hopper plays a role that is possibly one of the scariest people in film history. (I know, I know ... lots of arguments there, but I was really scared of him.) The casting, acting, and script are brilliant. I give it a 9. This is my all-time favourtie move. Everything in "Blue Velvet" simply gels together prefectly. This is the first film in which I discovered the concept of subtext. Even now, every time I see the movie, I see something new, some little quirk or characteristic that can illuminate the film in a completely different light.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" can also mess with your head in a big way. Someone once asked me  what the scariest thing that I had ever seen in a movie was. I didn't even have to think about the answer. Dennis Hopper in "Blue Velvet". This is the closest that I've ever seen an actor come to portraying complete, irreversible evil on screen. I still get chills thinking about the sequence in which Frank and his gang have got Jeffery out in the middle of nowhere, "In Dreams" playing and Frank completely going ballistic at Jeffery.<br/><br/>However, the film can mess with you in ways that, upon first viewing, you're not even aware of. This is the film that revealed one of Lynch's major gifts as a director; the way that he can take an existing song and, using it with a particular image, can twist it's meaning inside out. This is a film that deals with many different types of perversion. The way that Lynch uses "Love Letter" during the raid on Frank's apartment like a musical riff on what Frank had said to Jeffery earlier cements Lynch's place as one of the greatest directors cinema has had the pleasure to have known.<br/><br/>Like "Eraserhead", I liked this film when I first saw it, but something about it drew me back for repeated viewings. I gradually discovered, like "Eraserhead", layers and levels that weren't immediately apparent. This film pretty much introduced me to a completely different way of looking at cinema, beyond that of a mere form of entertainment.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen "Blue Velvet", I urge you to do so.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"It's a strange world". I am very undecided whenever I think of considering David Lynch a really good director. I thought Eraserhead and Blue Velvet were really great films, and Lost Highway was a little too out there, but Wild at Heart was terrible. I have yet to see Twin Peaks and some of his others, but I dont really care, this is about Blue Velvet, and Blue Velvet is a phenomenol movie. It is so obscure and funny, and scary, and enticing. Lynch outdid himself with this one; I just love movies where your body is tingling after they conclude. This movie is not really violent enough. From the start of the film, when the little boy finds the dried apricot with the ants crawling all over it, until the final bloody scene, there is nowhere near enough violence. When will movie-makers stop pandering to the squeamishness of today's audiences? And what is the deal with that dried apricot anyway? But having said that, this is a film you must watch. Get it out on video and watch it three times a day for a week. I did, and there's nothing wrong with me! After that, try watching it on tv. The tv version is HILARIOUS! They replace all the swearing with "freak". So one of Frank's lines comes out as: "YOU FREAK! YOU FREAKIN' FREAK! YOU WANNA FREAK? FRANKY LIKES TO FREAK! YOU GET A LOVE LETTER FROM FRANKY AND YOU'RE FREAKED!" Watch it with your whole family, maybe at Christmas time so that you don't have to watch "Ben Hur", AGAIN! After 21 years, I've finally seen David Lynch's masterpiece, Blue Velvet. The director seems to purposely start the movie like a bland '50s-like film setting as depicted in any domestic drama that came out at the time before we dolly to some insects and an old man injuring himself while hosing a garden. That man is the father of Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan). As he comes back to take care of his father, he becomes friendly with girl-next-door Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), whose father is the police detective investigating the case. Other great performances include Isabella Rossellini as the masochistic Dorothy Vallens, Dean Stockwell as the Roy Orbison-loving Ben, and, best of all, Dennis Hopper as the psychopathic Frank Booth who's the only character who loves saying the f-word. Lynch keeps things going between blandness and intensity so much that you wonder what kind of environment he grew up in. Whatever it was, we're all the better in him sharing his vision with us. While I found Twin Peaks and Mulholland Dr. a bit confusing, Blue Velvet makes sense almost all the way through. Still, Lynch is one of the most unique filmmakers of the late 20th century and we're all the better for it! Blue velvet is a strange film about middle America and what goes on behind it's seedy closed doors. All i can say is maybe i wasn't in tune with this film because i could not understand what David Lynch , the Director was trying to say.Dennis hopper is just.....well , Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern is poor and Kile Maclachlan is ok in this film. Only Isabella Rossellini comes out of this with any credit.Unless you really are pushed for something to do for two hours , don't bother. 5 out of 10 And I just couldn't take it anymore. This was my third attempt at this film and the furthest I got. I love a good weird, arty film with a twist but this is just so insufferably bad I literally couldn't concentrate long enough to get anything meaningful from it. How anyone can give this steaming pile of Arthouse wank a 10 is beyond me. David Lynch is a go-to director for surreal and weird. I recall seeing another of his films back in the late eighties / early nineties at the Cinema; that didn't make much sense either.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the central charter (Kyle MC) and his relationships with a night club singer (Isabella R) and high school age daughter (Laura D) of the detective tasked with finding the recipient of the ear. The nightclub singer is enslaved to a psycho (Dennis H) who holds her son. There is a section during the film where the character played by Laura D delivers a monologue about darkness and Robin's (the avian types). I interpret this as a metaphor where Kyle McC's character is moving from darkness to light. I'm probably wrong!<br/><br/>All in all, there are sterling performances from the actors, but the story has a level of incoherence to one (like me) not prepared to deconstruct each scene to interpret the film. Very much the "atmosphere" from Twin Peaks. The plot is just so weird though - maybe too artistic for me. I liked some parts, but was really put off by some one dimensional characters (Frank's goons were comical, Frank was mad but completely unbelievable and Sandy was the vacuous and dreamy young girl). Dorothy was a complete mystery and yet her character was never explained. Jeffery seemed to have some character development in the car scene, but it was fleeting and then he reverted back to his old character. None of this was the cinematic genius I was hoping for. <br/><br/>If you want a film that says that rural suburbia has a dark underbelly, try Hot Fuzz. It's not an intellectual film, yet explores that concept just as well as Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film, but there's only so many stars I can give for an unexpected grass scene. There seems to be all kind of misdirection in this story, as things you expect to happen never come to pass. For example, I expected Detective Williams (George Dickerson) to be just as much a corrupt cop in the story as the Yellow Man/Detective Gordon (Fred Pickler) turned out to be. And when Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) came up with his theory that Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) kidnapped Dorothy Vallens' (Isabella Rossellini) husband and son, I thought that was just so unlikely that I dismissed the idea out of hand. Turns out both of those assumptions were pretty much blown to bits as things came to pass.<br/><br/>For a weirdly strange film with a lot going on, I thought the story was relatively easy to follow if one isn't distracted by the slick filming and Dorothy's bizarre behavior. No stranger to odd roles, Dennis Hopper excels at being a villain, just check him out in such diverse characterizations as "Mad Dog Morgan" and "Kid Blue" in completely different film genres. One hint offered by the script that Frank Booth actually DID cut off the ear of Dorothy's husband was when he remarked "Do it for van Gogh". At that point I had to reconsider my earlier reservations about just how accurate Jeffrey's assumptions would turn out to be.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the picture - Dean Stockwell lip-synching an old Roy Orbison tune 'In Dreams'. It almost looked like Stockwell was camping it up for real except that the voice was distinctively Orbison. The only real question I'd have about the entire picture was the one that set in motion the entire misadventure. How did Dorothy's husband's ear ever wind up in the open field in the first place? I've always contended that David's Lynch writes most of his scripts after he has awakened from bad dreams. This is the story of a nice young guy who has pretty much all he could want. One day, he makes the mistake of his life, getting involved with an older woman (Isabella Rosellini) and all the fallout from that almost destroys him. Soon he is in the hands of some of the most eccentric and dangerous people we could ever meet. Mainly, Dennis Hopper, a psychotic, who has a claim on the woman. Soon the boy's life is not his own and he can't seem to escape. The world he is in is the total opposite of the one he had but a few weeks before. So much has already been written about this film. I will only say that Hopper is one of the most threatening presences I have ever witnessed. As I watched this film the first time, I had all I could do to stay in the theater. There's an overriding sickness here where we want to grab this kid and move him to another continent to get him away; but we feel we still have to watch. In Blue Velvet, David Lynch focuses his attention on small town life, and the picture that emerges is not a pretty one.<br/><br/>Behind the picket fences and manicured front lawns lurk dark recesses of the human psyche. We have had clues that all was not well for some time. However, "Kings Row", "Peyton Place" and "Shadow of a Doubt" just skimmed the surface. Where Hitchcock could just peak through the windows, Lynch bursts through them, but do we really want him to?<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan's character, Jeffrey Beaumont, lives in a picturesque town called Brentwood. Jeffrey finds a severed ear on a vacant lot and takes it to a detective whose daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern), is a school friend. Sandy later tells him about a woman her father claims is involved in criminal activity – Dorothy Vallens – Isabella Rossellini's character. With reasoning too bizarre to question, Jeffrey enlists Sandy's help to sneak into Dorothy's apartment. <br/><br/>Although Dorothy discovers Jeffrey, she hides him in a closet when Dennis Hopper's character, Frank, turns up. Jeffery watches as Frank abuses Dorothy physically and emotionally. Jeffrey realises that Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and daughter, and that it was her husband's ear that he had discovered. When Frank leaves, Dorothy seduces Jeffrey and wants him to hurt her.<br/><br/>Frank kidnaps Jeffery when he finds him with Dorothy. Jeffery is humiliated and beaten badly in yet another sadomasochistic encounter. Following more abuse at Frank's hands, Dorothy suffers an emotional breakdown, precipitating the climax of the movie when everything is more or less resolved.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note the homage to other films contained in "Blue Velvet". Hitchcock's "Rear Window" is the most obvious reference. Jeffrey in the closet is very close to Jimmy Stewart's "Jeff" Jefferies peering out the window of his apartment – not to mention the similarity in the names. <br/><br/>Hopper projects a very bizarre character. His performance is way over-the-top, but also pivotal. For every scene of mundane, predictable small town life – parties, dating, football training, campus life – we are given the excesses of the Hopper character with his Amyl-Nitrate sniffing, violence and fetish-driven sex.<br/><br/>In fact, the way the contrasting scenes in Blue Velvet are juxtaposed, it's about as incongruous as introducing a serial killer into an episode of "Friends". <br/><br/>Lynch also asks Isabella Rosselini to do things that make you want to shout out, "Excuse me David, but that happens to be Ingrid Bergman's daughter, show a little respect please". Shock value and bad taste are two sides of the same coin in "Blue Velvet".<br/><br/>Of course there are brilliant touches in "Blue Velvet", however it also seems strangely empty. After all, the only point the film seems to make is that everything is not as it appears on the surface. A not wholly original observation pounded home with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. After his father is felled by a freak gardening incident, hunky clean-cut Kyle MacLachlan (Jeffrey Beaumont) returns home from college. Upon visiting his hospitalized father, Mr. MacLachlan makes a startling discovery. Walking home, he discovers a human ear in a grassy field. He takes the ear to lawman George Dickerson (as John Williams) at the local police station. The detectives confirm it is a serious matter, and advise MacLachlan to let the police handle the investigation. But, MacLachlan is curious <br/><br/>After learning about a lead involving the mysterious and alluring Isabella Rossellini (as Dorothy Vallens), MacLachlan discounts what curiosity did for the cat, and decides to investigate the crime for himself. "I'm just real curious," MacLachlan tells Mr. Williams. Meanwhile, MacLachlan has returned to work at the "Lumberton" town's hardware store, and begins dating Williams' high school-aged daughter. The pretty-in-pink, and mature, Laura Dern (as Sandy) helps MacLachlan into Ms. Rossellini's apartment.<br/><br/>In director David Lynch's world, this is akin to opening "Pandora's box". MacLachlan discovers Rossellini is a masochist, and he may be a closet sadist. Not only that, Rossellini comes with a foul-mouthed and ill-tempered lover, Dennis Hopper (as Frank Booth). Somehow, Lynch links this all up with the severed human ear MacLachlan found, and delivered to the police. That's one of the reasons "Blue Velvet" is prime Lynch - it all adds up to something, and can't be canceled before loose ends are tied up (see "Twin Peaks.").<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is quintessential, quirky, and commercially viable Lynch - unlike, say "Eraserhead" (1977). Lynch, his great cinematographer Frederick Elmes, the cast, and crew are frighteningly amazing. The only bad note is not seeing Dean Stockwell lip-synch all of Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" (1963). On the surface, it may be a Bobby Vinton (original singer of the 1963 title song) world. But, Lynch wants you to know there are some things hidden underneath; under the ground and beneath the human psyche, they lurk. <br/><br/>Still do.<br/><br/>********** Blue Velvet (8/86) David Lynch ~ Kyle MacLachlan , Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern Yes, the director got some fine work out of the actors, and the cinematography is quite good. Some of the misdirection was done well, also.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 5 because of the story. Far too many questions are raised than are answered. I'm okay with small things being left to the viewer's imagination - like how Frank is connected to the crooked cop, or just what Frank's motivation could possibly be - I can take such questions unanswered. But some of the main plot points revolve around mysteries that are never explained, or even hinted at.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers below *** Major points left unaddressed in this film include: Why was Frank willing to kidnap Dorothy's husband and child just to have rough sex with her? Why in the world would she allow a situation like that to continue without calling the cops? Especially after Frank starts mutilating her husband? She can't think it's going to end well without help.<br/><br/>How did Dorothy's husband's ear end up in the field? I can't imagine Dorothy simply throwing it away like that.<br/><br/>I know several sexual submissives and masochists. None of them would have behaved as Dorothy did.<br/><br/>Why did Dorothy show up at Jeffrey's house au natural? I'm not gonna ask how she knew where it was, or how she got across town in the buff without being noticed - but some explanation of why she'd do such a thing is almost essential.<br/><br/>Why does Frank decide to kill everyone at the end? His partner the bad cop, Dorothy's husband - what made him decide to go down and take as many as he could with him just then? Interesting story, told interestingly - but the motives for so many important events in the tale remain mysteries, making it really difficult to claim I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Frankly, when the end credits rolled, I felt cheated. "Blue Velvet" is a stunning 1986 film by director David Lynch that focuses on Jeffrey (Kyle McLachlan), a small-town college student who stumbles across a severed human ear in a field. He brings the ear to a local policeman, and slowly begins to fall for his daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern). But when the severed ear is linked to a nightclub singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), Jeffrey ends up drawn into Dorothy's bizarre world - a world where she is sexually controlled and manipulated by a delusion, violent sociopath, Frank (Dennis Hopper), and his life begins to turn upside down.<br/><br/>Probably David Lynch's most popular film, "Blue Velvet" is a bizarre but rewarding movie that has evolved into a cult classic over the years, and quite understandably. The first Lynch film I saw was 2006's "Inland Empire" (which also starred Laura Dern, this time in the leading role), and it was a very bizarre film that was not easy to make sense of. Not that I didn't like it, it was visually amazing and genuinely scary - it was just extremely hard to follow. Unlike many of Lynch's other films, "Blue Velvet" follows a linear storyline and is easy to keep up with, which is nice I suppose, if you aren't in the mood to try and put together a jigsaw puzzle (if you are however, I'd recommend seeing Lynch's "Inland Empire" or "Mullholland Drive", both of which are films that require repeat viewings to fully comprehend).<br/><br/>Lynch wrote the screenplay for this movie, and the script here is very solid. The cinematography and overall style though is what is the most striking thing about the movie, aside from the initially odd storyline. The colors, imagery, and visuals in this movie are often extremely beautiful, really quite eerie, or a strange but potent blend of both. Speaking of mixtures, "Blue Velvet" also manages to blend genres successfully, almost to the point where it can't be labeled. It contains a myriad of genre elements: the emotion of a drama; the suspense of a mystery; the eeriness of a horror; and the sexuality of a romance. Lynch mixes all these ingredients together, and the film turns out to be one unusual, often disturbing, but enjoyable experience. I'd also like to mention the music, which is so wonderfully fitting. The entire film almost seems like one large suburbian fairytale, and the overall style is great.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are very much worth noting. Kyle McLachlan is likable as the leading man who carries the story, and Isabella Rossellini is excellent as the innocent, beautiful nightclub singer that is the focus of Jeffrey and Frank's sexual releases. The Frank character himself is played by Dennis Hopper, who can manage to convey the over-the-top nature of the character, as well as the more realistic side to him, and he does it well. Also worth watching is a younger Laura Dern (pre-"Jurassic Park") playing Jeffrey's love interest as well as an assistance into the mystery revolving around Dorothy Vallens. She's always a pleasure to watch and doesn't let down here either. Something I'd like to bring up before ending my review also would be the ending of the movie- it's surprisingly uplifting and optimistic, especially for being a David Lynch movie, and I really did like seeing that because it really fit the movie well.<br/><br/>Overall, "Blue Velvet" is a one-of-a-kind movie, and I can really say that with sincerity. It's something that you'll never see anything quite like. It's intense and disturbing, but also hypnotic and beautiful, sometimes being both at the same time, evoking the feel of a bizarre fairytale. It truly is a cult classic, and I think it's safe to say that it's a classic of cinema in general, because of its strong originality and vivid imagery. Well worth seeing, and a movie that you're not likely to ever really forget. 10/10. Blue Velvet is an extraordinary and influential masterpiece that centers corruption. It is a thriller/drama that explores the dark side of America, and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Young Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is on the brink of manhood in Lumberton 1986David Lynch's mise-en-scène is also readying to leave its "Leave it to Beaver" façade behind. In a town overwhelmed by bright white picket fences, blood red fire trucks, and carefully pruned roses, there's something especially grotesque about a man having a heart attack on his front lawn while his cocker spaniel laps spraying water from the hose still clinging to his hand.However, while we are presented with these strikingly beautiful images of Lumberton, the viewer seems to wait for something bizarre and out of the ordinary to happen. There is something that screams "nothing is what it seems".<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is David Lynch in peak form, and represents (to date) his most accomplished motion picture. It is a work of fascinating scope and power that rivals any of the most subversive films to reach the screens during the '80s. For Lynch, the sometimes-auteur, sometimes-illusionist, Blue Velvet was the movie that cemented his credentials as a filmmaker in a way that none of his previous efforts were able to. When pundits refer to something as "Lynchian," they are typically referencing the themes and stylistic approach that is on display in this movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is not what it initially appears to be, although there is a clue early in the film where Lynch is heading. Blue Velvet opens with images exported from the American Dream: perfect little houses with white picket fences and impeccably manicured yards. A man collapses while watering his lawn, and the camera, after following him to the ground, burrows into it, parting the blades of grass to reveal a colony of swarming bugs. The message is clear  perfection often hides deeply-rooted rot. Dreams can easily turn into nightmares. Corruption is everywhere, even in places that seem immune to it. These themes, and others about the pernicious influence of evil, are explored in some depth throughout Blue Velvet. Blue Velvet is a stunning work of art and something so influential it has basically redefined the entire meaning of cinema. Its influence can be seen in films as diverse as Happiness and American Beauty, and TV shows such as Desperate Housewives and The X-Files. It happily welcomed sex taboo and violence into the Hollywood mainstream due to its success. A pure masterpiece, and one of the greatest films ever made. Stunning surreal bizarre but an AMAZING film in all aspects this is perhaps one of the weirdest movies i have ever seen but that is to be expected when David Lynch directs a movie but i would like to see more of his work now after seeing in this. Okay you may ask will it take more then one viewing to appreciate it? well that depends on your tastes if you don't like David Lynch STAY AWAY from this if you do like David Lynch by all means rush to the video store and buy it or rent it it has a fascinating story that is gripping all the way and never lets go. i dug the love story between Sandy and Jeffrey as well. I liked every single character in this movie they all played the parts Perfectly right on target. there isn't much gore but lots of disturbing stuff we get an ear found in the grass with bugs nibbling on it we get a couple dead people standing with no ears and blood all over there upper body area we get a gory head shot with blood and brains splattering and there is a couple more disturbing bits. The Acting is Oscar Worthy in my opinion. Dennis Hopper gives an OUTSTANDING performance here this guy plays a crazy man exceptionally he made me laugh and and also gave me the creeps at times too what a wonderful delightful performance he gave. Kyle MacLachlan is also OUTSTANDING here i don't know what happened to him but he had the talent to be a star in my opinion and he showed it here showing vulnerability and fear i LOVED him.Laura Dern was my favorite character here this woman is EXTREMELY GORGEOUS!!!! and a VERY good actress all GREAT job! 3 of these people i just mentioned deserved Oscar consideration in my opinion. she also had great chemistry with Kyle.Isabella Rossellini is VERY good here and i felt very sorry for her character and she did a great job here. Hope Lange does what she has to do well. as Sandy's mother.Dean Stockwell is good here in his limited screen time.George Dickerson is great as the detective i liked him lots. Brad Douriff has a killer laugh and he cracked me up here. Overall a AMAZING experience and a wonderful film SEE THIS IMMEDIATELY!!! ***** out of 5 David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is almost impossible to describe because the actors are so great portraying their roles that reviewing this film might create an anti-climax. Though, we immediately recognize David Lynch's touch, his obsession for the bizarre and the cruel. The film has a pulp simplicity, but it's self-conscious in its satire. Isabella Rossellini portrays a woman whose husband and son have been kidnapped by Dennis Hopper, and Kyle McLaghlan and Laura Dern are the heroes who try to discover what's behind the small town facade. They whisper corny lines to each other and their characters are purely mechanical; but there are times when they let themselves go and almost pull out from the unidimensional behavior of the characters. Dennis Hopper gives a strong performance as an obsessed and dangerous man, with a homicidal sexual behavior.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" could be better if only Lynch knew how to develop real characters instead of throwing at us the same old pessimistic satire and mechanical behavior for two hours. I worked as an atmosphere person in this film when it was being shot in Wilmington, North Carolina. (The real Lumberton is about 70 miles away.) I'd never seen any of Lynch's work nor heard of most of the principal actors. But I'll never forget the first evening I showed up for work at the Slow Club -- actually, The Mad Monk, now demolished. We were handed a synopsis of the plot. I read it goggle-eyed. "A young man who's father has had a stroke finds a human ear in a vacant lot." <br/><br/>The story made no sense whatever. I was left with the impression that, My God, this is going to be truly a silly piece of garbage with an unfollowable narrative and lots of gore and will go directly to video and no one will watch it. <br/><br/>Nothing that happened during the next straight 18 hours of shooting, or the several days following, changed my mind. Lynch looked wrecked, as if he'd been awake for 18 days, never mind hours. Isabella Rosselini was stunningly beautiful but couldn't sing. The shooting that first night and the next day seemed to go on forever and Lynch seemed out of control, with a dozen extras collecting overtime and trying desperately to keep awake in the courtyard while he did tight shots inside the club. <br/><br/>Eighteen hours of listening over and over to the classic recording of "Blue Velvet" played at top volume. I heard it in nightmares for months afterwards, and I still can't hear it without getting an acidic flashback to 1986 in which everyone is shivering, wondering what's going on, and utterly stupefied by fatigue.<br/><br/>The experience left me completely unprepared for what I saw on the screen when the film was released. The ragtag non sequitur of a story had been transformed by Lynch into a movie-going experience without equal. That oceanic roar as we probe the auditory canal! Of course the difference between the synopsis and the actual film owes it magnitude not only to the director, but to Badalamenti's score, to the performances (especially Hopper's), and the sets with their shabby furnishings and liver-colored decor.<br/><br/>It's impossible to let Dennis Hopper's performance go unremarked. He's never been better. As the sadistic dope his speech is filled with vulgarities, a kind of concerto of filth with one particular word as the featured instrument. It's not that every other word is a curse. It's every other syllable. <br/><br/>For me, it illustrated the distance between one of the old studio craftsmen, like Curtiz, on the one hand, and a visionary driven by deep and perhaps ill-understood desires, like Hitchcock or Lynch. Before getting into movies, Lynch was trained as an artist and has always been interested in textures. He once got hold of a freshly killed cat carcass, skinned, and slipped it into a Mason jar where he left it overnight. As he described it later, "It went in like a Slinky but the next day it wouldn't come out." <br/><br/>In this instance at least, the cat came out. We all know that David Lynch's movies are deliberately bizarre, and "Blue Velvet" is a very good example. The plot isn't too easy to explain, although it involves Kyle MacLachlan going to care for his father and getting mixed up in all sorts of weird things. The best scenes are of course the parts where Dennis Hopper breathes the strange gas, probably so as to get high.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the title song is a very interesting counterbalance to the movie's strange subject matter. But either way, this is definitely have to see. Isabella Rossellini probably gave her best performance ever here; it's pretty shocking what happens to her here. Also starring are Laura Dern, Hope Lange, Dean Stockwell and Brad Dourif, all doing a great job. Very good. "Bluer than velvet were her eyes. Softer than satin were her sighs."<br/><br/>Well - There's one thing that I can certainly say quite confidently about Blue Velvet - It was a mighty easy movie to detest in so many-many ways.<br/><br/>Apparently Blue Velvet's screenplay had been kicking around in Hollywood for nearly a decade before Dino De Laurentis finally agreed to finance its production.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was completed on a $6 million budget. And, then, on its gala opening weekend it absolutely bombed, big time, with gross revenues of less than $1 million.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a prime example of director David Lynch's perpetually askew vision of things. This film contains all of Lynch's usual signature trademarks of movie-making - From its distorted characters, to its polarized worlds, to the unearthing of the dark underbelly of a seemingly idealized small, American town.<br/><br/>Jeff Beaumont returns to his hometown of Lumberton after being away at college for the most part of the previous year. Following the discovery of a severed, human ear in an open field, Jeff decides that he's not satisfied with the pace of the police investigation. And, so, he and his girlfriend take matters into their own hands, mapping out their own course of action for some reasonable answers.<br/><br/>The object of Jeff and Sandy's investigation turns out to be an oddly mysterious, and completely tone-deaf night club singer who's inexplicably involved with an utterly cruel, sadistic son-of-a-bastard who just loves to inflict pain on others, but, at the same time, is too much of a sniveling, little suck to take any of this ugly, senseless brutality, himself.<br/><br/>When it came to being any sort of "enjoyable" movie-entertainment, all in all, I found Blue Velvet to be too terminally weird for that.<br/><br/>"... and I can still see blue velvet through my tears...." My Rating : 9/10<br/><br/>A classic dark suspense-thriller. Blue Velvet was a flop movie that is now one of the most acclaimed films of the 1980's. Watch out for Dennis Hopper's entrance scene.<br/><br/>THE FILM TASTES EVEN BETTER THAN PABST BLUE RIBBON! BLUE VELVET is perhaps one of David Lynch's best-remembered movies for that, and the reason for that is Dennis Hopper's undeniably electrifying turn as Frank, the villain of the piece. A crazed rapist and altogether nutcase, Hopper is clearly having a ball with the role and becomes one of the best villains of the era alongside the likes of Clarence Boddiker and Hannibal Lector. As for the rest of the film, it's a typical Lynch outing; better than a lot I've watched, but still a bit too slow, arty, and self-conscious for my liking. Kyle MacLachlan is a nice choice for the lead character, his fragility and youth contrasting with the tough characters he meets, and there's some good weirdness and suspense throughout. However, the film is also oddly hollow, and only really picks up in the second half. It's an American suburban crime movie with great acting by Dennis Hopper (bad guy) but overall pretty unmemorable.<br/><br/>The story didn't really offer anything to stand out as most of the actions of the main character did not have meaningful reasoning behind them. Also what was portrayed as bizarre or shocking in here doesn't really convey similar emotions now in 2018 as opposed to what they probably did in 1986. <br/><br/>It's about a young guy who finds a chopped human ear and starts playing detective for no apparent reason. I was recommended by my friend of this movie after I watch Mulholland Dr. "It is a must see Lynch's movie", I quote him. From there, I expect a lot from a man who done so well with Mulholland Dr. An eccentric myself, I'm a fan of the surrealist theme. Plus, I'm obsessed with Lana Del Rey's version of the song. <br/><br/>The expectations are probably just too high that it underwhelmed me. It's not a bad movie, just I expect more. The story is simple with some sexual and violence twist(obviously). The acting is OK, Dennis Hopper is brilliant as always. It just misses the edge that we need from a visionary. Everything is predictable and not a scene stood out. If you need a toned-down version of Mulholland Dr. then probably you should try this one but if you want more, this movie definitely won't give you one.<br/><br/>acting (6) directing (8) story (5) Blue Velvet is a good film. It is above average but it certainly isn't the masterpiece people make it out to be. I remember a lot of people having recommended this to me and I had seen it consistently ranked on top 100 film lists and I must say I was somewhat disappointed when I had finished watching. Maybe it's an acquired taste but too be considered such a classic i thought it would be at least a little better. The performances were first-rate with the exception of Kyle Maclachlan, who at times seemed wooden and forced. Isabella Rossellini was amazing but the real standout was Dennis Hopper, who truly succeeded in everywhere, he's scary, crazed and downright disturbing to watch -- he is the kind of villain that ranks alongside Hannibal Lector. The visual aspect of the film was stunning. The saturated lush reds and the velvet blues were breathtaking. However, as a hole the film fell short. People go on about the hidden meanings and philosophical messages but I honestly think its nothing deeper than your average thriller. It's compelling, but not really worth repeated viewings as I don't think there is much to gain from the film. Blue Velvet is a good movie but nothing more. Clearly, I am not a David Lynch fan. I have watched Blue Velvet, Mulholland Dr., and Inland Empire to try and understand where Lynch's high acclaim comes from, and have yet to find it. The cinematography, plots, and acting proved to be less than mediocre in all three films, and was the least enjoyable in Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>I've tried to sit down and watch this film on numerous occasions, each time with an open mind. I just couldn't get into it. The mysticism that Lynch fans claim to surround the plot wore thin after only thirty minutes of viewing time.<br/><br/>When it comes to mixing drama and thriller elements, I'll stick to Scorsese. Okay, Blue Velvet has style. It has class, it's a more accessible Lynch film. It certainly isn't his best, for that last reason. His films are fun because they have a plot that appears much like a rubbix cube. Unsolvable, while Blue Velvet is simple and screaming for attention, in the very silliest ways.<br/><br/>The film is completely empty. It is a thriller with a simple plot that gets tired and meaningless after a second viewing. Probably one of the most overrated movies in existence, how do so many people see this as being great film-making? It is crude, inept and sickening. I was even more mortified when I found this had 7.8/10, when it should stand at a very fortunate (for a movie as tasteless as this) 4.8/10 Why couldn't this have faded into the obscurity of a horrible former 'success', instead of having become a highly regarded classic of modern cinema. What have people come to? This review is not at all fair as I only watched the first half of the movie but the absolutely DREADFUL AMATEURISH acting of Kyle MacLachlan put me off SO MUCH I was unable to watch the rest.
The story is quite good and the other actors are at least 'performing' but Kyle's 'style'...if it is intentional, seems more like a first read-through than a completed job.
I realize he's still VERY junior in his acting career at this point but WHY ON EARTH was such an unskilled amateur given such a major role?
I'm sorry for the incomplete review and as such it is not really a valid one but with a performance as shoddy as his something has to be said. David Lynch, Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper and Laura Dern are very much at there personal peaks with Blue Velvet, a brilliantly crafted drama film that mixes elements of crime and neo-noir. The film has become iconic to audiences for being bizarre and provocatively sexual and probably quite sacrilegious. But people who have actually seen the film will know that, really, it is deep, not overtly sexual. Some critics have deemed it as being borderline pornography, well they are obviously well out of touch with what the word 'pornography' actually means. It is a strong, emotionally wrenching film about the disarray of human nature, the loss of innocence and surfaces. Surfaces that represent all things beautiful, that lure you in, and then show you what they really are. Disgusting, terrifyingand only imaginable in your very worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is about a young man, Jeffrey, who is innocent and naive, but has a little taste for voyeur, and likes to sometimes walk on the wild side. His girlfriend, alike in many ways, even questions 'is he a detective, or a pervert?' even she's not entirely convinced her boyfriends exceptionally normal. When we are finished with Blue Velvet, where not entirely sure either. Jeffrey is caught up in a sensual, depraved underworld he never knew his town had. And from then on, we see Jeffrey defeat the villain, and restore his innocence. Clearly, that is no average drama, and certainly no average film. That's what makes it so great. The performances, menacing score, I could go on for day and night effortlessly typing about why this is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. And very easily, my favourite. Hilarious satire of suburban America, with MacLaughlin and Dern as supposedly young innocent types who become involved in a kidnapping case. The plot is (as usual from writer Lynch) straight out of an 1890s melodrama -- in this case, it involves a woman (Rossellini) whose husband and son have been kidnapped by a sadist (Hopper) who wants her to be his fetish doll. What strikes me as really telling and disturbing is how detatched MacLaughlin and Dern are, emotionally, from some of the events they come across and even the pain of the victims of their crimes, but are erotically charged by coming into contact with them.  Frank tells him he's "like me." Hopper provides many memorable moments in an incredibly broad style (if method actors are let loose, the whole movie must support them, as this one does), and Stockwell has a good bit as the laconic host of a Pabst Blue Ribbon party straight out of somebody's dreams or nightmares.  "In dreams, I think of you"..... scary and funny Maybe it's just me, maybe I am talking out of ignorance, but I hated this movie. It didn't say anything, it didn't go anywhere, it just was, and I didn't like what it was. The performances were all good, the directing was good, but I just hated the movie. I felt uncomfortable during the entire film, which I don't mind if there is a point behind it. But this movie, I just couldn't find anything I liked about it. I see a lot of movies, and at my college, I am the guy most people go to when they need movies recommended or to borrow, but this is one that all my knowledge can't help me with. If you like uber-bizarre cinema that lacks anything resembling literal storytelling or any logical progression, this is probably your movie. If you like movies that have good plots and mean something, however, better go somewhere else, cause it ain't here (I suggest the Usual Suspects or Anything by Tarantino myself, but different strokes...). No doubt this is supposed to be clever but it is a gruelling miserable two hours of violent, sadistic nonsense. I've long since known that my principles, values, and lifestyle don't line up with Hollywood. What they consider art, brilliance, and genius I consider trash a lot of the time. Sex, violence, and homosexuality tend to reserve the largest spot in their heart and the more inexplicable the sex and violence are the more of a masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" was one of those movies with inexplicable sex and violence and I don't know how a movie this bad is rated nearly 8/10. Maybe I'm naive or sheltered though I don't think so being that I was born and raised in the S.F. Bay Area, but I don't know in what universe a woman finds a man hiding in her closet and punishes him with sexual favors. I'm sure peeping toms and perverts everywhere rejoiced at seeing that.<br/><br/>That same man who was so desperate to reunite this woman with her husband continued to bed her at every opportunity. I suppose he wanted to reunite the two after he was done getting what he wanted. That was our hero, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan). He was so selfless that not only did he repeatedly have sex with this victimized woman, he beat her when she begged for it. If only all men were as noble as he.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when a movie is exceptionally bad I can't help but associate the lead actor with it and that association follows him or her to other movies. The same is true when an actor is in an exceptionally good movie. Kyle MacLachlan was the lead actor in "The Fly 2," which I hated, so when I saw his face I had this sudden revulsion which I couldn't immediately place. It took a few seconds then I realized he was the lead in "The Fly 2" which put me on guard involuntarily like I was bracing for a terrible sight. My instincts were correct because this movie was awful. There was no sense to be made of it at all even though I had so much hope.<br/><br/>When Jeffrey started sleuthing around to find out what was going on behind the disembodied ear he found, I thought this could be cool. That lasted maybe thirty minutes or whenever he was found hiding in Dorothy Vallens' closet. From there it was typical Hollywood B.S. with spontaneous and unlikely sex along with stylized violence. I'm perfectly fine being revulsed by this "art" and I hope I always will be. Blue Velvet (1986) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>One of the strangest films ever made has Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) finding a severed ear in a field, which leads him on a journey investigating it. He ends up in the apartment of a singer (Isabella Rossellini) who has a child and husband being held captive by the psychopath Frank (Dennis Hopper). I've seen this movie countless times over the years and a lot more times that I normally would considering I really don't love this movie like many do. I don't love the movie yet at the same times there's just something so strange and surreal about the thing that I find myself getting caught up in its web of strangeness. I think Lynch does a great job at building up the atmosphere as every single scene in the film has something bizarre going on. Even the opening with the lovely title song being played has one strange image after another and this section here is the purist thing we're going to see. I love the way Lynch starts the film off by showing a typical American town before quickly changing it some sort of nightmare world that would really only exist in the director's mind. The film is full of weird characters, strange situations and numerous WTF moments with many of them coming from Hopper. The role of Frank is certainly one of the most memorable villains in the history of cinema with his constant screaming and huffing whatever drug he is taking to get high. There's no denying that Hopper made this role his own and I doubt anyone else could have done more with it. On one level we're suppose to be terrified of Frank but I've always found the role to be somewhat like able just because of how crazy he is. Perhaps Lynch wanted this but I've never really feared Frank while watching this movie but instead I just viewed him as entertainment. For such an evil man he certainly can make you smile and laugh at some of the things he does. MacLachlan is also very good as the hero here and Laura Dern isn't too bad as his helper. Rossellini certainly gives a very brave performance here as she's asked to do some pretty ugly stuff and she handles it all extremely well. There are several plot holes in the film and at times I wondered if the actual story really meant anything or if it was just overlooked for the next weird set piece. Lynch certainly creates a "nightmare" here with his vision and on that level it makes the film worth viewing. At the same time I can't help but think the film should have and could have been much, much better. Oscar nominated director and Golden Globe nominated writer David Lynch might be successful with films that don't always make sense, e.g. Lost Highway, Mullholland Drive, all very good, but I personally prefer the films that you can understand, e.g. The Elephant Man, Wild at Heart and this fantastic mystery thriller. Basically, on the way from seeing his father Tom (Jack Harvey), who suffered a near fatal stroke, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) finds a severed human ear in a field, and takes it to Det. John Williams (George Dickerson). When Jeffrey goes to Williams' house for more info, he meets his daughter Sandy (Laura Dern), and she has heard quite a bit about the ear, and about a woman who may have something to do with it, club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini). Overly curious, Jeffrey devises a plan to sneak into Dorothy's apartment, first posing as pest control, and with his found key going back when she's gone. Unfortunately while snooping, Dorothy catches Jeffrey in the closet, and at first is threatening him with a knife, but is then attracted by his voyeurism. They are interrupted (and Jeffrey hides again) by the arrival of foul-mouthed and violent crime boss Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who has very weird sexual desire, e.g. calling Dorothy "mummy" while she spreads her legs, sadomasochistic slapping, and then raping her. Jeffrey was shocked when after Frank had left, and she tries to seduce him again, she demands to be hit. Jeffrey doesn't say much about it to Sandy, but he decides to go back to find out more about Dorothy, and he is convinced that Frank has kidnapped her husband and son, and the ear is the husband's as a warning. Unfortunately Jeffrey is caught by Frank and his buddies coming out of Dorothy's apartment, and so begins a very hellish night with him accompanying them to the house of Frank's partner in crime Ben (Dean Stockwell), and ending with a nasty beating while Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" is playing. The next day, Jeffrey decides to show the photos he took of Frank and his partners doing drug business to Det. Williams, and of course, he recognises Det. Tom Gordon, aka "The Yellow Man" (Fred Pickler), he warns Jeffrey of the danger he may be in. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance party, embracing their newfound love, and after a quick squabble with Sandy's original boyfriend Mike (Ken Stovitz), Dorothy appears distressed with no clothes and some blood on Jeffrey's front lawn. Jeffrey tells Sandy he must return to Dorothy's apartment, and there he finds the dead bodies of The Yellow Man and Dorothy's husband (the man missing an ear), and he realises when trying to get help on the police radio, Frank (disguised briefly as The Well Dressed Man) has one too, but Jeffrey managed to trick him, get a gun, and kill Frank before he can kill him, and Det. Williams arrives telling him it's over, and it ends with Jeffrey and Sandy relaxing together, and Dorothy playing with her son. Also starring Hope Lange as Mrs. Williams, Priscilla Pointer as Mrs. Beaumont, Frances Bay as Aunt Barbara, Brad Dourif as Raymond and Jack Nance as Paul. I don't whether the title is based on the 1963 song by Bobby Vinton, or the fact that Dorothy does wear it, but who cares. Hopper is fantastic, and this film saved his career, he returned after many drug related problems, so he knew how to play the character because he had lived it. MacLachlan, Rossellini and Dern add very good support as well, and Lynch has created a very convincing vision with a a weird, but very credible script. I should mention, my Granddad's name coincidently is Frank Booth. Dennis Hopper was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 49 on The World's Greatest Actor, Frank Booth was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding! The acting and the cinematography are suburb, however the film is banal and tries too hard Fortunately for Hopper only one word he had to remember all his for lines. He was as scary as finding a hair in my salad.<br/><br/>David Lynch is well named. After a few scenes the viewer would rather have been lynched. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" Is hard to watch at best, due to the extreme sexual violence in contrast to the occasional mildly graphic imagery. It follows the slightly naive burgeoning teenager Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) and his discovery of a severed ear, which eventually leads to a series of increasingly bonkers and perverse sequences.<br/><br/>A problem I have always had with this film is its sexual violence, it captured such raw emotion that never paired with its overall style, the feeling it evokes does not belong in this fever dream of a film. If Lynch had put forth a less surreal world and furthered the emotional weight it could've been a rather powerful experience, or if he did the antagonistic and diffused its sexual violence, it could've worked a bit better for me.<br/><br/>But the film also carries many positives, so I won't blubber in the cynical and mention them. Dennis Hopper's (Frank Booth) is a masterclass in powerful villains, he is possibly my favourite ever created. He was written to insult the darkest depths of our minds, tapping in to unsanitary places we attempt avoid at all costs, and could there be any man more brilliant to play this gas huffing psychopath than Dennis Hopper, he captures David Lynch's vision of insanity so perfectly, creating a generally intimidating madman in the process.<br/><br/>Its surreal tone is also brilliant if you disregard the sexual violence, it is so comically perverse, like a dress with nobody to wear it, dancing in a harrowing slow motion, it speaks volumes, yet it is so empty in the best possible definition, almost finding pleasure in how uncomfortable it makes us feel.<br/><br/>The subjective editing this film contains is in your face and one for the ages, creating a sexual Hitchcockian placebo, the flashbacks are fast with jarring audio, the violence is cruel and even after its single frame of prominence it remains in the air, like a thick odour of perfume, forever seared into our brains, just like Jerry.<br/><br/>Conclusion, the film is unbelievably hard to watch, making it a tough watch for some viewers, but all in all, I do recommend this movie, and if you disregard some of the slightly offensive details, it becomes a passionate and savage adventure. This movie is not for everyone but for those who respect the boundaries of art, this is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Blue Velvet is one of Lynch's more coherent movies. The storyline is challenging, but not obtuse. It's linear and easy to follow for someone who cares to pay attention. This is not the case with some of Lynch's recent efforts - the television series "Twin Peaks" and movies like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive have led to much head-scratching and groping in the dark for decoder rings. Compared to them, Blue Velvet is straightforward. Lynch's trademark weirdness is very much on display, but, in this outing, he has channeled it for a purpose other than merely shocking and confusing an audience. I shall not say much as this is a film that should be seen to be experienced. "Credo quia absurdum" is a Latin phrase that means "I believe it because it is absurd". Replace "believe" with "watch" and you have the perfect phrase to define this movie. The best advice I can give to all future viewers is to watch this movie with as little previous information as possible. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of an hipster artist randomly throwing paint at a canvas and calling it an art piece, it's trash, I give it a 4/10 for the ''film noir'' element. Twin Peaks is one of the greatest tv show television ever aired, was it luck from Lynch ? he wasn't alone on the project and maybe Lynch simply need someone to guide him a little, I do think he know his way around a camera, I sure do... he has his own visual style, which I really like, the real problem are his scripts, the story is not that good, it doesn't gel, the interactions between the characters feel empty... people who likes that movie are pretentious, I suggest Kar-Wai Wong instead of Lynch if you like meaning behind a scene, the movie is not that bad, it's just not worth the investment "Blue Velvet" is, in my opinion, a good film, but it didn't have the effect as "Mulholland" and "Eraserhead". I feel like this film is Lynchian-lite; there are moments when Lynch's weirdness really shines through, but for the most part, this feels remarkably tame compared to what I'm used to seeing from him. I think my biggest thing about this Lynch film in particular was that it really didn't leave me much to think on; he had made most of the conclusions for me.
When I come to the end of "Mulholland" or "Eraserhead", I find myself still searching for answers and pondering certain scenes. In "Blue Velvet" the story has pretty much been told in full. As the great Russian director Andrey Tarkovsky said in his book Sculpting in Time; "When less than everything has been said about a subject, you can still think on further. The alternative is for the audience to be presented with a final deduction, for no effort of their part, and that is not what they need. What can it mean to them when they have not shared with the author the misery and joy of bringing an image into being?"
If I had seen this film before "Mulholland Drive" or "Eraserhead" I probably would've liked it a lot more, but as it stands, I think this is just a good addition to Lynch's oeuvre; it's by no means the pique of his career.
For our full review of Blue Velvet and hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media! Strangely stylistic, Lynch's mastery of music and direction makes this an unsettling yet seductive film. This particularly comes through in the scenes where the songs 'Blue Velvet' and 'In Dreams' are used. However, the last third of the film doesn't quite keep up the same sense of mystery and the same beguiling atmosphere that makes the rest of it so bewitching. This has always been one of my most favorite films I wanted to write a more detailed review about this film, but having seen the end I am irritated and confused. What the hell was the Mary Poppins animatronic robin doing in the film? Strangely enough, out of all the bizarre scenes in the film, this is the one that has implanted itself into my head. Tbh I'm thinking about making my boyfriend watch this with me so I have someone to talk with about the oddness that is this movie. It's kind of like a train wreck, it's so bad and you know deep down you shouldn't watch but you just can't seem to look away. I will say this much, it was far different from any other movie I've ever seen. I'm not sure that I actually liked it but I watched the whole thing and felt as though I needed to see it through to find out what happened in the end. It's got some pretty bad overacting and some of the strangest sex scenes I've ever witnessed....but at least its not boring. David Lynch's films are a truly unique, mind bending experience and "Blue Velvet" is a prime example. I always recommend knowing as little as possible before diving into his films, they simply can't be described by plot, character or any other typical reduction. This film is a piece of art. 5 June 2010. Perhaps when this retro-50s movie of the 80s came out, it had shock value and crossed the forbidden taboo barrier of sadomasochism, nearly a quarter of century later, it in some ways depicts both a level of (at the time) mainstream insanity, perversion of popular, wide-released film-making that has in few instances yet to be duplicated and yet at the same time, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the music have all advanced in quality and impact since then, leaving this cult movie with more rust spots and not so interesting storyline. David Lynch perhaps introduced early on important standards for later movies (the eerie hollow sounds that later would be heard in ALIEN (1979). Somehow, watching this movie, there are elements that were eventually put to even better effect in TWIN PEAKS (1990) directed by David Lynch and starring the Kyle MacLachlan both important part of BLUE VELVET. The most fascinating character, Dorothy Vallens, played by Isabella Rossellini, doesn't quite get developed and relationally portrayed with the biting impact that would have clearly lasted the test of time and even the ending of this movie was so retro-50s and it seemed to lose its retro-effect and become instead of retro, more in line of a 50s movie instead of something new and refreshing, almost as if the director betrayed the intent of the movie's initial premise. Nevertheless, this movie did shock and it did supply some valuable cinematic elements that would later be enhanced in movies. Dennis Hopper brings Frank despicably to life. You will love hating his character! Isabella Rosselini's character is sad, desperate and sexy! Where was she when I was growing up! Yeah, I know! That sucked! This movie is dark, bizarre, and up for interpretation! You'll love it!! Can't believe how well this movie holds up! The cinematography is luscious. Every quirky shot and piece of dialogue lead to heighten the drama. BRAVO MR LYNCH! Voyeurism, singing, warm beer and not your standard damsel in distress. Weird for the sake of being weird? Possibly. A dark and twisted take on a small town boy who happens upon a mystery that stems from an ear covered with ants in a field that he subsequently brings to the local police's attention. Arguably David Lynch's best film but no disputing that it has Dennis Hopper's greatest performance ever. He might tell you not too look at him but it's impossible not to Lumberton is an idyllic small town. With his father in the hospital, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns home from school to help out at the family store. He discovers a severed human ear in a field. After an unsatisfying visit to the police detective, he pairs up with his daughter Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) to do their own investigation. Only what find is the ugly violent underbelly with the face of crazed evil.<br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini puts in a beautifully damaged performance, and Dennis Hopper creates one of the most iconic crazy psychopath in movie history. It is however director/writer David Lynch's intensely weird vision that has made this a must see. His unique style has no equal. He has shocked the American cinema out of its idyllic existence. Six-hundred reviews, so what's left to say. A brief comparison of Lynch's artistic sensibility with Hitchcock's may be in order. Hitch too liked to find the sinister in the ordinary, e.g. Shadow of a Doubt (1943) being the most obvious, but including many others. Shading criminal behavior into a canvas of everyday life lent many of Hitch's movies a particular impact—you never knew when the wicked might erupt in your own life. After all, it emerged on a background of complete normalcy in the movie. As a result, leaving the theatre and the movie didn't mean you were leaving the unsettled feeling behind. Hitch had undermined life as the average theatre-goer understood it. I don't claim this as a universal reaction, but I think it does point to his endurance as a headline moviemaker.<br/><br/>In Blue Velvet, Lynch too appears to be aiming for a similar result. He inserts quick snatches of ordinary life, such as the lumber truck or Mrs. Williams, the unaffected housewife, but abandons them quickly. His sensibility is simply not interested in portraying the banal. Instead, Lynch is preoccupied with shock effects rather than the more subtle Hitchcockian effect of unsettling the viewer. He does this through his the of grotesque characters and situations. Even his characterization of normal life is undermined by hidden aspects in the lead character— Jeffrey's growing response to Dorthy' s s&m—and by the artificiality of the movie's final scenes of a "return to normalcy". Thus, Lynch's evil, if you will, exists in a surreal world apart from what we perceive as our own. So, leaving the theatre means leaving the threat behind, even as the vivid grotesqueries of a Frank or a Ben remain. As good as the movie is in its shock value, it remains something apart, a vivid artistic curiosity on screen, but little more.<br/><br/>My point is that if you really want to unsettle the audience, you keep the ordinary, ordinary, as boring as that may seem. Of course, in retrospect, Hitch tended to idealize the normal, but then he was part of a different movie-making era from Lynch. His was the Production Code era when Hollywood insisted that wrongdoers be punished. So viewers could leave the theater content that at least evildoers were punished in the end. Of course, that kind of unrealistic comfort is not provided in Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>All in all, I think Lynch has fashioned a scary classic, but in my book, Hitch remains ultimately more threatening. Blue Velvet contains some great performances; Isabella Rossellini (apart from the singing - don't give up the day job, Izzy) pulls out all the stops as a sado-masochistic nightclub singer, Dennis Hopper gives it the full nine yards as an amyl nitrite(?) sucking nutjob, and Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern do Brad and Janet from 'Rocky Horror Show' to perfection. The performances are what keeps Blue Velvet interesting, and it seems to me that Lynch allows most scenes to go on a little too long in order that we get full value from the actors or can appreciate his own direction. Many times I found myself thinking, 'Okay, I get the point of the scene, you can cut now'.<br/><br/>And Blue velvet fails the feminism test; none of the women characters has a conversation with another female character independently of the males, and their whole lives seem to be lived merely as appendages to the man business going on.<br/><br/>The film is obviously meticulously planned in the Hitchcockian way, but the thriller maguffin is an amateur sleuth investigating a small-town kidnapping - hardly the sort of caper that will maintain your interest in a full-length feature without the full-frontal nudity. Hitchcock would have brought in world politics, or 'deep' psychological issues. So in that way the sex is gratuitous - the only reason for it is to keep you watching because the plot's so thin.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is well made and well acted, but as a piece of art, it's about as significant as a really good comic - not even a graphic novel.<br/><br/>No twist at the end either, the goodies prevail; and that's not much of a payoff for sitting through such a thin story. David Lynch's film "Blue Velvet" is a film with beautiful directing view.. The atmosphere has muffled intensity..This is very important in a movie.. I never get bored when i watch "Blue Velvet"!!!<br/><br/>Generally this film is a masterpiece of the kind!!<br/><br/>But it has TWO things in the script that makes the script a little bit compatible..!! :<br/><br/>First, when Jeffrey and Sandy go to the bar where Dorothy works ,why are they spending their time to drink and watch Dorothy singing??? They leave when the singer ends her program! Of course Jeffrey then has little time to search her apartment!<br/><br/>Second, "THERE IS A BIG COINCIDENCE"!!!! : When Dorothy comes, it happens that Jeffrey is in the bathroom and when Sandy must honk the car's horn , that time Jeffrey pulls the flush!! COINCIDENCE OR EASE SCENARIO???<br/><br/>Except those two details the film is a MUST!!!! Jeffrey Beaumont returns to him home town Lumberton, after his father suffers a near fatal stroke.He finds a severed human ear in a field, and starts solving the case.He gets help from detective Williams' daughter Sandy.In his investigation he runs into a nightclub singer called Dorothy Vallens.She's involved with the most vicious man, Frank Booth.Blue Velvet (1986) is a mystery thriller from director David Lynch.The late great Dennis Hopper gives the most powerful performance as Frank Booth.An actor must really awake his dark side in a role like this, and that's what Dennis Hopper did.He is in this movie with all his demons.When the villain of the movie is that great, the other actors must be really good.And they are.Kyle MacLachlan, who was also in Lynch' Twin Peaks, is gives a convincing performance as Jeffrey.Isabella Rossellini is just amazing as Dorothy.Laura Dern is marvelous as Sandy.Dean Stockwell is terrific as Ben.Priscilla Pointer is very good as Mrs. Beaumont.Also very good job from Hope Lange, who plays Mrs. Williams.George Dickerson is terrific as Detective Williams.Frances Bay, who passed away less than two months ago, is superb as Aunt Barbara.Brad Dourif is excellent as Raymond.David Lynch, 65, hasn't made a feature film in five years.This is one of his most knows films.It is quite incredible, like when Jeffrey is in the closet watching Frank and Dorothy.Lynch' movies aren't the easiest ones around.It's more about the atmosphere than the plot and stuff.His movies are journeys into human mind.The dark side... I remember Mulholland Dr. being the first movie that I sat down and analyzed in depth. There was multiple viewings and with each viewing something more brilliant emerged. This did not happen with this movie. This is my second time watching this movie and it gave me the same impression I had the first time I watched it. I do love this movie and I think Dorothy Vallens is worth hours of discussions alone. In my mind she is the one of the more interesting characters Lynch has used. There is something relatable about her character more than the rest of the characters. She is scared, vulnerable, and so little of her life in her control. She wants to be loved, but is so damaged that she does not understand love in the way that does not frighten the rest of us. I do love this character, but she is surrounded by such a strange cast of characters I do not know what to think of the world she exists in. She seems to be stuck somewhere in the middle of Frank Booth's world and Jeffrey and Sandy's world.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is what makes Blue Velvet interesting. The opening sequence is brilliant and really sets the stage. This is a perfect example of how to create atmosphere for the rest of the movie. I think the ending of the movie involves a little analysis. The robin at the end of the movie is holding one of the beetles from the beginning of the movie, but it is only one beetle. The interesting thing that I am getting from Lynch is that the seedy underworld that the bugs and dirt represent are necessary for the rest of the world to exists in its happy little bubble. Removing one bug does not do anything to stop that world from existing, but it does in a way feed the bright world that Sandy's life represents. <br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie is the soundtrack and it is the only thing keeping the movie from falling apart. The two extremes do not play off each very well in my opinion. The seedy underworld is to lawless, while the picturesque world is too clean. When the two of them are interacting I am not sure how to take it. It is hard to judge the acting here, because all of it is over the top. I think Rossellini did a great job, but honestly I am not sure about the other performances. Dean Stockwell comes to mind. Either it is brilliant or terrible. I am not sure which. I am sure the performances are exactly what Lynch wanted, but to me it they seem too over the top for either one to work. <br/><br/>A last word about Frank Booth: Frank Booth will remain one of the most memorable villains in movie history and unfortunately this was my first exposure to Dennis Hopper so now anything I see him in I see Frank Booth. <br/><br/>This movie is very much a David Lynch film. There is no arguing that. It is obviously brilliant and there is some extremely tight direction, with some fantastic lighting and a soundtrack that is spot on. But overall that movie did not make me sit up. It is definitely worth a watch if you are a Lynch fan or are just looking for something new. David Lynch's film Blue Velvet starring Isabella Rossellini as the troubled Dorothy Vallens, Kyle MacLachlan as Jeffery Beaumont, and Dennis Hopper as the psychotic Frank Booth was released in 1986 is a movie shrouded in mystery, crime, and thrills. College aged Jeffery Beaumont is on his way to the hospital to visit his father who has been admitted for an unrevealed reason. On his way home he finds a severed ear in a field behind his neighborhood. Being the upstanding young man he is, turns the ear into the local detective in town (George Dickerson), and is told to keep the information he has about the ear to himself during the investigation. On his way home from visiting the detective, he meets the detective's daughter Sandy Williams, (Laura Dern- Jurassic Park.) Who entices Jeffery's curiosity about the case and gives him a possible suspect that she has overheard her father talking about in his office. The suspect Dorothy Vallens, is a troubled women who lives alone in an apartment building in town. The two decide to do a little investigating on their own, and trick Dorothy to letting them in her apartment. Jeffery decides he needs to sneak in later when Dorothy is not around to "look around." What he discovers in his quite, innocent town is an underworld of darkness, drugs, sex, corruption, and downright psychotic people all round him in which he can't walk away from and just goes further and further down the rabbit hole. As the plot thickens Jeffery is sucked into the dark world of Dorothy's life, he seems confused as to what life he should focus on, his newly found love with Sandy, or his intriguing visceral obsession with the troubled Dorothy. But his choice to entertain Dorothy intertwines him with Dennis Hopper's crazy character, Frank Booth. Frank is a drug dealing, corrupt killer hell bent on the dark life of drugs, money, and sex. Hopper never strays from character and his acting is on point throughout, you instantly hate him when you first meet him, and notice that his obsession with Blue Velvet is what ties him and Dorothy together. Dorothy is a singer at a night club and Frank takes her son hostage to fuel his obsession, she must sing for him and wear blue velvet whenever Frank is around to suffice his obsession. This movie has the deep psychological aspects of crime movies such as Reservoir Dogs and House of Games. Once the movie begins to pick up, the suspense keeps you glued to the screen, the main characters acting is decent, but the rest of the cast is lacking and somewhat corny. The use of low-key lighting is present throughout the film, which is when most of the film is set in shadow, and very few highlights define the subject. The use of this lighting effect sharpened the suspense and created a solemn mood in the movie. This was used to illustrate the dark world in which Dorothy, Frank, and now Jeffery lived in. The first person film angle when Jeffery is hiding in Dorothy's closest gives you the feeling your looking through his eyes and feeling the senses Jeffery is feeling, your heart races as the scenes unfold and you understand his position better this way than what you would if you weren't seeing exactly what he was seeing. Jeffery couldn't help but dig deeper and deeper into the dark world he uncovered. His unrelenting curiosity almost cost him Sandy and more importantly his life. Curiosity killed the cat..almost. Underneath his naive demeanor David Lynch is a man of peculiar daydreams: disquieting, uncomfortable visions, which he is perhaps too adept at capturing on film. His inspiration for this art house freak show (in retrospect the first in a decade-long rut of repetitive grotesquery) is the image of a severed human ear, discovered in a field by young Kyle MacLaghlin and, not unlike Pandora's Box, revealing a netherworld of vice and corruption lurking (as always) just beneath the wholesome façade of Main Street, USA. There's a temptation to compare the film to Lynch's midnight cult classic 'Eraserhead', as it shares much of the same malignant spirit and allegorical pretensions, but without the saving grace of black and white photography to help soften the brutal details. Despite the unique point of view and often absurd touches of humor it still comes dangerously close to exploitation: just the thing for jaded metropolitan filmgoers who still consider 'suburbia' a dirty word. There's the suspense of a Hitchock film with the shock of a, well, David Lynch film.<br/><br/>Incredible acting, especially by Dennis Hopper, along with with great cinematography and an intriguing and approachable protagonist, make this film unforgettable. The movie will make you sweat.<br/><br/>Some parts of it seem out of place, but you can always chalk them up to red herrings. The sex that may have been too explicit and gratuitous in 1986 now seems pretty moderate although the sadism could be cause for discomfort. The repeated line of "Don't look at me" fits in perfectly. And the climax won't let you down. Contains Spoilers! I've seen this film at least 7 times and recently on IFC or Sundance (they are right next to each other on my boob tube channels). Depending on one's mood, I can accept many different reactions. BUT, if one can't see the humor in the presentation of this story, one is missing the point.<br/><br/>It starts at the beginning. Lumberton is introduced as the perfect, small town tongue-in-cheek as possible, ending in the old man's stroke which concludes with the phallic hose shooting upward to be drank by the dog! If you're not hip to the satirical quality of what's to come, I can't blame Mr. Lynch. I'll not belabor the point, as the rest of the film from character dynamics, (Very Good and Innocent versus Very Bad and Violent) to it's plot (Hardy Boy goes X-Rated) speaks for itself. This is one hilarious movie! Yet, Mr. Lynch, doesn't fall in love with one theme. The film IS disturbing, especially the love affair between Jeffrey and Dorothy and its violent sexuality. Again, though, this is introduced at its beginning as a type of game when she makes him strip with the knife after taking Frank's abuse. A sick game, surely, which tears up the very innocent Jeffrey's moral compass.<br/><br/>As soon as Frank takes Jeffrey and Dorothy on the "Joy Ride," the film takes off again to amazing effect. Frank and his crew are so over the top evil! It again, takes the form of an intense satire. Somehow, through Mr. Lynch's artistry we never quit caring about Jeffrey and Dorothy, though. The movie walks the thin line as most of Mr. Lynch's films do; am I horrified, or amused? Let's just say both, though on repeated viewings the hysterical laughter takes precedence. He continually sets us up for the the Big Kicker (like the Candy Colored Clown They Call The Sand Man). Wow, who else is capable of this? The short answer is: no one. As for anyone that thinks the ending might be contrived... Check Out That Robin! A wonderful last joke, set up again brilliantly my a true master of cinema. Lumberton rules. A lot of people consider Blue Velvet to be a masterpiece. Heck, it's even regarded as a classic today. Kudos to its cast for accepting such controversial, high-risk roles, but particularly Isabella Rossellini, who spends half of the film battered, naked and abused. I first saw Blue Velvet in 1986, the hype that the film had created was immense. Everyone was talking about this bizarre little art-movie. I was in awe by it when I first saw it in the cinemas. I thought I liked it, but I recently re-watched it. The film does not hold up on repeated viewings. Its not really that it's a great film so much as its just so engrossing, which any good film is, but in this case you sort of fall into a black hole. There's sex and violence but little substance. There's nothing behind the glossy set design and there aren't in hidden meanings that the viewer wouldn't be aware of when first watching the film. There's nothing hidden. It's an average thriller, but it certainly isn't nothing more. I adore the way in which Lynch leads you into his own microcosm, each screen is more intriguing than the previous and you become involved with the characters. Blue Velvet, his 'classic' to many, is no exception: a simple town boy is intrigued by a mysterious, beautiful woman, and following his curiosity gets drawn into her web, only to inadvertently uncover dark mysteries. We take this genuinely and often weirdly funny walk with him, a walk that'll cling to your thoughts long after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>I don't idolize Lynch as many people seem to (although I admired his work in The Straight Story) and I believe he has too often pursued weirdness for the sake of weirdness. But at his best he has produced marvels of film making. Blue Velvet is one of the latter as it doozily exposes the hidden dark underbelly of small towns, and of people that are seldom what they seem on the surface.<br/><br/>More than one viewing of this film is probably necessary if you really want to get it. The first time round, I ended up thinking that this was simply a self-indulgent, pretentious 'noir-ish' attempt at vulgar violence and gratuitous sexuality. The second viewing actually made me see some of the things Lynch wanted us to see without the shock factor.<br/><br/>Even so, this one may not be for everyone, but essential viewing for cinephiles and a must for Lynch fans. This being my first Lynch film I knew that, like so many others, I might not "get" his surrealistic and metaphorical approach to film making. To my delight I found the more bizarre sequences a joy, and appreciated the director's keen eye for stark, beautiful images and his willingness to define a new kind of movie experience. Why the 6 out of 10 score then? Well, direction alone doesn't make a movie. The lead, Kyle Machlachlan, started out a bit dull, but after the first half hour improved. However Laura Dern was predictable, boring and formulaic - really unengaging. I just did not care for her character. Dennis Hopper's mad sweary guy routine felt inspired for maybe 10 minutes before it became gratuitous and somewhat ridiculous (in a bad way). The script was filled with great lines and absolute clunkers in equal measure (Dern describing her dream was positively cringe-worthy). And while Lynch has an inspired eye for disturbing and dark sequences (the finale in Vallens' room is brilliant), these sequences are negated by appalling optimistic scenes which seemed totally out of place with the feel and tone of the film. The last scene could have been extracted from a Disney film. So, in all, a wonderful visual treat, a magnificently ambiguous and surreal experience, but severely hampered by unlikeable characters and an occasionally poor script. Yet I hope to enjoy another Lynch film in the near future.<br/><br/>6/10 This is a love-it or hate-it film. Its a classic and a masterpiece to be remembered for its role in the evolution of film. Director and writer Lynch juxtaposes a white-picket-fence idyllic small town against the darkest of the freaky drug-addicted criminals. Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey, the decent young man the audience can identify with, while Dennis Hopper perfectly portrays an emotionally disturbed on-the-edge criminal. The Isabella Rosselini character is stuck between the two worlds, a mother desperately trying to stay mainstream but stuck with ties to the sadistic on-the-edge criminals.<br/><br/>The dark crime side of this movie is downright scary, not necessarily for any blood and guts, but because you know these people are off their rocker and can snap at any minute. Seeing the sexually ambiguous Ben (Dean Stockwell) sing a candy pop song in a dark den of gangsters, loose women, guns, and drugs is truly startling. Lynch repeatedly pairs the goody-good with the downright evil for sharp contrast and a lasting effect.<br/><br/>As a big fan of this movie (owning pretty much everything associated with the film I can get my hands on), I'm having no trouble in recommending it, but on a non-bias point of view, you still should see this film, particularly for its influence. It is a must-see if you are going through all the classics. Recently, I've become a pretty big David Lynch fan after seeing films such as Eraserhead, Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. What I love about those three movies is that the plots are so bizarre and confusing that they require the viewer to come up with their own conclusions and meanings. This film wasn't like his others. It follows a straight time line and there aren't any confusing plot points. I realize this may be a good thing for most people but it was disappointing to me compared to his previous work. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, it just didn't feel like David Lynch to me very much at all.<br/><br/>I have heard from multiple people that this was the most creepy film they had ever seen but I couldn't see it. The acting is amazing which should be expected from the great cast. I liked the story and remained hooked but like I said, it wasn't confusing or weird enough. The direction is brilliant as usual from Lynch. Overall, it's an enjoyable and very good film but I wouldn't put it up with David Lynch's other films. I don't think I have ever been so repulsed and impressed by a film at the same time. Blue Velvet is as dazzling as it is dark and unflinching. The film is home to some truly horrifying characters, featuring an impressive, memorable Dennis Hopper in his best identified role and a mysteriously seductive Isabella Rossellini. It is a film about depravity lying under the most unlikely surfaces. You could easily call it American Beauty without the family dysfunction, as it appears American Beauty was influenced heavily by this 1986 classic. This was recommended numerous times to me as I was a huge Twin Peaks fan, and this has been often compared to Twin Peaks, and both were healmed by maverick director David Lynch. This is a stunning, explosive and extremely powerful movie, many scenes still replaying in my mind, namely the infamous "closet" scene in which the lead character Jeffrey investigates a womans apartment who may or may not be the suspect of a murder case that has rocked a small town to its foundations. What he witnesses while hiding inside her closet is something that I will probably never forget. The memorable opening of Blue Velvet introduces us to the idyllic town of Lumberton, where fresh-faced urchins stay in the crosswalks, firemen merrily wave from their hook-and-ladder truck, red roses line brisk, white picket fences, and neighbors enjoy the blazing sunshine as they hose down their impossibly green lawns. The view then plunges downward, through the turf and into the muck below, where monstrous beetles battle and screech -- beneath the Norman Rockwell suburbia lies ugliness and violence . This pretty much captures what the film is going to explore. The film follows Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who discovers a human ear in grass field and proceeds to investigate the case, with the assistance of his girlfriend, the All-American gal Sandy (Laura Dern). It is revealed the ear belongs to the kidnapped husband of a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini); Dorothy's husband and young son have been kidnapped by a man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who's holding them, it appears, as a way to control Dorothy, whom he brutalizes sexually. The deeper Jeffrey digs into the mystery, the closer he becomes to both Sandy and Dorothy and eventually finds he's gotten in over his head, his adventure culminating with a terrifying late-night "joy ride" with Frank and his minions, and a violent, disturbing resolution.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is such an unsettling, disturbing film because Lynch keeps the audience in a constant state of anxiety and fear. We enter the plot through a side door -- the kidnapping has happened already, we don't understand why it's happened, we don't understand the way Dorothy is reacting to it, we don't know who Frank is or even why he's so dangerous (unexplained business regarding Frank, a dirty cop and a drug deal turned deadly only add to the sense that we're actually taking part in a subplot, not the main story). We experience everything through Jeffrey, accepting at face-value that he's a good, clean lad who just wants to try his hand at a little Hardy Boys sleuthing. But once we've identified with him, Jeffrey turns out to be a voyeur with a hankering towards the perverse. He's something of a cipher, a blank slate that could be filled in with either darkness or light -- the darkness being Dorothy, who demands Jeffrey's help yet refuses to go to the police, and who's discovered that she actually likes Frank's kinky violence -- and Sandy, the "good girl" who first appears to Jeffrey out of the darkness, emerging into a warm bath of light, and who shares her dream where "thousands of robins were set free, and they flew down and brought this Blinding Light of Love." The more over his head Jeffrey finds himself, giving in to Dorothy's demands of "hit me" as foreplay and spying on Frank's creepy warehouse headquarters, the more we squirm. Because unlike conventional movie mysteries, we don't know for sure that Jeffrey will save the day and choose the nice girl; like Jeffrey, we're in completely unfamiliar territory, a dark place where bad people don't make any sense, ears can get cut off for no explicable reason, and sex is as grotesque as it is erotic.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a film that truly benefits from many repeated viewings, becoming perhaps even more disturbing as things that were once obscure are better understood. Whether you embrace it or reject it, Blue Velvet is an amazing film, an intimate, surreal, true and distinctive experience. David Lynch's best work to date is the story of a typical all-American USA town where all things seem perfect and normal. That is...until we see what a strange world it is. The boy finds a severed ear in a nearby dirt path on the way to the hospital and sets the story in motion. The cinematography has to be some of the best around, especially noticeable in the opening scenes with the bright pastel colors of the town, the reds, the blues - so vivid - to give you the small town USA look. A detective mystery story told in Lynch's world where the weird only gets weirder. Dennis Hopper in one of his best roles as the wacked-out methyl junkie who holds a child hostage. If you like odd, this is your film. Not for the squeamish. The movie is unforgettable. I first saw it in mid-80s and thought about it for years before I eventually purchased it and viewed it again and again. It has all of the elements of a Lynch masterpiece and certainly all of his films are masterpieces. However, I believe this movie is his crowning achievement. The cast are at the top of their games with this movie. When Hopper yells at MacLahan "Pabts Blue Ribbon" he means it. Hopper summons all his demons up and delivers a nightmare for us all. His baroque " well dressed man" outfit is so disturbing it will jolt you. Rosselini is perfect in her sensual and pathetic moods. Electro shock treatment at its best. ....and his genius is evident in this highly original, artistic masterpiece.<br/><br/>At the time of its release, and even today, twenty-three years later, Blue Velvet is extremely, extremely controversial for its nightmarish, bizarre depiction of sexual attraction between males and females and violence--and deservedly so, for the film repeatedly focuses on a horrific sexual humiliation of the mysterious nightclub singer Dorothy Vallen by the predators that surround her; the rape sequence (which is genuinely horrific and unflinching to watch), her endurance of repeated physical and sexual assault, her sado-masochistic edge that implies a certain complicity in her own abuse are front and center throughout the film and is all deeply disturbing. Strangely, however, the film contains considerably less nudity and graphic violence than one might expect; much of the effect arises more from the on-going dark, surrealistic visuals and disquieting sound effects than from any one single scene.<br/><br/>The cast is remarkable. Laura Dern has seldom been so effectively used in any film as she is here, but the real standouts are Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper; Rossellini was a relative newcomer at the time, but she gives an incredible performance and managed to breakout to stardom because of this film, and Hopper virtually re-invented his languishing career in the role of her psychotic tormentor, winning acclaim and Dean Stockwell's against-type cameo was so startling that it drew tremendous critical fanfare. MacLachlan is also a standout, his wide-eyed expressions and niave nature really comes across in this film.<br/><br/>The film is astonishing. Everything melds together perfectly -- Angelo Badalamenti's haunting, evocative score, the lush visual photography, the masterful symbolism, the performances...it is, overall, a superb experience. Blue Velvet is an extremely important and highly influential film in so many respects that no one seriously interested in film can afford to miss seeing it at least once. Upon returning to his small, seemingly idyllic hometown to visit his sick father, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan, looking a lot like a younger Lynch) finds a severed, decaying human ear in a vacant field. He quickly makes friends with sunny blonde Sandy Williams (Laura Dern, with major 80s hair), the daughter of the detective assigned to the mysterious case. Jeffrey becomes intrigued, and starts an investigation of his own to find out who the ear belonged to.<br/><br/>When I first saw Blue Velvet in 1986, I didn't like it. I was fascinated and shocked and couldn't stop watching, but I didn't "like" it. Now that I've seen it several times, I do consider it one of director David Lynch's masterpieces (my favorite Lynch works are The Elephant Man and the Twin Peaks pilot).<br/><br/>Jeffrey and Sandy's research takes him to Dorothy Valence (Isabella Rossellini, in an amazing, poignant performance), a sultry lounge crooner whose affair with a seething psychopath, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper, who plays the crazy to chilling perfection), leads Jeffrey deep into danger. Blue Velvet blurs the lines between comedy, drama, tragedy and suspense, which makes for an unsettling yet mesmerizing masterpiece. Two of the most well-known neo-noir titles were released in the 1980s, cult flick "Blade Runner" set in a neon-lit, dark future, directed by Alien director Ridley Scott, and David Lynch's suburbia-set "Blue Velvet". The first time I watched Blue Velvet ages ago now, in the early 1990s, my reaction was pretty simple: I really didn't like it all that much. I'd been a huge Twin Peaks fan, loved the funny-quirky characters and stylized-stiff acting, found myself mesmerized by all that weird dialogue and dark beauty. Blue Velvet had all this too, but it also made me deeply, deeply uncomfortable, graphic and Extremely disturbing. Its sadomasochistic, violent sex scenes and bizarre, fragile leading lady (Isabella Rossellini as Dorothy) on the verge of a breakdown -- all that strange freakiness made me squirm and cover my eyes. It took a long time before I could force myself to sit down and watch this supposed classic again. Whether it was just that I was better prepared to be disturbed or just that I'm a little older and no longer demand that all movies deliver barrels of ha-has, this time around, Blue Velvet drew me in. True, its subject matter makes it hard to watch, but its lush aesthetic beauty means you can't take your eyes away no matter how much you might think you want to. And this, of course, is the point: the superficial pleasantness of suburbia has never been stripped away in quite so memorable and vivid a manner.<br/><br/>In Blue Velvet, Lynch makes us look beyond the immaculate green lawns, tidy, cosy homes and apple-cheeked smiling neighbors, and question what all that bland niceness might be hiding - perverted evil. He and his fine cast  notably a positively scary-loony Dennis Hopper (in his most famous role) and a campily wonderful Dean Stockwell  do such a good job of getting us to dig beneath the surface that by film's end, it's those flawless lawns that start to look a little creepy: they're so manicured, so fake, in their perfect prettiness. A lazy popcorn flick this certainly isn't, but there's no question: Blue Velvet offers a truly different take on the same-old tired murder mystery genre, and serves up a thought-provoking skewering of small-town romanticism on the side...something that has spawned a heap of imitators. Some people say that every Lynch film is wonderful, some people think they are all a disaster; but everyone who knows about them goes into the theater and watch them. Maybe this is why he's among the world's most important directors; because you can't skip his work and, whether you like it or not, you can't take your eyes off once you're watching. <br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is not a masterpiece like the recent "Inland Empire" but it is many positive things, and a lot of them would pave the way for what the director does today. The marvelous tale of a disturbing mystery involving a couple of love triangles between the curious Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan), the innocent Sandy (Laura Dern), the evil Frank (Dennis Hopper) and the tortured Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini); "Blue Velvet" is, in my opinion, not a difficult piece to understand, however a tough piece to watch. <br/><br/>It's the announcement of what was about to come, for example "Twin Peaks". The acclaimed series doesn't look like cinema by chance; it stands in the line of "Blue Velvet", where everything we watch affects us but we get it. Actually, I believe there's something bigger in those two Lynch projects. Something bigger than characters or stories or emotions: a vision. <br/><br/>It's a good trick, the one that Lynch performs; making us think that something beyond comprehension is going on when it's really very simple. And it's the rest that is not. It's not simple to view an ear as the portal towards a new world and to experience actions with no specific reasons and not complain. We don't complain because we understand the vision; that's how I explain my admiration for Lynch.<br/><br/>He's so committed to every frame of his work that he transmits that love to us. In fact, all of his actors always comment that he doesn't talk too much; he doesn't really tell them exactly what to do. There is a blind trust that lets Lynch worry more about the environment than about the story being told; this trust is so big that it stops his actors from looking like the puppets anyone would say they are.<br/><br/>In "Blue Velvet" this is a main factor for the success of the film. Isabella Rossellini was merely a model at the time, but her look when she sings and when she softly talks to Jeffrey are qualities of a true actress; while MacLachlan is your everyday college student. Laura Dern is perfect as always and we could consider her the cast's best element, except Dennis Hopper surpasses her. But this doesn't mean he's better; it means he generates a bigger impact. <br/><br/>His character is so full of rage but at the same time seems to hide very profound feelings. He plays it so overacted; he shouts and swears without stopping, but he gets it totally. A normal person would feel tired, but if you understand Lynch you'll comprehend that this exaggeration is necessary. <br/><br/>It would not be Lynch without the eccentric quality; it wouldn't be the same. And remember, "Blue Velvet" is not a movie not to be understood like "Mullholland Drive"; it's a movie not to be forgotten, like any Lynch piece. Blue Velvet is one of the strangest, beautiful and haunting films I've ever seen. I was warned that I'd be watching this at my own risk, but still, I would not have expected what I actually saw. Director David Lynch (whose directing credits also include "Twin Peaks", "The Elephant Man") has imbued this movie with an unsettling yet hypnotic, alluring quality that keeps the viewers eyes glued to the screen, even though they know they should turn away. David Lynch has taken an expose on what lies beneath white-picket fenced suburbia and with Blue Velvet, made it a mainstream subject causing many, many rip-offs (American Beauty, after watching Blue Velvet, does not look at all as original).<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont, a young college man who returns to his small town home after his father is taken ill. Cutting across a deserted field after visiting his father in the hospital, Jeffrey discovers a severed human ear in the field. Of course, Jeffrey turns his find over to the police, however he is so intrigued with the mystery that he begins his own investigation, which unfortunately drags him down into a lurid underworld of depravity and murder.<br/><br/>I'd have no hesitation in recommending this little masterpiece. Sure, its very hard to watch, but it is a rewarding film and becomes a different film on each viewing. The unbelievably brave performances are extremely memorable, the direction is superb, and the film manages to hold up some twenty two years later. Twenty two years on, age still hasn't muted the beauty, pain and timelessness of David Lynch's small-town classic "Blue Velvet". The intensity and stark brutality of the scenes still shock, the beauty is still present, the score is still enchanting and the beautifully saturated colors and visuals and set pieces (notably, Dorothy's apartment) are still dazzling. The plot is quite simply, timeless. Its a coming of age story that combines crime and evokes memories of noir thrillers of the 40s and 50s...the whole setting is reminiscent of a 50's soap opera.<br/><br/>The plot, for those that don't know, follows Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan), who returns to his hometown when his father suffers a stroke, and since this town is the epitome of small town America, it comes as no surprise that Jeffrey would become bored with his surroundings. One day while throwing rocks (which is a sure sign you have nothing going on...and in this sleepy little picturesque town, why would he?) Jeffrey finds an ear. A human ear. Jeffrey turns it in to a police detective he knows, who also happens to be the father of Sandy (Laura Dern), and not content with letting the police handle it, Jeffrey finds out more about the case from Sandy, deciding to find out why a local singer (played to perfection by Isabella Rossellini) has been linked to the investigation, eventually he sneaks into her apartment and finds out more than he wanted to know...<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a film that's ability to provoke, disturb and cause cultural discussion will never cease. It has a film that will remain a highly influential, significant piece of film forever. Why? Because its a masterpiece in every aspect. Blue Velvet is a solipsistic, intransigent, and occasionally ridiculous. David Lynch's classic 1986 fever-dream fantasy of a young college student (Kyle MacLachlan) returned to his small-town roots and all manner of strangeness, is replete with sexual fear and loathing, parodistic inversions (of Capra, Lubitsch), and cannibalistic recyclings from Lynch's own midnight movie cult "Eraserhead" and the flop "Dune". The bizarrely evolving story--MacLachlan becomes involved with two women, one light and innocent (Laura Dern, vaguely lost), the other dark and sadomasochistic (Isabella Rossellini), as well as with a murderous psychopath (a brilliantly demented Dennis Hopper)--seems more obsessive than expressive at times, and the commingling of sex, violence. Still, the film casts its spell in countless odd ways, in the archetype-leaning, flawless imagery, eccentric tableau styling, and moth-in-candle-flame attraction to the subconscious twilight.<br/><br/>Although it tends to be dull and pretentious in some points; its a wonderful, startling piece of entertainment and will undoubtedly burn itself into your memory; regardless if you enjoyed it or not. Perhaps if the violence and bizarre sex didn't seem so distasteful; I'd have gone for a nine or a ten, but for now, its a seven and a half. With Blue Velvet, director David Lynch, who had previously released two distinctly art house films (midnight movie favourite Eraserhead and the mega flop Dune), entered the Hollywood mainstream, although he had found success in 1980 with the biographical drama The Elephant Man. However, the Elephant Man was far from a "genuine" Lynch film. It featured a conventional narrative and was not aided by any surreal images. So therefore, Blue Velvet was his first mainstream success. It had everything "Lynchian" (a term used to describe the style and themes Lynch commonly uses) in it, complicated symbolism and metaphors, psychosexual aspects, the strong use of surrealism to express certain scenes and the unearthing of seamy underworlds under a seemingly idealistic surface.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a film about sickness, depravity and corruption lying under a seemingly innocent and pristine surface. Jeffrey Beaumont, who has been called away from college to come to the aid of his ill father, discovers a human ear in the woods of his hometown of Lumberton. Jeffrey decides to do the detective work himself, and see what he can uncover. Assisted by his virginal sweetheart Sandy Williams daughter of town sheriff John Williams, investigating the case, the two are linked to nightclub seductress Dorothy Vallens. Vallens is linked to drug addicted sadist Dennis Hopper, who is abusing her sexually and holding captive her son and husband. As long as he has these two people, who as we assume mean everything to her, Dorothy will do anything Frank wants, in order for him not to hurt them.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet, despite often being difficult to keep your eyes on, and at the very same time, hard to take your eyes off, is a masterpiece. There has never been a film that impacted so greatly upon popular culture. The imagery is superb, and cleverly combines beauty and darkness, the direction is some of Lynch's best, the score is compelling and adds the films suspense, and the performances are first rate. Just try to imagine the role of Frank Booth without Dennis Hopper. It's impossible. David Lynch is a director who enjoys dissecting smalltown America. This theme crops up in much of his work, but its especially true of Blue Velvet. It sparked a great deal of controversy in 1986 for its graphic depictions of sadomasochism and voyeurism (things not often seen outside of porno theatres), but against the odds, it became a cult classic.<br/><br/>Despite a somewhat disappointing conclusion and maddening plot holes, Blue Velvet is very deserving of its acclaim. Few films settle in with a grip of such compulsive fascination. And that's especially true of the first 40 minutes.<br/><br/>The much remarked upon opening images are quite wonderful the way they set the scene. Glaringly aggressive closeups of white picket fences, beautiful tulips, a blinding blue sky and neatly trimmed lawns. The very epitome of suburban perfection.<br/><br/>But these perfect images are in stark contrast to the sight of a man keeling over with a heart attack. The camera then does something extraordinary by burrowing into the lawn he was watering. It goes past the blades of grass, through the soil, and comes across an insect colony. Crawling over each other. Making as much racket as they like. A miniature microcosm of chaos.<br/><br/>A very subtle message of the American Dream gone sour. Made all the more potent by Bobby Vinton's dreamy Blue Velvet on the soundtrack. The decay hiding beneath the order, waiting to emerge. Corruption that lurks just beneath the shiny surface.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is one of David Lynch's most excellently directed films, especially coming from someone whose work is usually incoherent and distorted. He uses a possible murder mystery as a framing device to get right inside the world of Lumberton, USA.<br/><br/>Another reason why Blue Velvet is one of Lynch's most accomplished films is its apt cast. Kyle MacLachlan is Jeffrey Beaumont, the cleancut All-American Boy who gets in over his head. Laura Dern as Sandy Williams, the Girl Next Door who sets Jeffrey off on the nightmarishly deceptive road to the real Lumberton. Isabella Rossellini in a wonderfully gutsy performance as nightclub singer Dorothy, and Dennis Hopper pulling out all the stops as the crazed, egomaniacal Frank.<br/><br/>When Jeffrey stumbles across a human ear in a field, it propels him into a journey through the darkest recesses of Lumberton. He sees a side of the town he never knew existed, or even imagined.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes are absolutely superb the way each piece of the plot slots into place. There's something wonderfully engrossing when Jeffrey discovers Dorothy's apartment, hides in her closet observing (ogling?) her, and than the entrance of Frank completely throws a spanner in the works. What we at first assumed was Dorothy the murder suspect. Only the film turns convention on its head, and it becomes Dorothy the victim.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal the plot's unfolding rhythms. Its storytelling speaks for itself. But one thing is sure. You will be shocked, amazed and uplifted at all of the right moments.<br/><br/>There are two stories going on in Blue Velvet. The story of Jeffrey's shock and revulsion at the dark side of Lumberton. The second is his seduction by it. By becoming swept up in Dorothy's elegant allure, it brings Jeffrey face to face with the seedy underside of a world he thought he always knew. A world of drugs, violence, rape and S&M. It changes Jeffrey's world forever.<br/><br/>David Lynch's films are frequently bizarre. But in the case of Blue Velvet, this aspect hovers around the narrative in a state of dreamy unease. With the inclusion of Frank's character, this bizarreness begins to punctuate it, taking on a wide variety of bizarre shapes and sizes. None more so than Dean Stockwell's camp queen drug dealer, who delivers an unsettling lip-synced rendition of In Dreams.<br/><br/>Some scenes are deeply disturbing. Frank raping Dorothy. She begging for more. Jeffrey's joyride through the wild side of Lumberton. The way the sick and depraved neighbours with the virtuous is utterly shocking to behold.<br/><br/>Although most people believe the finest performance is from Hopper, I felt that honour goes to Rossellini. The fact that she was willing to put herself through so much humiliation and anguish is truly remarkable. It served to make her plight that all the more horrifying.<br/><br/>But Hopper is excellent too. Frank is a monster. Pure and simple. Hopper knew it, and played the part with zero inhibitions. Its a role that stands just on the cusp of powerful vs hammy. Sometimes Hopper doesn't always recognise the difference, but he intuits Frank perfectly. Its a career making performance.<br/><br/>But despite Blue Velvet's reputation as a classic, I feel it falls a little short of that distinction. Yes its beautifully shot, impeccably choreographed and accompanied to a wonderful brooding score from Angelo Badalamenti. But the kidnapping and murder plot eventually feels intrusive and unnecessary. And Frank is a mystery. Aside from being a psychopath with the bizarre habit of inhaling gas through a mask, we learn little about him. If it weren't for Hopper's brilliant performance, he would fade from memory.<br/><br/>Also the grand finale is not quite as grand as I hoped it would be. Even if its nicely philosophical. Early on Sandy narrates a story about robins putting things to rights. The closing shot of a robin with an insect in its beak seems to reaffirm the status quo. But its an ending of creepy ambiguity. Don't forget. Where there is one insect, there will always be another...and another. The camera sweeps over Lumberton, a charming small, charming American town, with white picket fences, tulip and rose filled gardens, and amiable people. School children cross the road together, a fireman waves while in his firetruck. Jeffrey Beaumont, a college student, has wandered upon a decomposing human ear, buried under over-grown grass, covered in crawling insects. The ear is a completely foreign object in suburban idyll and an alarmed Jeffrey takes it the police. However, he cannot help but proceed with the investigation himself, with the aid of his sweetheart, Sandy, daughter of town sheriff. You know this is asking for trouble. Jeffrey becomes involved with the odd, sexually tormented night-club singer Dorothy Vallens, after she discovers him hiding in her apartment after an unsuccessful attempt in sneaking in. The two are interrupted by a knock at the door, which introduces one of the most vile, sickening villains in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a highly original thriller about seeing things closer, and about the camera as an eye. Jeffrey observes more than he'd like to in Dorothy's apartment. When Dorothy unexpectedly returns, rips the closet door open and orders him out, the boundless terror in his eyes shows him as a peeping-tom caught red-handed. When Dorothy threatens him and even calls him by name, the object has suddenly become the suspect, the subject the object. The voyeur experiences arousal, pleasure, power and fear. David Lynch, director, plays with these phenomena and makes the viewer and makes the viewer the accomplice, but then turns the tables. In Lynch's film, the voyeur is degraded and ultimately, becomes the helpless witness of the brutal and unflinching acts depicted. Blue Velvet is clearly, a very deeply layered and analytical film. The ending, like the opening, is perhaps the most question evoking scene. The fissures have seemingly been sealed in Jeffrey's town, but is this for good, or is it just a temporary respite...<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a must-see movie experience. Even if you cannot handle what the film presents, I suggest you give it a try. The film is a reward experience and unlike many, many thrillers, challenges you to think. A must-see classic! Like my summary suggests (quoting a character from the film), before you watch Blue Velvet, you probably should ask yourself whether you want to go for a ride, because you'll definitely be going on one when you watch the movie. Set in the small town of Lumberton, Blue Velvet deals with the discovery a human ear, yes a human ear. College student Jeffrey Beaumont has stumbled across a rather gruesome human remain that (unbeknown to him) will be the key to an unknown world, metaphorically speaking. An underworld that existed under Lumberton's facade of perfection and idealism, home to sleaze, corruption, murder and drug addiction.<br/><br/>Sounds off-beat? That wont even prepare for the experience Blue Velvet will put you through. Because of its highly original, surreal look at sex and violence in small-town American suburbia, Blue Velvet became one of the most influential films to emerge in the 1980s. And easily, the greatest. Forget E.T., forget Platoon, forget Full Metal Jacket - Blue Velvet is an artistic intellectually stimulating experience like no other and a must see post-modernist thriller that boasts a stunning cast and features superb direction from one of the most distinctive American film makers, David Lynch. When I watch "Blue Velvet" for the first time, I was expecting the average thriller. However, as the film progressed, I knew Blue Velvet was something rare.<br/><br/>David Lynch, best known for this and his hugely popular "Twin Peaks" television series in the 1990s, has crafted a wildly original psycho-sexual thriller/Drama/Crime film about the seedier side of America. This is perfectly summed up in the opening, when beautiful gardens are shown...and then the camera zooms down to reveal crawling bugs.<br/><br/>The ending is something special, and really get's you thinking. When Lynch does a replay of the opening sequence, we know that underneath this façade lies a terrifying reality....something that won't stay buried.<br/><br/>Although the acting is not of a brilliant standard and is probably too wooden and not as strong for such a dramatic film of its kind (Hopper, however, was an exception), I highly recommend "Blue Velvet" if you want a completely original experience, and to see the best films of the 1980s, guaranteed. Probably one of the most incredible, engrossing films in years. David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" is a symbolically rich, masterfully crafted work, depicting the coexistence of two seemingly diametrical worlds with icy and compelling juxtaposition. Beneath the normal, kin- and friendship-oriented world of small town America, Lynch delivers a haunting and terrible (but inexplicably fascinating) world of evil, polarized characters and corruption. The complex relationship between these two realms is unified by a rather simple mystery-detective plot, but, like the opening montage, this ultimately gives way to a premise of greater depth and complexity. Without summarizing plot, one could argue that the central characters in this tableau are representative of each world in some way: Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle Maclachlan), the college student and amateur detective whose seemingly innocent curiosities lead him into the complicated underworld where they evolve into voyeurism and compulsion, someone torn between both worlds; Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), the tormented and physically and mentally exhausted lounge singer whose familial ties to illicit affairs have forced and trapped her in this underworld; Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), Beaumont's all-innocent romantic interest who is willing to help her too-curious friend but remains morally and psychologically rooted in the positive "surface" world; Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), Dorothy's tormentor and blackmailer, and the terrifying, twisted villain who exemplifies the negativity and evil of the underworld.<br/><br/>The relations between these characters serve as the foundation for juxtaposing the two worlds, a contrast which is strengthened by the frequent use of symbols and subtleties (e.g. color and lighting, sometimes surreal placement of characters on the screen, the heavy profanity of Frank). The main underlying idea is certainly a haunting one: behind every facade and every seemingly normal appearance is an existence of a deviant nature.<br/><br/>There are flaws (the plot is rather difficult to assemble), and many scenes are brief, there is plenty of sex and violence, it tends to be somewhat clichéd, yet almost every "great" film has its own flaws. And, like many people, I did not enjoy this on my first viewing. A few years back, it was being shown in the cinemas for its anniversary, and I decided to re-watch it. It had a completely different effect on me. It was like I was watching a different film. Since then, it has become one of my favourite films for its painful but often mind-bendingly beautiful depiction of when good meets bad. Cleancut college man Jeffery (Kyle MacLachlan) finds a human ear in the fields from his Mayberry-like hometown. But then he finds himself involved with a beautiful night-club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and then it's gets deeper, when Jeffery meets a chemical substance-addicted sadist/murderer Frank Booth (Dennis Hooper). Jeffery sees the world of Frank's depraved existence in life. Which he wants to help Dorothy, who's in deeper trouble than he is. Now Jeffery tries to get out in this dark enigmatic underworld, where it seems to have no point of no return of this ordinary man and he tries to make things right before it's too late.<br/><br/>Directed by David Lynch (Dune, Elephant Man, Eraserhead) made a beautiful, disturbing unique exploration of the dark-side of America's Suburbia. The performances here are excellent by MacLachlan, Rossellini and especially Hopper. Laura Dern is also good as Jeffery's curious friend. This is probably one of Lynch's most unique film and it is probably the easiest movie to follow in his work. Rossellini receive a Best Actress Award at the Independent Spirit Awards. Lynch received an Oscar Nomination for Best Director. Too bad, Hooper didn't received an Oscar Nomination for his superb unforgettable supporting performance and Lynch's Oscar Nomination for Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>The Original DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound.

This is a extremely well done movie is not aimed at everyone but if you could handle the strangeness of this original picture, this is a fascinating film that should be not missed.

Blue Velvet at its core, states a simple case: all things that appear perfect are only good in appearance; all things evil are evil through and through. It's about what lurks under picket-fenced normality. You start with the over-Kodachromed shots of a close-knit Americana town with its roses, fire engines, and spotless sidewalks. You conclude with a chirping robin which appears like a puppet, all artificial-like, and David Lynch makes no attempt to make it seem like it's anything but a puppet. In between these elements is evil: a severed ear, shootings, bloodied and battered people, and Frank Booth. This dark world seems much more real than the sunlit Anytown, and this is David Lynch's starting point.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is probably going to be unwatchable for many people: it's violent, it's graphic, it's "weird", etc. But if you get beyond some of the stylization, you will find this film to be a powerful indictment of American society gone mad. It's like both A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, all three films are extremely disturbing and often eccentric, but are wildey considered as being classic films. Blue Velvet is the newest in the league. And as far as movie-making goes, this movie is a magnet for the eyes. This is a visual dans-macabre: stark settings and brash lighting amid the darkness; the contrasting colors; the sweeping camera movements just keep your eyes glued to the screen. Combine this with the brilliant performances of Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, and, of course, Dennis Hopper, and you'll find out why this film endures, even as it nears its third decade.<br/><br/>You don't like this movie? Your obviously living in a childish, fantasy dream world where everything is about surfaces and superficiality. Blue Velvet remind's us that where living in this world is merely apart of fiction. I really like the way that Lynch takes all these noir conventions and twists and toys with them until they're nearly unrecognizable. They're all there - the hardboiled hero, the femme fatale, the monstrous villain - but they're hidden under the director's surreal fantasies and post-modern ideas. Jeffrey's transformation from merely idolizing the famous private dicks to full-on becoming one is genuine and supremely satisfying. Combined with Lynch's superb symbolism and some great performances, it's probably one of the best subversions of the noir genre. Still, I was a little disappointed at the end. After all the praise I heard heaped on this, I think I expected something a bit more. The actual story was lacking - certainly not up to the heights of the great noir works - and made the whole film feel a bit shallow. Overall, though, it's pretty great. When you're a first time viewer of Blue Velvet (or any Lynch film, for that matter) you don't really know what to except. In the film, we are lured into a false sense of security and comfort, and then almost immediately everything changes and a tense atmosphere quickly builds. This pretty much sums up the films superb opening scene. In the film, college student Jeffrey Beaumont and his girlfriend Sandy Williams investigate a murder case that has rocked there seemingly idealistic home-town.<br/><br/>With Blue Velvet, David Lynch challenged audiences to be somewhat of a pervert, peaking through picket-fenced America to expose sadistic sexual violence. Funnily enough, during the film, Sandy asks Jeffrey whether he is a detective or a pervert. The answer is, that both the viewer and Jeffrey are being a bit of both.<br/><br/>David Lynch's magnificent direction is very much present in Blue Velvet. It may be his very best work; along with Mulholland Drive. The performances are exceptional, with Dennis Hopper in his now legendary role as the relentless villain Frank Booth. Isabella Rossellini tackles a risky role perfectly as the battered, sexually tormented night-club chanteuse Dorothy Vallens. Kyle MacLachlan is equally great to watch as the young snoop Jeffrey Beaumont.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet's visionary, highly original take on the darker side of American suburbia can be seen in films as diverse as "American Beauty", although the concept is made more palatable and feel-good, and even Lynch's own "Twin Peaks". The next time you see a film that examines the tension that lurks beneath picket fence normality, think Blue Velvet. For this was the film that began a cliché that Hollywood is still trying to grasp correctly. Ask many people about "David Lynch", and you can be certain that Blue Velvet will come into their head, somewhere along with "Twin Peaks", and maybe "The Elephant Man", not only are these three mediums are his most famous work, but represent some of his best. Blue Velvet is definitely at the top.<br/><br/>In the film, we have our hero Jeffrey Beaumont, who peels through the surface of American suburbia, to find drug addiction, sexual abuse and murder. Blue Velvet is really an age old fable on the triumph of love over evil with a nightmare edge - that was pure Lynch, work he had remade for most of his recent career, but he did it best with Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>As surreal as Blue Velvet may be, it depicts something that is very, very real. Its about surfaces, a tale of good vs. evil.... and it is one of the finest artistic examples you will find of those tales. The reason why Blue Velvet is still so successful with audiences today can probably be attributed to one reason, every film that has tried to imitate Blue Velvet's fable of exposing picket-fenced America's dark side has failed, most of them anyway. That's what makes Blue Velvet so shocking, so intriguing, so nightmarish and so masterful. Only David Lynch could master another film as extraordinary; its easy to see why Blue Velvet caused such a sensation in 1986, and is managing to do so again today. The reason it caused a seismic scandal is because we live in a world of plummeting standards, mindless violence, and gratuitous sex, it's refreshing---and entirely rare---when you come across a major motion picture that the whole family can enjoy. If you're looking for that kind of film, Blue Velvet is more than the mother lode.<br/><br/>It's a slice of small-town life, were everything seems simple, were everyone bakes Apple Pies, watches murder mysteries on television, and likes to keep they're gardens trim and tidy. Its the kind of town were the last murder probably occurred a hundred years ago. Or so you'd expect. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan, David Lynch's muse), who resides in this town, lives with his parents and elderly Aunt Barbara (veteran actress Frances Bay). With his father hospitalized after a massive heart attack, Beaumont stumbles across a mystery at the heart of sleepy little Lumberton. Beaumont teams up with high school sweatheart Sandy Williams (Laura Dern, "Wild at Heart", "Jurassic Park") and Sandy's father---a Lumberton detective---to delve into the mystery that has their little town on edge, and ultimately to snap the cuffs on a gang of dastardly baddies (headed up by Dennis Hopper in a stellar role as the villainous Frank Booth).<br/><br/>Isabella Rossellini (former face of Lancome cosmetics) serves up a particularly memorable role as singer who seems to be on the verge of a mental breakdown, or is in the process of one, Dorothy Vallens, menaced by Booth and his rowdies, who manages to keep up a fighting spirit and lift everyone's spirits with cheerful, all-American musical standards. Grandpa and AMC-fans will particularly get a kick out the film's 1950's musical score, including golden oldies like Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" and Bobby Vinton's yesteryear hit "Blue Velvet".<br/><br/>Blue Velvet also exhibits some flawless cinematography, by Frederick Elmes (who did the camera-work for 2003's "Hulk") shows off the green gables, rose gardens, red curtains, blue velvet gowns, and white picket fences of an all-American town to pristine perfection. I don't think any director has realized the zany human cosmology of a small American town since Sam Wood's 1949 version of "Our Town".<br/><br/>While "Blue Velvet" heads over to the seamier side of town to plumb the more mysterious goings-on, don't fret---Lynch keeps rein over the more frightening elements of this salute to the Heartland. Like any Hardy Boys outing, things may get a little tense, but there's nothing too rough for the tots here, and good wins out in the end. Lynch proves you can put together an all-American classic and STILL manage to have a happy ending, like the latest Disney film, or "Wizard of Oz".<br/><br/>I don't think anyone could remake a film like this today, and if they'd attempt to do so, I'd laugh right in their faces. No-one creates cinematic nightmares like David Lynch, and to this very day, Blue Velvet remains his most terrifying and unforgettable. Lynch is to be heartily congratulated for delivering a film so nightmarishly real you will wonder if you are dreaming with your eyes open.<br/><br/>The film stars Lynch's long-time favorite Kyle MacLachlan (Dune, Twin Peaks) as Jeffrey Beaumont, an extremely polite, seemingly naive and kind young man who returns home from college when his father is hospitalized after a stroke. Jeffrey's home is Lumberton, a picturesque town that looks like it was plucked right out of 50s sitcom. When Jeffrey discovers a severed human ear in a field, curiosity gets the best of him and he sets out on a quest to find out just what an ear is doing in a field.<br/><br/>To reveal much more would take away the mystery and shock which Blue Velvet is so full of. Although it's undoubtedly a Lynchian film, it's devoid of the dreamy fantasy and nonsensical dialogue of such Lynch films as Eraserhead, Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. The story is, more or less, clear, and it's told in typical linear fashion. No doubt this comprehensibility allowed many critics to finally notice Lynch's film-making expertise when Blue Velvet was first released in 1986.<br/><br/>Most of all, Blue Vevlet is a visual spectacle. Its the kind of film that you initially don't imagine to be so grand on the visual scale, but the film is full of Disney-esquire, sort of Wizard of Oz colours (the reds, the blues etc.) are so vibrant and rich. Lynch's attention to detail is amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless. Dennis Hopper's maniac performance rivals that of Jack Nicholson's psychotic behaviour from "The Shining", its got me thinking...exactly were was his Oscar? Many believe that the Academy handed Hopper a nomination for the forgotten Hoisers, when they were really honouring his performance in Blue Velvet, but did not want to take the risk of nominating a highly controversial, dark and depraved film. But take a look at the position Blue Velvet is in today, its become a highly influential masterpiece, while Hoisers is as forgotten as a television movie. Aside from that, Kyle MacLachlan perfectly conveys the innocence of his character, as does the pure girl next door Laura Dern, while Isabella Rossellini captures the fractured and severely abused night-club singer.<br/><br/>Also to note is the stunning score composed by Angelo Badalamenti, who went on to compose every other Lynch film. Badalamenti's score is over-the-top and bold, bringing to mind the music of such classic film noir thrillers such as The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon etc. He is an extremely talented composer, and Blue Velvet is one of his very greatest compositions.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a lush, but dark film that; giving a wonderful emphasis to how strange, brutal and beautiful this world can be, no matter where it happens. From the small town, to the big, looming city. This is a beautiful, well-crafted movie, set up like a stone in a setting by director David Lynch's trademark eccentric lighting. The photography and the sets are gorgeous; the mix of symbols and references and visual styles was daring in its time and the whole experience of seeing it is as much the unrolling of a scroll as it is of watching a movie.<br/><br/>The story looks like a William S. Burroughs adaptation of a Hardy Boys mystery. Small town innocence stumble on a mystery and, gee whiz, they decide to solve it. Instead of buried treasure, it involves electronically amplified sadists crazed by brain-implanted drugs and wearing leather, velvet, lace and rubber fetish suits. There's an occasional mutilated corpse thrown in.<br/><br/>Lynch has not made a better film, this and Eraserhead are his masterpieces. His later career suffered from intense high's and lows, but Blue Velvet makes him (and his work) easier to forgive. With this movie, Lynch succeeds in perhaps the highest single accomplishment art can aspire to (at a human level, anyway): he shows us that, if reality is a dream and dream reality, then we, as both the dreamers and the dream, are the ultimate unfathomables: we are strangers to ourselves.<br/><br/>For a completely unforgettable experience, see Blue Velvet. Blue Velvet may very well be one of the greatest films ever made. It takes you by surprise every time. You don't just "watch" Blue Velvet, you "feel" it. And going into it, the less hype you hear, good or bad, the better. You hear all these things about "it" and when you actually watch "it" for the first time, all that profound analysis or whatever the kids are calling it nowadays can be not unlike a rowdy theater, full of a motley crew of chattering chatter boxes, all making their own shadow puppets on the screen and all in the discomfort of you're already crowded head device mark 12. <br/><br/>Thankfully, I saw this movie just days after it was release. Long before all the hype and acclaim began. When I walked into the cinema, I really did not quite now what was about to happen. I did even now what genre it was. I can say without risk of hyperbole it was one of the most satisfying and powerful cinematic experiences I've had since I was a child (these results are not typical, no refunds.) It seems unfair that the only thing I can give back for that experience is mere praise (we'll try to work on that.) But I strongly urge you to not continue browing the review page, until you've seen it. <br/><br/>After you have seen it, feel free to do anything, you may review it, discuss it with you friends etc. But make sure you've herd nothing good or bad prior to viewing the film. True, there have been some wonderful and thought provoking things said about this film, in it's praise and in it's opposite, but they're not worth you're dime till you've seen it for you're self and have drawn you're own conclusions, and maybe not even then. For me, the film largely stops when the credits run, and I don't need anybody telling me why I should like it or despise it, for I have seen the mountian, and it is good.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those that are looking for an experience like no other. In my opinion, David Lynch's best work. From disturbing undertones heightened by amazing cinematography filled with rich, flourishing colors, alluring mystery and wonder, this highly stylized film noir epitomizes why I love movies; and got into Lynch's work in the first place. Dennis Hopper makes for a disturbing villain (and one of the greatest) and Isabella Rossellini's all at once sexy and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is easily one of the most innovative pictures in years, it captivates the viewer and becomes a different, rewarding film with every viewing. If your looking for a sexy movie, rent something else, because this film is not about exciting sex. Its marketed like that, and people who haven't seen the movie and assume its some kind of sex film have completely misunderstood. But don't let this put you of, Blue Velvet is a masterpiece and is one of my five favourite films. Yes, an undisputed, original classic! You never know what you're going to get into when you see a Lynch movie. But, that's always one of the best aspects about him, I think...<br/><br/>On the surface, this is a fairly run-of-the-mill story line: two young people get caught up in trying to solve a real murder mystery and kidnapping in their own hometown. Golly! Why, that could be something right out of Hardy Boys fiction, right? As the two kids sip their soft drinks and crunch their lollipops (almost), making their plans, it's like Lynch has pulled something from his own teen years and has blown it up into something that, maybe, he would've like to have done when he was Jeffrey's (Kyle MacLachlan) age.<br/><br/>Of course, a murder and kidnapping are just the tip of this murderburg, beneath which there are a whole bunch of nasty things and nasty people that expose Jeffrey and his girl friend, Sandy (Laura Dern), to a world that exists, for them, only in their nightmares.<br/><br/>So, hello, Jeffrey, hello Sandy: time to wake up to the real world!<br/><br/>And Lynch serves it up to them  and us - with a mix of deadbeats, small time crooks, prostitutes, drunks and, arguably, the most chilling sociopath to grace the screen until Hannibal Lechter decided to drop in for dinner in Silence of the Lambs (1991). As Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper gives the performance of his career. See this movie just to see how good an actor he is  and thereafter, you'll be even looking at people you know - or think you know - and wondering...<br/><br/>So, what's Frank's problem, anyway? Well, apart from his need for drugs and sex, he's obsessed with a local chanteuse called Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini). To ensure her eternal devotion to him, Frank's kidnapped her husband and son, thus forcing her to succumb to his depravities. The only poop in the soup, however, is Jeffrey (who symbolizes all young guys who want to know) who decides he wants to know more about Dorothy and bumps into Frank at the wrong moment. Or, maybe it was the right moment because Jeffrey can't stop himself now from finding out even more  about Frank, and Dorothy, and how Dorothy needs Jeffrey and how Jeffrey finds out things about himself that he maybe wishes had remained in his subconscious. Or maybe not? <br/><br/>Because curious Jeffrey persists  the dumb schmuck  just digging himself in deeper and deeper until he discovers the whole truth about poor Dorothy. And, you'll wish he didn't go back to her apartment because the climactic scene when Frank busts into Dorothy's apartment to find and kill Jeffrey ranks as one of the most terrifying sequences on film.<br/><br/>I'll say no more about the story and plot, but I've read that this film has been severely panned by some critics, here and elsewhere, who cannot seem to grasp the point that Lynch is trying to make.<br/><br/>How about this: Nothing Is Ever As It Seems  Even Yourself (and only you know that).<br/><br/>Or what about this: Everybody has the potential for good and evil, and of the best and worst kinds.<br/><br/>Well, being the subversive that Lynch is, my interpretation is that he's satirizing the American Dream, showing how the riches that everybody enjoys has its underpinnings in the dirty and dark underbelly of what everybody thinks is normality. So, what better place to do that than in Small Town America, the backbone of all that's supposed to be good about God's country, the land of the free and the home of the brave? And, everybody's got so used to it, nobody seems to notice  or care, any more...<br/><br/>Maybe some of those critics just didn't like to see such an unpalatable idea on film, if it occurred to them? For my money, Lynch has produced a metaphorical masterpiece that skewers the truth about life in America. But not only in America now, because the American way of life - the good, the bad, and the ugly (just had to use that cliché, didn't I?) - is spreading throughout the world.<br/><br/>So see this movie for that message as well as Lynch's directing, his constant use of extreme closeup and dark darkness, the lyrically moody score by Angelo Badalamenti (mingled with some great standards from yesteryear), and the discordant sounds from Alan Splet; they all combine to produce a film you'll never forget. Promise.<br/><br/>If you like Lynch, this is a must-see. If you haven't seen a Lynch movie yet, start with this one. Among the most critically acclaimed movies of 1986, Blue Velvet was director David Lynch's commentary on small-town America, showing the sordid backside of the sunny facade. That said, the film is not strictly a condemnation of the American small-town so much as it is a kind of coming-of-age story. Lynch described the film as "a story of love and mystery." This statement may ostensibly refer to the relationship between the film's protagonist Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) and the police detective's daughter Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) and the mystery they attempt to solve in plucky Nancy Drew style, but it might also be seen as a statement about the mingling of affection and fear that arises in the movie's examination of the fictional but truthful setting, Lumbertown. One can see Blue Velvet as a coming-of-age story, not only for Jeffrey, but for the idea of the idyllic American small town. The loss of innocence may be regrettable, but is ultimately necessary.<br/><br/>The opening scene summarily characterizes Blue Velvet in theme and plot. Were introduced to a fifties style town, a neat suburban home, complete with a white picket fence, beautiful almost artificial and surreal looking colors, and then, all of a sudden, a man has what it seems to be a heart attack and collapses. The camera sweeps down to a nest of beetles. What these represents is the underworld that a character will discover under a seemingly beautiful and innocently hooky surface. Jeffrey is our hero, and thus the story begins as a rather traditional noir mystery, but the tradition drops away as Jeffrey comes face to face with the most disturbing of people, particularly the demonic kidnapper, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Frank is a killer and drug dealer of almost inhuman proportions and perversions. He alternately calls himself "daddy" and "baby" as he beats and rapes Dorothy, a night club singer whose son and husband have been kidnapped by Frank so she will perform sexual favours for him.<br/><br/>That the story has a reasonably happy ending, with villains vanquished and Jeffrey united with Sandy, is not altogether comforting. The film may return to the bright colors and idyllic lifestyle presented in the opening scene, but the audience now knows that something else goes on below the surface. Jeffrey and Sandy tell each other that it's a strange world, but they say it whimsically, the facade restored for the characters, if not for the audience. Perhaps the most significant scene of the film is when, in his own sexual encounter with Dorothy, Jeffrey strikes her on her command. With the blow Jeffrey crosses over from an innocent trapped in a situation beyond his control to a part of the things that go on behind the closed doors of Lumbertown.<br/><br/>Quite clearly, Blue Velvet was one of the 80s most controversial films. Its full of extreme language, violence and lurid acts of sex. And sparked much cultural discussion over whether it was borderline pornography disguised as art. The Venice Film Festival, for instance, rejected it as pornography. However, the Academy Awards gave Lynch a nomination for Best Director. Over the years, it grew in stature and image and has since become a classic of American cinema. And very deservingly.<br/><br/>The stunning direction of the film combines bald faced directness in presenting repelling scenes of sex and violence with subtle examinations of the mundane and bizarre side of Americana. By slowing the film, for instance, the pleasantness of Lumbertown in the open air seems dreamlike and unreal, a town that only would exist on the cover of a post card or in a 1950s sitcom. While shots like these establish an expressionistic, symbolic screen world, others realistically place us in a situation where we see what the characters see, hear what they hear, and these perceptions form an incomplete picture of the action. Similar techniques crop up in earlier Lynch films, but it is here, in what many consider the director's masterpiece, that they come to full fruition. The direction of Blue Velvet paved the road for the similar world of Twin Peaks, Lynch's first foray into television, which itself widened the possibilities of TV drama.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet reminds us of that, even as it looks back longingly, if now soberly, at the false but comforting memory of a romance with the American ideal. The knowledge of things that aren't really what they initially seem is depicted so amazingly in this film its become a cliché in recent cinema.<br/><br/>All in all, Blue Velvet is a visionary masterpiece and a film that still holds up after all these passing years. In a sleepy American town called Lumberton, young Jeffrey Beaumont discovered a severed ear on his walk back home. He brings the severed ear to the town's head inspector, hoping to find the identity of the ear. On the same night, he met the inspector's daughter Sandy, and the two became private investigators and starts their own investigation. On the way, they met Dorothy Vallens, a lounge singer who is somehow linked to the ear, and Jeffrey falls in love. But when "Dorothy's big man", Frank Booth arrives, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Directed by David Lynch, this film blends in the peace & serenity of 50's America and blends in 80's horror films. Lumberton, like any other town is a representation of a beautiful small town America. There's no racism, robbery, war or natural disasters portrayed in Blue Velvet. But look beneath the town itself, there's a dark & sinister world surrounding it, portrayed by just one man: Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper.<br/><br/>Lynch, who is an imaginary goth auteur manages to give us a homage of 50's film noir in Blue Velvet. Even though his career varies through films like the surreal Eraserhead, the tragic Elephant Man, his hit TV show Twin Peaks, and recently Inland Empire, Blue Velvet still stand today as his best work yet. 2 decades since this film, much of it's influence are still found in today's media, from Desperate Housewives and the X-Files, to modern films like American Beauty and Hot Fuzz. It gives me an impression that Blue Velvet is the grandfather of Desperate Housewives, hence Kyle MacLachan in both.<br/><br/>But what really interests me of this film is the character Frank Booth. Frank is a very scary character who gives the audience a sense of hate towards him. He's a shouting, f- word swearing psycho who uses a oxygen mask whenever he lusts for Dorothy. But, his only moment of calmness is when Dorothy sings a rendition of Bobby Vinton's 'Blue Velvet' at the lounge, a sign that Frank can only find peace through Dorothy.<br/><br/>I believe that Blue Velvet is one of the best films to be made in the 80's. In an era where nuclear war was imminent, the Soviets were having a downfall, and swash-buckling films like The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark were made, Blue Velvet gives a good description of a more peaceful 1980's. And whenever we look at Bush or bin Laden today, we should always remember a quote from Kyle MacLachan's character Jeffrey Beaumont: "Why are there people like Frank in this world?" A college boy named Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan of Twin Peaks and Dune) finds an ear in a field located in a small, tidy town that hits every cliché of Americana. Though he turns the ear over to the local police, he can't resist getting involved, and with the police chiefs daughter Sandy (played by Laura Dern of Jurassic Park fame) in tow as his accomplice he lets his inquisitiveness get the better of him. When he links a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini of Wild At Heart and Immortal Beloved) to the mysterious crime, he's quickly pulled into her perverse world and hopes to be able to rescue her from the mentally unstable rapist Frank Booth (in his most recognized role since Apocalypse Now) A brief synopsis, to be sure, but to say anything more about the film is a injustice to those few who have yet to see it. Some things are better left to be evaluated, especially when dealing with a David Lynch film, which is more of a visual experience than anything else, similar to the work of Stanley Kubrick. Full of rich, dark and beautiful colours.<br/><br/>At times fiercely satirical, yet horrifying and beautiful at others, Blue Velvet is considered by many to be Lynch's best film to date, and with a very good reason. Highlighted by brilliant performances from both Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini, this twisted take on small town secrets remains one of the most influential and original films of its kind, and unquestionably the most distinctive, and well recognized films of the 1980s (alongside Steven Spielberg's amazing E.T.). It has inspired countless movies and television series, even Lynch's own Twin Peaks, as well as the widely acclaimed American Beauty.<br/><br/>Though some feel MacLachlan and Dern are at times dull and lifeless in their roles, I feel that they accurately capture the naivety and innocence that Lynch was striving for when he wrote the screenplay, well Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini balance perfectly as too characters ridden with flaws. Lynch's trademark use of colours, metaphors and symbolism perfectly compliments his cynical world-view, presenting a world that is oft times familiar, but never what we expect.<br/><br/>A darkly comic look at how twisted humanity can become, it really needs to be seen a few times to fully appreciate how much depth this film has to it. Part film noir, part comedy, part thriller, part crime, part erotic mystery, part psychological drama, and part horror film, Blue Velvet is truly a movie that transcends genres and identifying it into one small category is an exceedingly tough task. Lynch so effectively works perverse sexual kinks and disturbing moments of brutal violence into the framework of the seemingly innocent small town of Lumberton. What is so amazing is that after almost twenty three years, it steel has the power to scare and shock audiences witless, perhaps in the manner that the Exorcist did in the 1970s. A artistic masterpiece, no doubt. Anyway you slice it, Blue Velvet is a raw work of art, the masterstroke of an eternal artist, and one scrap of fabric that all should truly experience before they deteriorate. I don't know much about David Lynch. I suppose if I was to describe him, Id call him a somewhat artsy director. A bizarre thinking man with a niche for making mature films. And so far with every movie I've seen of his, this weak description can hold true.<br/><br/>My latest venture into Lynch's world is now with Blue Velvet. I hear many people say "I really liked it, but I don't know why." Not surprisingly, I completely understand that. But I on the other hand, can tell you why I enjoyed it. First off, I love weird movies. And this was a pretty weird film. I could go on a long paragraph summarizing the movie but I'll just simply say it's a bizarre mystery where a young homemade sleuth gets into hot water with an evil pervert who is mentally and physically torturing a woman who the young sleuth believes is connected to his missing ear mystery. How bout that? There's side-stories involving young love and deep emotional issues, but you'll just have to see the film.<br/><br/>To lead the film's bizarre story is Lynch's directing, but not far behind is the acting. You have moments where the acting seems unprofessional, maybe just uninspired. You'll notice these scenes when the tone is lighter. But when the tone becomes serious, all actors change into complete professionals and you really just bask in the amazing acting. Leading the cast is Dennis Hopper. I personally think this is Dennis's best role ever. He was laugh-out-loud funny at moments and then plain disturbing the next. He was ON the entire film, and I really don't think the F word has been spoken so many times with such a few amount of lines. Isabella Rossellini was also really good. She played an incredibly vulnerable and impressionable woman who is doing what she has to do. All the while going almost insane. Dennis Hopper's character Frank rapes and abuses her to extremes where Isabella's character Dorothy has been brain-washed into survival at this point. Even when not being raped by Frank she begs to be hit. I was questioning myself why would she be acting this way if she's not with Frank. But it seems she's so brain-washed into receiving pain that in doing so, she'd be given release because she knew her son would be spared. I think Im right anyways. Lynch's ideas and shots with Isabella's acting were really something else.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a bizarre film, but that's no surprise for Lynch fans. It's well-done on every level. It's meaningful with it's imagery, and it's powerful with it's acting. Fans of Lynch and "artsy" films should really get a kick of this. Blue Velvet is a film about the reality and streams of subconscious desire seething beneath a preposterously idealistic vision of modern America. Jeffrey, a young college student with a streak of mystery, discovers a severed, ant-infested human ear near a grassy trail, bringing it to the attention of the local police chief. With the help of Sandy (Laura Dern), a sunshine blonde girl-next-door who emerges hauntingly from the shadows and promises her devotion to his mission, Jeffrey breaks into the apartment owned by an emotionally frayed chanteuse, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini, doing her best impersonation of a living china doll), and is probably changed forever, especially after Frank Booth (easily cinemas most terrifying villain) enters the scene.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a clever little drama about what lies beneath of all of us. Almost everyone of the characters in this film is hiding something, each of them have a side that doesn't really present it self on your first impression, yet you know something is definitely wrong. Its a film about surfaces. It is certainly a uniquely crafted piece of surrealism that lives up to the work of Dali, and makes Lynch's later career (mostly filled with pretentious hogwash) seem worthwhile. It doesen't matter what mistakes he makes in the future, we'll always have Blue Velvet. Everything about the film is finely crafted, the cinematography, the performances, the soundtrack, all set to the sounds of Angelo Badalmenti's brilliant TV-noir score, which evokes everything from the wide-eyed glee of '50s pop (Roy Orbison and Bobby Devlin, whose "Blue Velvet" was the inspiration for the film) to divine religious hymnals. And the set pieces are wonderful. Even simple things like Dorothy's tidy, small apartment looks amazing. Its full of garish blues and vaginal pinks of Dorothy's kitschy modern apartment; and the cluttered, homely look of the Beaumont home. Jeffrey innocently woes Sandy with an okey-dokey "chicken walk" before the officer's daughter speaks of a dream where darkness fell upon the face of the earth because there were no robins.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet has been one of my favourite films for years, it may not be for everyone (and certainly isn't a film to show to the young crowd), but its certainly worthy of its place as a cinematic classic. Written and directed by David Lynch, this is possibly the only coming-of-age movie in which sex has the danger and heightened excitement of a horror picture. The charged erotic atmosphere makes the film something of a trance-out, but Lynch's humour keeps breaking through, too. His fantasies may come from his unconscious, but he recognizes them for what they are, and he's tickled by them. The film is consciously purplish and consciously funny, and the two work together in an original, down-home way. The setting is an archetypal small, well-kept sleepy city in an indefinite mythic present that feels like the past, and Kyle MacLachlan is Jeffrey, the clean-cut young man who's scared of his dirty thoughts (but wants to have them anyway). He commutes between the blue lady of the night (Isabella Rossellini, who's a dream of a freak) and the sunshine girl he loves (Laura Dern). The movie has so much aural-visual humor and poetry that it's sustained despite the wobbly plot and other weaknesses. Lynch skimps on commercial-movie basics and fouls up on them, too. But his use of irrational material works the way it's supposed to: at some not fully conscious level we read his images. With Dennis Hopper, who gives the movie a jolt of horrific energy, and Dean Stockwell, who is a smiling wonder as Ben the sandman.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was not without its flaws, but it certainly is a movie that should be discussed, analysed and so fourth after viewing as it is an unforgettable experience and one I shall cherish. This is probably the tenth time I've watched this film, heck, it could be more. And quite simply, it gets better upon every viewing.<br/><br/>For me, David Lynch's Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr., often exhilarating experiences, prove maddeningly frustrating by the end, in their wrecked plunge into obscurantism. What the hell is going on, and just who is he/she suppose to be? In contrast, Blue Velvet, what many (including myself) consider Lynch's abiding masterwork, offers a story which, though a trancelike journey into the most eerie of netherworlds, somehow makes a crazy sense, beginning to end. Blue Velvet is, genuinely, what dreams, or more accurately nightmares, are made of. Actually, its probably a combination of both.<br/><br/>Lynch takes an old-fashioned, kind of Alfred Hitchcock style investigation story, adds a some of the neo-noir touch. Jeffrey, a young college student, is at the centre of this mystery. He has discovered a human ear in the woods, and suspects there is a mystery hidden somewhere under his home town of Lumberton. His high school accomplice, Sandy, plot to uncover the hidden crime and solve it. It's Frank Hardy meets Nancy Drew, and, gee, what fun! Bypassing the police, a confident Jeff, checks out the apartment of a frail and confused lounge singer, a purged from Wizard of Oz Dorothy Vallens. He discovers that her child has been kidnapped. The Dali-esquire ear? It's been sliced from the head of her husband, who is captive of Frank (a deliriously out-of-control Dennis Hopper at his very best), a drug addict and psychopath.<br/><br/>Much in the vein of Hitchcock's Rear Window, here is a film which implicates the filmmaker as the ultimate voyeur. Again and again, Jeff (as does Lynch's film) climbs the stairs to that apartment, where there's sordid and often violent sex, an often naked woman asking for it, and, finally, blood and death.<br/><br/>More than a decade and a half later, Lynch's landmark piece of bizarro cinema still holds up as a masterpiece, still as fresh and horrifying as it was the world back in 1986. Isabella Rossellini's raw, damaged performance as the near-suicidal Dorothy still seems one of the most vulnerable and courageous ever by an actress. Where was here Oscar? Where was Hopper's Oscar....? Wait, were was the Best Picture Oscar? Some many films today are widely regarded as classics; yet never took anything away from an Oscar ceremony, Blue Velvet is easily one of them (although it was nominated).<br/><br/>I'm going to conclude in saying that Blue Velvet may be one of the most jolting film experiences you'll ever have, and certainly one of the finest. And now for a tip, watch it with your friends, not alone! It has taken me a while to get around to reviewing this film, but now the opportunity has come along, I'm glad I have. Let me start by saying that I've never experienced a film that I still cannot forget eight years after I've seen it. I can still feel the reaction I had to certain scenes, and then when the credits roll. To say at the most, the film is extremely powerful. The directing is superb, the camera work, the visuals, the symbolism, the soundtrack, the score, Dennis Hopper's unforgettable performance.<br/><br/>And now to say at the least, its one of those movies I could watch over and over again and never really get tired. The film is so deep and layered that you notice something new every time you watch it. To be honest, the first time I saw the film, I thought it was good, but certainly not great. I thought it was extremely overrated, and had an immense dislike for Lynch, especially his work. But one day, I decided to pick the film up again and take a look. And it didn't take me look to come to the realization that this movie is a masterpieceBecause of my warm reaction to the film today, I am far more open to Lynch's films and have accepted "Mulholland Dr." (2001) as being a good film, heck, its great. But Blue Velvet is, easily, his best work.<br/><br/>I'd try to pick my favourite thing, but that is as hard as asking me to choose whether sex is better than chocolate. There are just too many: from the In Dreams karaoke scene, Jeffery witnessing Frank and Dorothy's first encounter from the closet, the mesmerizing opening scene, the ending, Dorothy's rendition of Blue VelvetI could do this all night.<br/><br/>Arguably, Blue Velvet is one of the greatest films ever made. Every time I watch it, it see that it's a piece of surrealism that matches the work of Dali, it is a beautiful piece of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody. It's a masterpiece that should be treasured. Blue Velvet, one of David Lynch's most noted and well-known films, centers small-town kid Jeffery Beaumont, who makes a gruesome discovery in his dreamy town of Lumberton, USA, which embroils him into an ever-spiraling murder mystery that involves the sick, mentally unstable rapist Frank Booth and his hostage Dorothy Vallons. Blue Velvet starts off, and progresses much like an Alfred Hitchcock film. The film is full of edge-of-your seat thrills, twist and turns, shadowy noir cinematography and depth as well as an artistic stroke while still managing to be entertaining. Upon your initial viewing, it seems like a simple erotic thriller. It doesn't take many repeated viewings to discover it's a complex, absorbing piece of American surrealism.<br/><br/>The performances are astonishing, particularly that of Isabella Rossellini. Who deserves kudos not just for her performance, but for her courage to take on a role many actresses famously passed on but probably desire today, looking at the status of the movie. Frank Booth gives the performance of his career, and manages to be all-too convincing it's scary to watch.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a movie landmark that's impact has, and undoubtedly will continue to reach beyond its own era. Even though writer/director David Lynch probably never intended it, critics in 1986 saw in Blue Velvet a reference to Reagan-era politics: insidious and underhanded behavior covered up by a colorful and squeaky clean surface. Now Blue Velvet has been dusted off and restored just in time for the second act of the Bush era, and it still fits. And even though Blue Velvet can work on that political level alone, it goes much deeper. Its mysteries travel the four winds, and many of them will never be solved.<br/><br/>In any case, Lynch's fourth feature film was and still is a bona-fide masterpiece, one of the few such films that was actually appreciated in its time and has perfectly weathered the 21 years since. The story has college student Jeffrey (Lynch favourite Kyle MacLachlan) coming home from visiting his ill father, who had suffered a heart-attack. Wandering through a field on the way home from the hospital, Jeffrey finds a severed ear. He brings it to the local police detective (George Dickerson), whose pretty blonde daughter Sandy (Laura Dern) lets Jeffrey in on a few more sordid details.<br/><br/>Apparently, a local singer, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) is mixed up in something sinister that may connect to the ear. Unable to control his curiosity, Jeffrey sneaks into her apartment and witnesses a disturbing scene involving possible kidnapping and blackmail by a psychopath named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).<br/><br/>Jeffrey continues digging into the crime and basically finds himself deeper and deeper in the mire. He hits rock bottom when he runs into Frank in the flesh. Frank takes him on a scary odyssey into the night, which ends in a disturbing display of violence. But in the morning, Jeffrey is far more disturbed by the violence he found within himself. In some ways Blue Velvet is denser and darker than Lynch's 2001 masterpiece Mulholland Drive. Even focusing only on its glistening surfaces and scary subsurfaces, the film delivers a rich pastiche. The idyllic "Lumberton" where the characters live is presented as a parody, with the local radio station giving the time "at the sound of the falling tree" and characters speaking to each other in awkward, carefully controlled dialogue. Is everyone happy here, or is this how "they" want us to be?<br/><br/>By contrast, Frank's world seems so much more fun. Like Stanley Kubrick in A Clockwork Orange, Lynch makes the underworld look like a scream at first. He lures us into it willingly before he brings the hammer down. The movie's most quotable lines are all Frank's: "What kinda beer you like, kid? Heineken! F--- that s---! Pabst Blue Ribbon!!!" (Even that line reeks with a kind of Reagan/Bush Americanism -- either you're with us or you're a stinkin' Commie.) But at the film's end, when the evil has been defeated, what's left? Sandy's dream of Robins representing all the love in the world comes true, but in the form of a fake mechanical robin -- with a worm in its mouth.<br/><br/>Indeed, Lynch constantly toys with us. Almost every scene is ripe with some kind of hidden meaning. When Jeffrey first goes to Dorothy's apartment, the elevator is broken and Jeffrey has to climb several flights of stairs. Lynch includes a handful of other shots of characters climbing stairs as well. Usually this symbolizes either a descent into hell or a climb to heaven, but Lynch reverses these meanings. To what end? An emotional response, most likely, a way to make us feel even more off-balance than we would watching a traditional film noir.<br/><br/>That's ultimately Lynch's storytelling mode of choice: film noir. He's interested in the dark places, the nightmares that make people squirm. It's in their squirming that people reveal themselves; they become truly alive. Which is why one of Frank's favorite things to say is: "now it's dark."<br/><br/>I discovered the gem on video and laserdisc in the very early 1990s -- and saw it at least a dozen times in that format, I forced my friends to watch it, who have never been the same since (when it comes to films). Seeing it for the first time on the big screen, though, I discovered new clues and new mysteries. And Blue Velvet is just as great now as it always was. A masterpiece. Blue Velvet is probably one of the greatest American movies ever made.<br/><br/>Even the Oscar winning American Beauty has borrowed its brilliance. The Velvet touch is clearly evident in the cinematography. The term post modernism is used so loosely these days, David Lynch however secures the winning title of a post modern piece of film. A mixture of narcotic fuelled sex and violence, drugs and alcohol abuse contrasted with the aesthetics of a 1940/1950's exterior. The stranger would think nothing of this beautiful little town within America but look through the voyeuristic eyes of Jeffrey and you will be sucked into a world not even you could imagine. A world that only exists in your worst nightmares. This film isn't for the faint hearted but is a genuine masterpiece from the movie genius that is David Lynch. There is no mistaking the fact that Blue Velvet is one of the most exhilarating, original movies for years. Heck, it may even be one of the greatest ever made, in its own right. The film has a brilliant introductory sequence that had me hooked and one that sets the best for what is to follow. The place it is set in is Anywhere, USA, or actually Lumberton, however the place could quite easily be anywhere, an ideal haven, where everything is so perfect, it almost qualifies as being surreal. With Bobby Vinton and Roy Oribison on the soundtrack, Mr. Lynch presents us blue skies, trim flowerbeds, and sweet little houses of suburbia that is obviously hiding under a deceiving surface. And minuets after the opening, after a man watering his garden collapses from an apparent seizure, the camera swoops down under neat, weed less lawn to observe the teeming hordes of insects living in the dirt. And know we know that something is lurking, waiting to be exposed.<br/><br/>Figuratively speaking, the film needs to remain at a bug's eye level for nearly two hours until it is ready to return to the surface for an ironically sunny coda. And if the sheer creepiness of that first descent seems a hard act to follow, Mr. Lynch is more than up to the challenge. As he superbly proved in his earlier, experimental nightmare Eraserhead (1977), set in the ruins of a decaying apocalyptic world. Once our films neo-noir style hero, Jeffery Beaumont discovers a human ear in a grass field at the beginning, we know there is one weird episode to follow, propelled by the logic of a nightmare or horrific dream. These forays seem to grow even longer as the film progresses. Blue Velvet is overloaded with these kinds of piquant little details that would stand up brilliantly on repeated viewings which it has undoubtedly received over the years, making it superbly layered and full of meaningful depth.<br/><br/>The film is so scary; it seems as if it is some kind of nightmare plucked from Salvador Dali. One of the scariest, most intense scenes (and there are many) comes half way through when Jeffery is led into a woman's apartment while investigating the case of the missing ear. Here, he watches, through a cupboard, a woman being sadistically tortured by the inimitable Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth. And that is where it starts; another scene to follow features an unstable Frank watching his accomplice in crime, Ben lip synch to Roy Orbison's haunting In Dreams. It has basically turned an innocent, pop song into some nightmarish tune.<br/><br/>For those with the temerity to follow Blue Velvet anywhere, the film is as fascinating as it is freakish and is easily going to garn an argument or debate long after viewing. It also confirms its director as a pure inventor, superb technician and one of the greatest American directors in many, many years.<br/><br/>There has to be some bizarre conspiracy that this film is not on the Top 250.... it will get there, soon. Blue Velvet has been considered one of the greatest movies ever. It is constantly put on both critics and audiences top 10 lists. It has become one of the most well known 1980s films. <br/><br/>But it isn't really that amazing or groundbreaking, there is loads of sexual violence which make it frightening, but this shouldn't make a movie memorable. For reasons that escape me, Lynch has ardent followers and fans of this film. Upon an initial viewing, it appears to be an entertaining, masterful thriller but re-watching the film, there is nothing to re-discover.<br/><br/>It is visually striking (beautiful images abound now and then), but otherwise it's hollow and pretentious. David Lynch's 1986 cult classic thriller could easily be the 1980s answer to Hitchcock's Psycho. Sure enough, both films redefined the thriller genre and caused and outpour of controversy upon their release. And both films hold up superbly years after there release, none have aged.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is perhaps one of the most iconic, analyzed films of the eighties. And it is one of the few films to get away with gratuitous sexuality and extremely violent content. It escaped the trap of being considered a marginal art house cult, and escaped being labeled a forgotten successit has become a highly regarded masterpiece, and is widely seen as Lynch's best film. The performances are incredible, and theirs an evil charm that Dennis Hopper has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly...its almost scary.<br/><br/>Some people have knocked Blue Velvet for its violent content, however (like Psycho, once again), it has escaped this tag and people can see that the violence is essential to the plot. Blue Velvet is one of my favourite movies of all time, despite the fact it took me three viewings just to realize how phenomenal and genius this film really is. This is the story of a the discovery of an underworld existing under the surface of an All-American town home to happy suburban families and perfectly manicured gardens. After a young man, Jeffery Beaumount, discovers a human ear, the innocence is all of a sudden taken and evil takes over.<br/><br/>The film is interspersed with lots of bizarre images designed to evoke some incredible emotional response. Some of these are really weird, funny and visually exciting and are way too many to discuss here. However, after a while it seemed like all this weird aspects really tended to distract from the central story and made the movie very long and a bit pretentious.<br/><br/>I actually took the trouble to see this movie twice--once when it first came out and now again, more than twenty years later. While I loved the movie when it came out, and loved the ride it took me along, I thought I'd try again as my tastes in films has definitely evolved and changed incredibly since then. Unfortunately, while I appreciate much of the film, I still don't see it as the artistic masterpiece many film goers proclaim it to be. On the positive side, director David Lynch made a film that is very unique--something you'd never see Hollywood make. I can respect that as well as the film's unusual artistry.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an amazing film to see (full of amazing images and a bravo opening shot that is enough to wrap anyone around its finger) but one that left me feeling a bit empty. The performances are quite simply amazing, the film however, is a mixed bag overall. Most movies tell a story, some do it well, some don't, some even don't have a story at all, and even less do it in a way that's not only breathtaking but also highly insightful and at the same time frustrating. David Lynch ("Mulholland Dr.", "The Elephant Man", "Twin Peaks"), as ever, unfolds a masterly conducted, Technicolor dream-world which lies at the border between the obvious and the unknown. He permeates this border not by preaching, not by explicit over-talk or demystification, he looks at it and presents us just that: A glance into the abyss, and at the same time, a glance into the brightest and finest light of humanity. With Lynch, both belong together and flow into each other, both gently and brutal, both discreet and surreal and shockingly realistic.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet begins and ends with an outlook at a paradisal, bright and happy front view of life in a Middle American small town - framing it into titles with a blue velvet background. Then unfolds a strange and dark world as Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) finds a human ear which leads him into a bizarre, sexually depraved underworld home to a wide range of characters. A femme fatal Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossallini) and the personification of evil, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). The theme playing out here is paralleled by some of Lynch's other works, like "Mulholland Drive", Twin Peaks, "Wild at Heart" and '"Lost Highway", while it looks a bit different in his earlier works like 'Eraserhead' and 'The Elephant Man'.<br/><br/>While there are always major sexual undertones, nothing we see is just what it appears, surfaces don't always represent what they really hide. And so, amongst scenes which might indicate this being a usual erotica crime thriller, sequences are built in that make this something greater, something entirely different, a truly original film in every sense of the word. Characters become symbols, the lines between characters disappear even - Jeffrey and Frank might be the antagonists, but Jeffrey most of all is opposed to Frank because of the influence he feels coming from this madman - because the madness and evil of Frank is already lurking inside of himself, he is not just fighting another man but more like the very idea of him, the very concept of darkness. It could even be a film noir from the 40s. The genius of Blue Velvet is that it is not a film that can be easily categorized. Its almost like a painting, albeit one by Salvador Dali or a story by Frank Kafka. But clearly, Lynch's own vision has succeeded successfully at its goal, whatever it was. Blue Velvet was a film that was initially met with much controversy and criticism upon its release, but today has become a film that is deeply appreciated and frequently studied and imitated. It is certainly a film that deserves my appreciation. Here, we are presented with film making in full circle. It proves to be one of the most terrifying, beautifully compelling films I have ever seen, and I have seen many films.<br/><br/>This film builds to a shattering crescendo of tension, with the explanation very logical, depending on one's interpretation. The road from unease through fear through genuine horror has seldom been so ably traveled, and if one's complaints that the picture is raw and technically crude are true, then are you actually aware that violence and corruption like this exists pretty much everywhere? Blue Velvet is both extremely realistic and surreally dreamlike at the same time. It is as complex as a dream, or a painting. This movie should be required viewing for those that can handle films with confronting and dark content, as Blue Velvet battles it to the extreme. It is a thought-provoking, disturbing and awe-inspiring nightmare into the dark side of America. David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness like no other film has dared to. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor masterpiece picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree, lamp-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare in a town were innocence is constantly assumed and predicted.<br/><br/>After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score. Blue Velvet is a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality, and has made a profound impact on movie-goers because of this. And it actually is worth the hype.<br/><br/>And it hasn't aged. I saw this in the cinema years ago, thinking, this is a film that is going to create a major stir. And it dad, and years on, it wears extremely well. The kudos that were directed to Blue Velvet are very much deserved but the film viewer should be warned; Blue Velvet is an extremely graphic film full of emotional violence and bizarre, provocative and extremely daring images. Ironically, Blue Velvet was one of Lynch's most successful films, commercially and critically (and certainly truer to his vision than The Elephant Man) -- along with 2001's Mulholland Dr. and 1980's roaring success Elephant Man. When Hitchcock mined similar terrain with Vertigo he found an unresponsive audience. When it was first released, Blue Velvet provoked as much as it entertained; the bizarre, surreal and overall masterful opening sequence by itself makes the audience sit up and take notice. It sure did me.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+ This must be one of the greatest movies of all time. I found myself almost in a state of shock and awe during the whole movie. Everything was perfect. The story was great, so simple yet so intriguing, the filming was pure genius and the originality was almost breathtaking. The film possess a unique erotic power that takes it away from being sleazy, but makes it beautiful and masterful.<br/><br/>It is director David Lynch's disturbing, sensual, sickly funny masterwork Blue Velvet  his defining film  fascinated and repelled audiences on its release in 1986, and undoubtedly has left a lasting impact on both audiences and critics. Closer in tone to his freaky first film Eraserhead than to either his mainstream debut The Elephant Man or his follow-up fiasco Dune, audiences were simply unprepared for the experience. Although Lynch's distinctive style has become recognizable and less shocking over the years (and served as inspiration for such diverse directors as Quentin Tarantino, Jim Jarmusch, Todd Haynes, Gus Van Sant, Todd Solondz, Terry Gilliam, and the Coen brothers), at the time of its release it was stupendously shocking because there had never been a mainstream Hollywood film even remotely like it...it was the 'Psycho' if its time.<br/><br/>The film centers clean-cut college student Jeffery Beaumount, who has recently found a human ear in a grass field while walking home from visiting his ill father in the hospital and discovers that beneath the Norman Rockwell suburbia lies ugliness and violence that is capable of corruption and destroying the towns innocence, once home to fresh-faced urchins who stay in the crosswalks, firemen merrily wave from their hook-and-ladder truck, red roses line brisk, white picket fences, and neighbors enjoy the blazing sunshine as they hose down their impossibly green lawns. The underworld eventually reveals some bizarre and depraved characters, one of whom, the beautiful Dorothy Vallens, is brutalized sexually by the man the kidnapped her husband, Frank Booth. The lethal adventure leads Jeffery to a violent, disturbing resolution and confrontation between the seemingly unstoppable Frank Booth.<br/><br/>Repeated viewings of Blue Velvet will help first-timers, as it will become perhaps even more disturbing as things that were once obscure are better understood. Insane, ultra-violent Frank Booth, sucking God-knows-what from his oxygen mask and screaming "Baby wants blue velvet! Baby wants to ^%#@!" is a man in love  as he watches Dorothy sing the title song in a run-down nightclub, he gently fondles the square of fabric that he cut from her robe when he sexually assaulted her earlier, tears running down his cheeks. This is amazing, and should be appreciated as a real masterwork in cinema history. Just take a look at its influence. The 80s was a decade home to cinema that evoked a MAJOR impact on the public, some of who may go with the operatic grandeur of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial  one of the most beloved films of all time has become today's counterpart to the Wizard of Oz, or the film that commercialized the term given to a highly dependent femme fatale who will stop at nothing to gain her perfect man ("bunny boiler"), which was of course Fatal Attraction, or others may go with one of the most controversial pieces of cinema, Blue Velvet. Or then there was the film that put Bruce Willis on the map, Die Hard. All films have caused a multitude of discussion among critics and audiences alike. Blue Velvet will always be the winner for me. Obviously, there are many great movies, but personally, Blue Velvet has cast a spell over me. There are so many amazing aspects to the film. Other fans have commented here on the story and the spellbinding way that the forlorn and utterly mysterious story unfolds. I certainly agree. Then there is the cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score. But the puzzling thing about "Blue Velvet" is that for all of its visionary panache, almost none of it sticks in your mind. Some might see this as a sign of what's elusive in "Blue Velvet," but it's more about what's trivial in it.<br/><br/>At its very best aspect, "Blue Velvet" showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents. There's an able assist from cinematographer Frederick Elmes' moody, innovative lighting and Patricia Norris' offcenter production design (it reveals neither time nor place), but the vision is always Lynch's--an eccentric collage of comic books, pulp fiction and dada. We see the deceptive surface of a small American town, with a series of simple images, red roses and with teal blue skies, all flattened with fake nostalgia. The calm is then shattered and we see a man fall the ground from a seizure and the camera zoom under grass to show a nest of bugs fighting viscously. Lynch is behind the amazing experience. He is someone that has the mind and creativity of Fellini, but instead, his imagination overruns his skill. Blue Velvet reunited Lynch with a terrain of his own, after the commercial disaster Dune, which he had little, to no artistic control over. Many will see Dune as a masterful science fiction film, but it simply doesn't have the Lynch touch. Yes, Blue Velvet is a bizarre movie, but that is what distinguishes it from the typical boring, and tacky films we see today. Blue Velvet was the last good American film that truly meant something. And none of its shock value is delivered for its own sake, it inhabits total authority. A film that demands respect, and gets it, purely because it deserves it. David Lynch's haunting Blue Velvet is a compellingly graphic psychosexual drama into the macabre and dark. It is a surrealistic tour-de-force like no other, and captures some of them most breathtaking images and sounds in cinematic history. Namely, toward the end of the film, an artificial, almost mechanical looking robin appears on a window ledge to represent the overall artificial quality of the world, playing up the superficiality of small town life while celebrating its sentimentality. There is also a clever use of metaphors, in a scene in the fantastically shot opening, the camera descends around a neat and tidy front lawn, only to zoom down under the grass to show a pack of swarming beetles engaged in to death as ominous noises accompany the horrifying images to represent the underworld that exists under Lumberton's seemingly perfect, hokey, suburban surface.<br/><br/>But this is the only stroke of genius in Blue Velvet. It takes a simplistic plot and turns in upside, flooding it with shockingly explicit sexual episodes and graphic violence, the draws a distinction from the typical Hollywood thrillers of its kind which display no depth whatsoever. Break away from those films, and prepare to experience a film that shaped Hollywood and spawned countless imitators which merely swim in its wake. As an amateur film critic myself, having seen countless movies in my lifetime, I urge you to see Blue Velvet on multiple occasions as it's almost impossible to grasp a film like this on the initial viewing. One of the most talked about films in recent memory was marketed with the very appropriately fitting tagline "It's a strange world" -- an artificially nostalgic world that David Lynch depicts of neighborly neighbors, friendly dogs, of red roses growing against a white picket fence, a clear blue sky, and the neat suburban homes that are shown in the beginning and at the end of the film. There are also the cheerful sounds of the radio DJ announcing the time "at the sound of the falling tree." It is a town that, by a first glance, you'd certainly want to live in. There is also a dark side to life that David Lynch (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, THE ELEPHANT MAN, TWIN PEAKS series) wants to show you as the underbelly of a small town, and that's what gets explored in this original American film, a film that actually means something.<br/><br/>Jeffrey is a typical college-aged man returning to his home town of Lumberton, after his father had a stroke and he must run the family hardware store. The day-to-day routines of suburban family life changes for him when he picks up a decomposing human ear in a field and immediately takes it to the police, where he is aided by Detective Williams.<br/><br/>Jeffrey soon meets Detective Williams' harmless, girl-next-door teenage daughter, Sandy -- outside her house and she intrigues him by mentioning that she overheard her father talking about the case and that they are investigating the nightclub chanteuse Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who resides in a 7-story apartment in the neighborhood. Jeffrey feels adventurous and romantically inclined toward Sandy and talks her into showing him the her apartment after Sandy devalues as much info possible. Jeffery then goes a step further and devises a plan to sneak in and observe her apartment.<br/><br/>Days later...Jeffery finds himself hiding in the slatted closet after he returns home while he is in the middle of investigation, Jeffrey gets an eyeful of the mysterious, beautiful singer parading around in panties and bra, and sees her have one of the weirdest sexual encounters ever in a commercial film. Deranged gangster Frank Booth enters her apartment and begins a sadomasochistic tryst with her while he screams bizarre obscenities while he rapes her. And this is just the beginning of Jeffery's entrance into a place that he thought didn't exist.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet sure sticks with you years after you've watched it, and has had a very powerful affect on myself. Hopper is funny and menacing in one of his all-time best over-the-edge roles. He is the energy of the film, and has outrageous lines like: "let me f*ck everything that moves!" In what goes for conversation, he asks MacLachlan: "What kind of beer do you like?" MacLachlan: "Heineken" Hopper: "f*ck that ^%$#, Pabst Blue Ribbon!" Rossellini was amazing, and commanded by attention throughout the entire film. She shattered the constricting perception as being the daughter of screen-legend Ingrid Bergman (CASABLANCA). Whether you enjoyed this film or not, it goes without saying it deserves its reputation as a landmark in cinema history. It isn't something that will appeal to everyone, but it deserves the credit it gets for being simply an excellent film. I can not think of a movie from the 80s that has made such a lasting impact on critics and audiences, maybe E.T. The Extra Terrestrial or Empire Strikes Back, but another film fails to cross my mind. The rest have all been submerged and sort of disappeared and overshadowed, saying a lot about how well they age. Blue Velvet has always been a strikingly original art-house film, and perhaps the most successful. And for years, it has been one of my favourite films, sitting firmly on my top 5.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" is a simple amateur sleuthing story, but the genius is in the telling of it. It's hard to avoid the feeling that something supernatural is somehow involved, although it isn't, and we know that it isn't. There is a clear line between the good and evil, and the story unfolds into a fabale that becomes an intense battle of the good and evil, and the characters caught in between.<br/><br/>It is Lynch's most appealing effort, too. Mulholland Dr., Eraserhead, Lost Highway weren't intricate films, and that is why not as many seem to enjoy the later, the former however, has become one of the most acclaimed works in the 2000s thus far. Eraserhead is an expressionist picture, so it clearly isn't going to evoke the same response from every viewer. A film like Blue Velvet, however, appears to both the fans of Lynch's more incoherent work, and the fans of more conventional films. The film is visually arresting, showcasing some of the most perfectly choreographed and shot films of all time. David Lynch's Blue Velvet is on the surface, a journey into the surface of American small-town life. But it is also a journey into the subconscious or a place where things you don't like confront you, and sometimes corrupt you. With the appearance of the ear in the grass, the director shatters the seemingly idyll and makes a conscious allusion to Salvador Dali's "Un chien Andalou" (1929). Lynch, clearly, embraces the surrealist tradition, the artistic movement that articulated the strongest aversion to any form of "normality", while attacking overly naive conceptions of what constitutes reality. But rather than focusing on quotations, we should examine the more substantial problem of surfaces. Surfaces reveal as they slowly conceal, showing some very sinister forces when the surfaces has been broken, as is the case in this masterpiece of cinema.<br/><br/>Jeffery Beaumont, a young man discovers a human ear, and after little aid from the police, investigates the possible clues himself. Jeffery takes on the high-risk role of detective/snoop, and with his friend Sandy Williams (daughter of the local sheriff), decides to sneak into a suspects apartment. The thought of forcing his way into this woman's private sphere arouses him more than he will admit to himself, let alone Sandy. While in her apartment, the woman returns, and Jeffery must assume the role of a peeping tom by hiding in a night-club singer's closet and watches a very voyeuristic act of violence take place right in front of his eyes. This establishes a recurring motif that Blue Velvet is a film about seeing what is not usually visible to the naked eye. He slowly digs deeper into a bizarre, depraved underworld, home to depraved sexual violence (some of the most disturbingly graphic depicted in cinema) and substance abuse, we meet what is commonly referred to as a "femme fatale", the nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens. She isn't a clear femme fatale, but an accidental one. She unknowingly holds Jeffery in a very dangerous position, which is what gives her the particular label. Then we have our villain, one of the most evil on screen, Frank Booth. This sets-up a very original noir atmosphere. And one of the best, at that. I don't want to reveal the thrilling moments that progress in Blue Velvet; you simply must experience it yourself.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet easily makes its way on my top film list, along with classics such as Pulp Fiction, 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Tokyo Story and The Godfather 1 & 2. But there is something that distinguishes Blue Velvet from these films. It is a mesmerizing original, uniquely crafted experience that has left an undisputed mark on both the reviewer and cinema overall. All these years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime, but none as dangerously imposing as this.<br/><br/>The opening sequence in this 1986 noir classic is alone worth the price of the disc. The scene is that of an outwardly idyllic American town, a small white house with requisite garden and white picket fence, and a middle-aged man serenely watering his lawn. The man has a sudden stroke and falls to the ground. The camera moves in close on the man, then to the grass beneath him, then beneath the grass to the sight and sounds of black beetles gnawing and clawing their way through the earth. It's the movie's plot in microcosm.<br/><br/>Like many another film, "Blue Velvet" explores the notion that life is not all that it appears. Under a veneer of respectability, evil lurks in the most seemingly harmless places. Just below the placid surface of every community lies the face of horror.<br/><br/>It may be extravagantly excessive, but it's brilliantly alive and innovative, too...like very few films are. Fans should rejoice Blue Velvet as one of the most stunning films ever made. Blue Velvet has been one of the most acclaimed American pictures in recent memory; it spawned countless imitators and has had a lasting impact on popular culture. But after a second viewing last night, I just found it too dark and graphic to confront. For example, it displays a battered and beaten Isabella Rossellini lying under Frank Booth, a serial rapist as he screams for her to have sex with him, referring to him as her "daddy". I usually can stomach these kinds of films, but Blue Velvet was a major exception. It was too dark and violent to watch at some points, thus keeping me from enjoying the overall experience and having to fast forward some scenes. Mulholland Dr. was an amazing experience, America's answer to Fellini's 8 ½ or La Dolce Vita. Lost Highway also worked very well for me as a take on the noir genre. It fooled the viewer into thinking it was going to be some pulse-racing thriller, but switches moods in the final hour as an enigma rapped in a riddle sort of thing.<br/><br/>I will, however, give praise to the stark and provocative performances from everyone involved in this film. Rossellini missed out on an Oscar, as did Dennis Hopper, who I'm sure plagued everyone's nightmares after viewing this film. He is the kind of man we never really interact with, or shake hands, but encounter once in our lives, perhaps down the street, or in an alley waygod forbid I hope I don't. The symbolism is also marvelous, and it's a shame that its ruined by the at times pretentiously graphic sexual violence.<br/><br/>Please don't kill me but I just didn't enjoy Blue Velvet. I'm gonna give it a 7 ½ out of 10. I actually kind of ashamed to write that, as this film displays some genius and phenomenal art and film-making in general.<br/><br/>Rated R for strong graphic violence, language, brief nudity and sexuality. David Lynch (The Elephant Man, Eraserhead) shocked Hollywood and cinema in general to its foundations when Blue Velvet was released to public scandal in 1986. It was a small independent picture that broke boundaries and set standards for the way violence is depicted on film.<br/><br/>It was the first American film to fully explore the uncharted darkest regions of the subconscious mind, in the manner of European directors, like Bunuel and Fellini. No American director has broken open as much creative space as David Lynch, not even Robert Altman.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" was the right film at the right time. In 1986, there was a growing backlash against the vacuous Hollywood blockbusters, as evidenced by the popularity of artistically ambitous films like Platoon, Raging Bull, E.T., Hannah and Her Sisters, Salvador, A Room With A View, the Mission, and Children of A Lesser God. Movie goers hungered for more substantive films, and the pioneers of the art house megaplexes, like Landmark were anxious to corner the market those kinds of film. Bad news for your friendly neighborhood art house, good news for "Blue Velvet." "Blue Velvet" stood further left of center than other the films of artistic merit,and went far enough out on the limb attract a devoted cult following. In 1986, if you were in film school, "Blue Velvet" became an artistic model of achievement. Young directors aspired to make the next "Blue Velvet",not the next "E.T.", "Star Wars", "The Godfather" or "Jaws" as the previous generation had aspired to make.<br/><br/>On the eve of the 20th anniversary of it's release date, critics and movie fans still hold the meaning of "Velvet Blue" as a sacred topic of discussion. It's influence is tremendous but it still retains the uncompromising edge of an anti-movie film that overlaps countless genres until there are none left to class it in. It is a wild sex thriller, a Hitchockian mystery, a dark comedy, a tribute to B-movies.<br/><br/>The film is resistant,nearly immune to all attempts to probe the nature of it's meaning. The film offers no apologies for it's Baudelairian view of human nature. Debating the allegorical content of "Blue Velvet", seems to miss the entire point of David Lynch's artistic statement. Like Baudelaire, Lynch is at a loss to explain the brutal extremities of human behavior.<br/><br/>Each time I watch "Blue Velvet", I uncover new layers of meaning in, the script, the motivation of the actors, the function of a prop, or even in a the use of an unconventional camera angle. The "Blue Velvet" I watch in 2007 is entirely different from the one I saw in the theater in 1987. Lynch is one of the best currently active directors in America. His Mulholland Dr. and Elephant Man are two of my personal favourites; but I only heard of them because I had seen Blue Velvet. Which is a film (like Psycho), that you either detest and was initially questioned upon its theatrical release, but is seen as a widely known masterpiece today. I can see why some people do not like it, as it features a startling juxtaposition of sexual taboo and depraved violence.<br/><br/>It is not a film that the whole family can enjoy or a single viewer that is easily put off my violence or sex, but a film to be studied and embraced as a complex and confrontational refreshing masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is also an unbelievably fun film to watch with your friends, and for first time viewers, is well, like Frank Booth would say "a joy ride". It all depends on whether you are willing to go on one. 10/10. All the hype for Blue Velvet had me believing I was in for another classic cinematic turning point. I had heard nothing but acclaim and constant discussion on the film, a friend of mine had studied this at a university course and eagerly advised me to rent it out. I did last week at was quite disappointed. I suppose it was because I was under the impression I was in for a straightforward film, boy was I wrongbecause Blue Velvet is complex as complex can be. Of course, it's a Lynch film. I had only seen elephant man and parts of mulholland Drive a few years back and was disappointed at the lack of a coherent narrative. I did, however, enjoy the Elephant Man as an emotionally wrenching experience.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is full of symbolism, and is not the average Hitchcock inspired thriller, it's an original outlook on small-town life and showcases some very indecent sexual violence and assault. I'm not a big fan of those kinda movies (Pulp fiction, goodfellas kill bill, last tango in Paris). All in all, I'm going to say that if you savor refreshing, nightmarish and disturbingly depraved cinema, then see Blue Velvet at once. It's probably the best the genre has to offer. But if you enjoy film that is natural, and all-round beautiful then avoid it. It is one of the many "classic" films that appeal to selected tastes, like the films I've previously mentioned. 6/10. Lynch's disturbing, sensual, sickly funny masterwork Blue Velvet  his defining film  fascinated and repelled audiences upon its initial release in 1986. Closer in tone to his experimental, terrifyingly apocalyptic debut Eraserhead (1977) than to either his mainstream debut The Elephant Man (1980) or his follow-up fiasco Dune (1981), audiences were simply unprepared and cheerful for the experience. Although Lynch's distinctive style has become recognizable and less shocking over the years (and served as inspiration for such diverse directors as Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick, Jim Jarmusch, Todd Haynes, Gus Van Sant, Todd Solondz, Terry Gilliam, and the Coen brothers), at the time of its release it was stupendously shocking because there had never been a mainstream Hollywood film even remotely like it.<br/><br/>Many critics roundly condemned Blue Velvet in a way that made it sound like they were more disturbed by their own reactions to the film than by the film itself, one of the biggest detractors being Roger Ebert. Check out his pathetic reviews just for a laugh. However, despite this seemingly endless controversy, like the case with most things in life, the criticism has only made it stronger, and more celebrated than ever. Yes, my friends, Blue Velvet, today is considered an American masterwork. Check out all the top 100 film lists that celebrate its audacity.<br/><br/>The memorable opening of Blue Velvet introduces us to the idyllic town of Lumberton, where fresh-faced urchins stay in the crosswalks, firemen merrily wave from their hook-and-ladder truck, red roses line brisk, white picket fences, and neighbors enjoy the blazing sunshine as they hose down their impossibly green lawns. The view then plunges downward, through the turf and into the muck below, where monstrous beetles battle and screech  beneath the Norman Rockwell suburbia lies ugliness and violence. The story follows college student Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who's returned to his hometown when his father is hospitalized after a heart attack. Walking through a field near his home, Jeffrey finds a severed human ear. He takes the ear to the police and proceeds to investigate. Assisted by the wallflower All-American gal, Sandy (Laura Dern)...Beamount digs deeper into a bizarre, haunting underworld, featuring the psychotic, unforgettable Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Whether or not Jeffery returns unharmed and Innocent, is for you to find out.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet can be considered the 1980s answer to Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork Psycho (1960). Just look at the countless similarities. Both films where panned, and basically swarmed with controversy upon its release simply because no one had seen anything like it. Yet this made both films more and more sought after. Lynch manages to keep viewers intrigued, no matter how unflinching the situation/scene may be. He can keep the viewer intrigued; while watching Blue Velvet (yes, again, like Psycho), no matter who terrified we are  we simply must see more. Whether or not you come to embrace the film, you really have no acknowledge that it really is one of the greatest American films ever made. And years on, it is one of the few films to live up to its immense hype.<br/><br/>P.S. If you are to purchase Blue Velvet, or upgrade your current edition, make sure you purchase the 2002 Special Edition release, which features tons of bonus extras, a fantastic transfer, and lots of insight into the film from Mr Lynch and cast members themselves.<br/><br/>10/10, and very much so. Director David Lynch's father was a tree surgeon in real life. In one episode of Leave It To Beaver, Wally announces he wants to become a tree surgeon. Bugs and/or exterminators are mentioned several times on LITB. In Blue Velvet, bugs are presented and Jeffery pretends to be an exterminator. A ear is severed in Blue Velvet. In the Big Fight episode of LITB, a kid reports another kid had gotten his ear torn off. Hugh Beaumont played Ward Cleaver on LITB. In Blue Velvet, Kyle MacLaughlin played Jeffery Beaumont. In real life, Lynch was an Eagle level Boy Scout. On the series LITB, Wally and Eddie became Boy Scouts, Beav wanted to. In the art work of David Lynch he often uses dead, decaying animals.Beav mentions a dead cat on the show. Fire is a reoccurring theme in Lynch's work. Beav and Wally are fascinated by fire in the Shadow Lake episode of LITB.Beav is intrigued by magic/magicians and hypnotism/hypnotists. Magic/magicians are often referred to or featured in Lynch's work. Dreams are an important element to the director's work. Beav has nightmares several times on the series. Beav enjoys gory horror movies. Lynch fills his screen with grotesque images. The town of Mayfield in LITB is very much like the town of Lumberton in Blue Velvet. LITB refers to actor Jimmy Stewart several times on the series. Mel Brooks called Lynch "Jimmy Stewart from Mars." It's a strange world. There are many more similarities between Blue Velvet and other works David Lynch with Leave It To Beaver if you just look beneath the surface. i found this movie to be actually quite good. it definitely is quite unusual and you really do not know what will be around the next corner. a lot of this comes from the main characters doggedness and somewhat naiveness.<br/><br/>the story is about a young man named Jefferey, he is visiting his dad and decides to go for a walk, on this walk he finds a severed human ear. after this a lot more mysteries seems to fall-in place, and oddly enough they revolve around the ear he finds. it is quite the ironic story and somewhat unbelievable but very entertaining nonetheless.<br/><br/>the characters in this movie are great, everybody is perfect for their role and it all really helps to make the gritty dark feel of the overall movie.<br/><br/>there are a few plain stupid parts in the movie, but all in all i really enjoyed and i would definitely recommend it to any viewers looking for something new, something different and want to be entertained for the night. it is a nice little mystery that gets solved in the end, not much more then that. (possible spoilers)<br/><br/>Let me state it clearly: this is a very good movie and it deserves its status as a classic. Nevertheless, I don't think that it is the best movie Lynch ever made. In my eyes, that prize goes to Lost Highway or Wild at Heart, although this may be merely a matter of taste.<br/><br/>In comparison with some of Lynch's later movies (with the exception of The Straight Story), the plot in Blue Velvet is rather straightforward. I'm not going to repeat it because you can read some of the details here countless times already in other reviews.<br/><br/>But the absence of typical strange plot twists like in Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive, does not mean that this film is "easy" to understand, though. The strength of Blue Velvet lies in its imagery and its sexual symbolism. The lightning and camera angles are perfect, and the hallway at Dorothy Vallens' apartment is the precursor to the dimly lit, suburban house in the first part of Lost Highway.<br/><br/>As to the sexual symbolism: it is there right from the beginning. Jeffrey's father is incapacitated by his stroke and lies in hospital, unable even to speak. This scene right in the beginning of the story sets the stage for what you could see as a quest by the main protagonist Jeffrey for sexual maturity and adulthood. Sandy, the police officer's daughter Jeffrey falls in love with, represents the innocent ideal of almost platonic love. Nevertheless, interestingly, she appears completely out of the darkness at the beginning of the movie, and is actually the cause for Jeffrey to end up in the closet of Dorothy Vallens, spying on her. Dorothy is a much more aberrant and sinister female character and represents the darker subconscious underworld of pure lust, aggression and sadomasochism.<br/><br/>The movie can be seen as a confrontation with our own dark lusts and desires. When Jeffrey meets with the evil character of Frank Booth ("Daddy wants to f***"), this is made very clear to the viewer. Especially after the scene in the car where Booth turns his head towards Jeffrey and tells him "I'm just like you".<br/><br/>This is surely not all there is to the movie, and I'm sure other viewers would point at different forms of symbolism. But some of the stuff in this movie is pretty intriguing indeed, especially the sadomasochistic part. Whereas Dorothy Vallens first gets hit by Frank Booth and, incidentally or not, by Jeffrey himself (after asking for it herself), this situation turns around completely in the car scene later on. Now it's Booth who gets hit in the face by Jeffrey, and afterwards Jeffrey gets beaten up by him after the infamous "kissing scene". It's Dorothy who pleads Frank to stop. Later on, Dorothy is once again Jeffrey's saviour, when she appears naked on the porch at the moment when Mike is threatening to beat Jeffrey up in front of his house.<br/><br/>All in all a pretty good movie and worth watching several times for all the nuances and sinister suggestions. Blue Velvet is definitely the movie that shaped Lynch's later style, which would appear full blown in a movie like Lost Highway, where he brought all the themes from Blue Velvet to perfection.<br/><br/>Sadly, I think Blue Velvet lacks somewhat in the unfolding of the plot. Especially at the beginning of the movie, the gaps in the plot are too big. Some of the stuff in the beginning is also a little too unrealistic to my eyes. Why does Jeffrey immediately decide to sneak into Dorothy Vallens' apartment after meeting with Sandy? Just one case of where the psychological motivation is lacking from the characters. Which is a little strange in a movie that will later on become deeply psychological indeed. I've never seen so much blue. For those that could stomach it, "Blue Velvet" marked the revelation that even small-town American isn't safe from Hollywood's eye, and that it could be the place where the most evil of evils exists. Still, it's not hard to see why it's being hailed as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best thrillers of 20th-century America. I couldn't sleep this morning and as I was lying in bed, "Blue Velvet" suddenly popped into my head and I began to consider: What if my Virginia hometown houses similar evils? For innocent young college student Jeffrey Beaumont (a solid block of granite played by Kyle MacLachlan), such a nightmare has now become a terrifying reality. His world of white picket fences, red roses, and friendly firemen collapses as a result of this revelation. After his father suffers a stroke while watering the grass in the front yard and is hospitalized as a result, he rushes to his Northwestern hometown of Lumberton, U.S.A. (a real generic title for a town that represents all small towns in America). On his way home after visiting dad, he walks through a vacant lot and happens upon a severed human ear. He does the wise thing and turns it into the police, but he turns junior detective and further investigation with fellow innocent Sandy (Laura Dern) reveals a dark, violent sexual underworld of sadism and debauchery. There is one terrifying encounter when he meets Frank (a truly sadistic, obscenity-spouting, amyl nitrate-hogging pervert played by Dennis Hopper), not in person, or rather, through a closet door, as he rapes Dorothy Vallens (Isabelli Rossellini), who happens to be his unfortunate sex slave. This is of course after Dorothy has performed fellatio and stripped poor Jeffrey naked when he snuck into her apartment. What it all amounts to, is a shady plot involving a kidnapping and a possible murder. There are others, including Dean Stockwell as the all-too-suave pimp (?) Ben. His previous hits were "Eraserhead" (1977), "The Elephant Man" (1980) and "Dune" (1984), but they all seem like child's play compared to Blue Velvet; writer and director David Lynch had peered into the heart of America and ripped the damn thing out  it's still pulsating blood as I write this. Roger Ebert took one look at it and nearly had himself a coronary. He gave Blue Velvet only one star in 1986, but from reading his lengthy review of the picture, I got the feeling he did so out of terror, not a general dislike of what he'd seen. Lynch has made a career of directing bizarre, mind-bending films that challenge us, terrify us, and ultimately cause us to reevaluate the way we look at the world. It's hard to look at this picture now and realize its raw power, its dark seductiveness and the fact that according to Lynch, "Blue Velvet" was inspired by something he once saw as a child. He witnessed a naked woman walking down the street. You can pretty much see how an iconic image would shape a man's life as an adult: he makes totally f**ked-up stuff like "Blue Velvet." I would like to imagine if I could ever come up with something as equally twisted and dark. The film is often described as a prized personal work of the director. If one could say the same thing in an evaluation of this book, I would know I've done something right. A work that is done on an entirely personal basis may not resonate with some people, though guaranteed someone might go into a video rental store and happen upon a masterpiece  your masterpiece  and spread the word around that something truly great has just been discovered. Lynch's "Eraserhead" had such a fate, and so did the masterpiece "Blue Velvet." Blue Velvet is an oddity in David Lynch's filmography: the plot is deceptively straightforward, as opposed to Eraserhead or the messy Dune, yet it manages to be more haunting and nightmarish than any other film made by the brilliant visionary. It's mainstream, but also typical Lynch. It's his masterpiece. <br/><br/>Set in small-town USA, the film begins with Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle Maclachlan) making a creepy discovery: a severed human ear in the grass. After bringing the ear to the police, he decides to investigate on his own, and with the help of Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), whose father is in charge of the case, the young man finds himself in a situation he can't, or rather won't, be able to handle: his life crashes into that of mysterious night club singer Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rossellini), the story's femme fatale, and perverted psychopath Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), and once inside this evil place, there's no turning back...<br/><br/>Like the great Alfred Hitchcock (see The Birds, for example), Lynch is able to take a quite unrealistic plot and, despite that, turn it into a haunting picture, with the addition of his trademark nightmare sequences and perverse sexual subtexts (another Hitch inheritance, which Lynch managed to fine-tune and personalize). Don't get fooled by the apparently optimistic and unusually relaxing ending: Blue Velvet is an unsettling, twisted experience which will keep echoing in your head. It's a powerful picture, whose power lies in the fact that we're repulsed by the situations and characters, but also fascinated.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, each one is brilliantly portrayed by Lynch's talented ensemble: regulars Maclachlan, Dern and particularly Rossellini shine in their ambiguous roles, but it's Dennis Hopper who deserves the major plaudits for nailing one of the most disturbed and disgusting people to have ever hit cinema screens. Frank Booth is arguably the most repulsing individual Lynch's imagination has ever spawned, a man who can only express himself through violence, both verbally ("I'll f**k anything that moves!") and physically (the unsettling rape scene), and Hopper is flawless in this career-saving part (he hadn't done anything really important, bar Apocalypse Now, since Easy Rider). Shame he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. He probably would have triumphed as Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Evil can hide anywehre, even in the apparent peace of the suburbs, Lynch says. And we, the viewers, are nothing but mere voyeurs, like the movie's protagonist, forced to watch without being able to intervene, and that experience is horrifying and essential at the same time. That's the real power of Blue Velvet. I first seen this movie when i was a kid, about 10 or 11 years old, then i grew up, this movie kept coming to mind, I couldn't remember the story line, but i do remember some kid going to someones apartment to clean up. Also id remember that it was very weird and id not really have nightmares about it, but just thought that it was such an odd film for a child to see. I mean i was used to watching tom hanks movies loll, and then out of nowhere watching this. Anyway, it was just in December of 2005 (im 18 years old at the time), when i joined blockbuster and started to rent films, i had this film in the back of my mind for years and thought that this would be the perfect occasional to rent it, so i did. When i got home it was dark, i watched the film in my bedroom, by myself. I have to say that blue velvet is best movie I've seen in a long time. It has as instant 80's feel to it, really weird and surreal, i was griped and thrown into the movie from start to finish. The characters are so well written. Especially the character of Frank both. 10/10 stars for sure! A little shock value goes a long way. Storyline is great, but gets a bit sleepy at times; very real and believable and a good cast. Good drama with neck hair raising undertones..over and over. I't's definitely a weird flick.. I like it. I wish I had seen it when it first came out. If you're a Twin Peaks fan, you'll get a kick out of how similar it is to the series without having anything to do with it. Another fingerprint of David Lynch's earlier stuff. It's got the elements of your ordinary boring drama but there's so many pseudo idiosyncracies going on that you are thinking about it for several days after you see it. In my opinion, that's what makes a good movie. Recommended. David Lynch has a weird streak in him and he has a thing for Kyle Mcclachlan. Dennis Hopper plays the best insane psychopaths (Speed)and he does his best acting i've ever seen. Stylish and in some cases perverted, Blue Velvet is a beautiful film that has some extremely tense scenes ( no film can top the scene in which Jeffrey hides in the wardrobe and watches helplessly as Dennis Hopper rapes Isabella Roselini) the film is very good and chucks up some mad one-liners and some memorable songs, too. Overall a must-see for lovers of Twin Peaks. i rate this movie an 8 out of 10 for the style and intensity matched by no other film. Blue Velvet is probably the best example yet of the exploration of the hidden, dark side of seemingly innocent suburban life. As a mystery thriller, which is what the film is at heart, it works brilliantly and grips like a vice throughout but David Lynch layers the film with other facets creating a unique and unforgettable tapestry. Thus we have scenes depicting lurid nightmares and depravity (Frank's assault on Dorothy as witnessed by Jeffrey through the slits of her closet, Frank's kidnapping of and assault upon Jeffrey), scenes of banality (Jeffrey and Sandy chatting about beer), humorous scenes (Jeffrey's chicken walk), schmaltzy moments (Jeffrey and Sandy falling for each other), surreal moments (Dean Stockwell's Ben miming to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams") and moments indicating the humdrum, mechanical nature of small town life (the timber-carrying lorry trundling past the same crossroads periodically, the repetitive jingle of Lumberton's local radio station). A lot of these scenes seem to have wandered into the film from completely different movies, but that's clearly Lynch's intention with his nuanced approach. I particularly liked the Hitchcockian moment when Jeffrey first meets Sandy, with Sandy gradually materialising out of the pitch blackness a few seconds after we hear her voice. The performances in Blue Velvet are uniformly impressive but Dennis Hopper's portrayal of the psychotic Frank is outstanding and genuinely unnerving - how come he wasn't even nominated for the supporting actor Oscar?! Blue Velvet is a film where a grim or downbeat ending would not have been out of place or unexpected but Lynch isn't afraid to give the movie a fairly happy and optimistic one; it's the kind of ending which might not be to everyone's taste but I thought it worked well. The film is the work of a very talented and imaginative director at the height of his powers. Blue Velvet (1986) was David Lynch's return to what he does best. Surrealistic dramas. After the box office failure of his big budgeted sci-fi/ fantasy epic that was based upon the novel DUNE, Lynch was looking for a much smaller project. A returning into the mainstream Dennis Hopper makes a career renewing performance as the psychotic Frank Booth. This film was a much needed shot-in-the-arm for both men. They would both be immortalized in 80's Americana for this film. Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>The movie is about a "kid" (Kyle MacLachlan) who returns back to his hometown after his father is hospitalized. Spending time at his parents home, he meets a local girl (Laura Dern) and becomes smitten with a club singer (Isabella Rossellini). But he also crosses paths with a very nasty dude (Dennis Hopper) and his crew. What happens next is just plan weird. If you must know further detail (with out me spoiling it for you) then go out and watch David Lynch's BLUE VELVET.<br/><br/>An interesting film that shows David Lynch can make an effective movie under the restraints of Hollywood. But his lack of box office power has always worked against him. I have to strongly recommend this movie. It's not for everyone and those that are easily offended should stick to mainstream fare. O.K. So, I'd have to say that "Blue Velvet" is one of my favorite David Lynch films. All of Lynch's films are unique and visionary, but "Blue Velvet" fascinates me as it explores the psycho-sexual dark side of human nature. Jeffrey (Kyle Mclaughlin) lives in the peaceful town of Lumberton. When he discovers a severed ear, it leads him on a mysterious journey. He becomes obsessed with Dorthy Vallins (Isabella Rosselini), a sultry jazz singer whose son has been kidnapped. Then there's the evil sadistic Frank Booth, played flawlessly by Dennis Hopper. Frank has held Dorthy's son captive. Dorthy is blackmailed and forced to give in to Frank's depraved and violent sexual desires ..... some in which she enjoys herself. Jeffrey slowly gets caught up in a strange and dark underworld of criminals and perverts. The nice peaceful town of Lumberton is not so perfect after all. I'd have to say that Dennis Hopper gives the performance of his career as villainous Frank Booth. Who can forget that creepy oxygen mask? "Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!!!! God, I hope my neighbors don't behave like this. "Blue Velvet" is a psycho-sexual masterpiece. It shows viewers a dark and corrupt world that's hidden away by beauty and small town innocents. Oh my, Lynch seems to have really scraped the sheer darkest filth from the pit of humanity for this movie. That doesn't mean I don't think it's a brilliant movie... but it does mean that the backs of my eyelids feel tainted with flashing images of Dennis Hopper in one of the most evil characters I have seen for a very long time.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet isn't Blue, it's black. It's true neo-noir, Lynch style.<br/><br/>The word 'disturbed' is an understatement of how I feel right now (having just finished watching the movie). Is the tag line 'One of Lynch's most accessible and optimistic films' trying to be ironic?! Blue Velvet was nothing of the sort! The plastic ending was entirely superficial, and I'm almost positive that Lynch intended it to be perceived as such. Any desperate sense of optimism gleaned from that movie lasted about 10 seconds until the credits opened against the back drop of blue velvet and brought everything flooding back in a horribly mind warping way. The images of that movie stain your mind.. and the so called 'optimistic' ending did very little to remove those stains, for me at least. Granted there is some sense of good and triumph over evil.. but it feels incredibly contrived. I wasn't aware that Lynch was familiar with the idea of a 'happy ending'.. perhaps that's why the robin does nothing but glare at me, and the sunshine does nothing but emphasise the sheer lack of shadows. I can't escape the feeling that there is something lurking just out of the camera shot, waiting to destroy everything.<br/><br/>Lynch likes to toy with his audience.. the idea that he can pass something as dark as Blue Velvet off as 'optimistic' yet still manage to haunt our memories with his nightmarish vision is probably closer to his original intention than the initial audience reactions. After all, since when was anything as black and white as that with David Lynch? I think this film is not a crazily symbolic as many believe. every aspect can be analysed to the max but i think lynch aims here to take the viewer on a true roller-coaster ride. Each scene messes around with your brain and the use of sound and vision to create any mood succeeds greatly. The scene in which Frank ritualistically rapes Dorothy is intense and shows how game lynch is. Before this scene the film was a hardy boys story. a teenage gumshoe and then BAM!!! before u know it dean stockwell is singing into lightbulbs. Its plot is basic noir with a sadistic twist but the characters and the sub plots the film explores are spectacular. "Goddamn ur on suave f!@#er" David Lynch's masterpiece and the best film of a weak decade. Everything comes together in this Gothic American Nightmare that slips and slides around everything we think we believe in. Dennis Hopper was never better as Frank Booth, a psychotic, demented and truly dangerous sociopath with some real issues. Isabella Rossellini is incredible and touching as damaged and frightened Dorothy. Kyle Maclachlan was perfectly suited to this role and Dean Stockwell, in a small role, has the right touch of dementia and calm after his long and interesting career. Great music and cinematography. This film really scares some people and it should. This film is a real litmus test for film fans. You either love it or hate it (from all the people I've talked to about it).<br/><br/>A 10 out of 10. Best performance = D. Hopper. Lynch made other greats such as THE ELEPHANT MAN, ERASERHEAD, and TWIN PEAKS (on TV). If you haven't seen this film, you've never been to America. From the opening scene, Lynch has you trapped. Great Roy Orbison song IN DREAMS is used brilliantly. Good support from Brad Dourif and Jack Nance and normal chicks Hope Lange and Laura Dern. One Oscar nomination for this (director) and the Academy nominated Hopper for HOOSIERS instead of this - a cowardly move by them. Hopper also made Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE II the same year. This is one of the strangest and most interesting films ever! David Lynch <br/><br/>Blue Velvet <br/><br/>This movie is a playground in which Lynch develops his trademark dark moody velveteen sets, pitched against the veneer of normality in a sleepy suburban town. Its strongest points insurmountably being held in the Cinematography which I feel is stunning and leads us directly into his 'Twin Peaks'  Is this the same town? One has to ask.<br/><br/>The basic story is follows our lead character Jeffrey (Kyle McLaughlin) who returns to his hometown for his father's funeral. Whilst walking he discovers a rogue mutilated finger which he takes to the police and begins to unravels our story by unveiling a dark and sinister side to his airbrushed, perfect suburban town.<br/><br/>Jeffery & his senior high aid and perpetual tease, Sandy (Laura Dern) become embroiled in a blackmail story in which Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) is providing Frank (Dennis Hopper) a local sycophant with sexual favours so he will not harm her son.<br/><br/>There is a sexual intrigue with Jeffery & Dorothy that displaces the purity of his platonic relationship with the beautiful and pristine Sandy. Jeffery is troubled by the extent of his sexual deviation, which is highlighted in the scene where he beats Dorothy  if not only briefly it is still wrong to him. Does he then compare himself to Frank, who seems to embody all he despises, the answer I believe to be yes.<br/><br/>This setting of Lynch's perfection masks a skewed or grotesque world in which Frank (Dennis Hopper) provides the performance of a lifetime. The young and naïve Jeffery (Kyle) gives us a limp and weak performance overshadowed by Hopper and Rossellini.<br/><br/>It is not the first times directors have used this setting of Americas suburbia, Stepford Wives, American Beauty, Traffic, Twin Peaks and Fargo to name a few. They all have a creepy edge and show that there is always an undercurrent no matter how much you try and fence yourself off from the world. This film for me is ahead of its time and is highly critical of the void between normality that which you find odd. It is also current with the USA's vehicle of a 'Fear Nation' of all things on the fringe.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is a platform for Lynch to move on, it has all his signature dream sequences, which he does so well, tying the symbology to the film he loves so much. I was impressed with the settings and contrast of dark colour against light shots, however eventually I felt the story to fall down a little and become flimsy when it could have been much more. This is not to say I did not enjoy the movie, I just felt that it didn't make that 8/10 but rather gets a respectable 7/10 for the voyeur scene of Hopper & Rossellini if nothing else. <br/><br/>An intelligent film that attempts to delve into America's underbelly and uncovers more than the average film-goer would probably want I'm not gonna talk about the IMDb rating this movie deserves (I think it must be higher), but this movie unifies David Lynch's obsessions. Probably this (and Mulholland Drive) are his best films. They define Lynch's intenctions (oniric worlds, dark soundtrack, unusual characters). Many people are used to put the "weird" word besides Lynch's works (which style of directing is not pretentious). For that people who think this movie takes Hitchcock style, maybe they would have to check Brian DePalma... ...but Lynch's style not came from Hitchcock, Lynch's style go beyond and creates an atmosphere where the suspense is not the only factor. Characters, shadows, music...all play to create this masterpiece. Kyle Machlahan worked for a while in Lynch's movies. He played a correct Paul Atreides in "Dune", his Jeffrey Beamount in this movie is great and his Dale Cooper from "Twin Peaks" is...wow! He is a great actor which screen presence maybe is not so needful in this movie. Hopper's it is!he is THE character of this film. Jeffrey is the leading actor but not needed of big screen personality because of his character.<br/><br/>Great movie, Mr. Lynch. Almost a fever dream film, Blue Velvet was David Lynch at his earliest and his best. I applaud his work, and appreciate the effect that it has had on several other directors. People have quoted in saying that Woody Allen's films are now much darker due to Lynch's work, and American Beauty is more a sit-com compared to this film. What I love about Lynch is there is a reason for everything in his films. While they may seem reckless or pointless, there is purpose to his madness. I didn't catch this until the middle of this film. I then began to not only watch the actors on the screen, but also what was happening behind them. Look at the lights, look at the set design, there is so much to a Lynch film that one viewing will not cut it.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was turned down by several actors because they thought it was too "pornographic", but in essence, Lynch is trying to show the absurdity of suburbia. It is a story of a boys sexual awakening. In the beginning of the film, we see how suburbia has changed Jeffrey into doing the "chicken dance" for Dern, because he feels that is the way to seduce her. His sincerity is there, but it isn't until he meets Dorothy that his true sexual nature is revealed. As I watched this film, I was reminded of my youth. I was an avid reader of the Hardy Boys novels, and this movie took me back to that time of reading about the mysteries of the Sunken Ship or Broken Clock.<br/><br/>Lynch puts Jeffrey into this world of amateur sleuthing that helps create that Hardy Boy feel. While the mystery is simple, it is the characters that keep you watching for more and more. <br/><br/>Although others have mocked the performances (on the DVD it has Ebert talking about how disgusting it was for Rossellini to take her clothes off), I feel that it is necessary to keep the feel of the film alive. Without these performances, you would have had a "normal" 80s thriller. Lynch is my favorite director out there, from "Twin Peaks" to Mulhulland Drive, Lynch proves time and time again that you can tell a story from an absurdist point of view and still make a powerful film. Take the time to watch this film, go out and rent it, and I will guarantee that it is like no other film you have ever seen. <br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of ***** I am an old man, not nearly as smart as you whippersnappers! Tried to get into this new cinema stuff and started with David Lynch. I did not think some of the characters were believable at all. Jeffrey Beaumont is not believable; I never knew anybody who would take these kinds of chances. Especially after he got up close with Frank Booth on the joyride, nobody in their right mind would go back to the Deep River Apts unarmed. His dad had a gun at home. Laura Dern I thought was real cool, and I went to high school in the 50's and lusted after people of this nature. Dean Stockwell, who I first saw in The Boy With the Green Hair in the early 50'd was great lip-synching Roy Orbison. Dennis Hopper was not convincing to me. I have know a few psychopaths and a few crackmeisters in my time, and he overacted like crazy. I am no prude and am not repulsed by a 4 letter word for intercourse, but the dialogue was pretty damn banal. Isabella Rossellini would have been better if she had some orthodontia. Now I have a few questions. Tom Gordon; why was he just standing there in the apartment when Jeff came in? He was alive, he spoke to Jeff, and Frank shot him at the end. Who was the Van Gogh character? Was it Dorthy's hubby, and if it was, why were he and yellowman in her apartment? The first one of you wiseacres who tells me this doesn't matter, I am going to kiss with lipstick on. Now, go figger. This is the most frightening movie of all I've ever seen -- and I've been watching movies since the 1950s! Nothing tops this.<br/><br/>If you've never been menaced/attacked by a true psychopath, this is as close as you can get without genuine danger. I don't know that I could actually meet Dennis Hopper in person after seeing this performance.<br/><br/>My comments about the movie end here.<br/><br/>Apparently IMDB has vast quantities of unused space on its servers; they require a minimum of "10 lines" of copy before they will publish your "comments." Perhaps if I were a paid reviewer for some slick magazine, I'd go right ahead and delve into the plot issues, imagery, lighting, direction, cuts, acting quality, etc. Since I'm not, I've said what I had to say, and that's all I have to say. Sorry that it happens to be trenchant but insufficient in volume! IMDb mark: 8<br/><br/>This is one of David Lynch's weirdest films. It is exactly what we would expect from the director of 'Twin Peaks'. And it features quite a few of his favourite actors, whom we see working together in a lot of other productions he was involved in. And maybe that is also why the actor performances in this movie are very good.<br/><br/>-Ending: I pretty much liked the ending, especially what happened during the climax of the film. Of course, taste varies. 24/30<br/><br/>-Shock Value: No thriller can be interesting without some captivating moments that shock the viewer. 'Blue Velvet' has its fair share. Like when Frank comes over and Jeffrey is hiding in the closet. 17/20<br/><br/>-Suspense: The film alternates between being a police movie and a real shocker. And the latter part is when it gets really interesting and suspenseful. It doesn't maintain the same mood throughout. 12/20<br/><br/>-Nudity: Dorothy can be seen briefly nude when she's with Jeffrey, and then, later, topless for a longer period of time. 7/12<br/><br/>-Beginning: The first minutes of the film are cool. They do a good job of drawing the attention of the viewer, in my opinion. Of course, taste varies. 5/5<br/><br/>-Soundtrack: Very effective, I can't complain. And the two main songs, 'Blue Velvet' and 'Candy-Coloured Clown' are very nice. 5/5<br/><br/>-Cast: They became even more famous after acting in this film, than they were when they started working on it. But this wasn't the first motion picture for either of: Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell or Brad Dourif. So, as you can see, the cast is solid. 3/4<br/><br/>-Genre: This is a thriller. 3/4<br/><br/>-->Overall: 76/100<br/><br/>To sum it up, 'Blue Velvet' is not as weird and twisted as 'Twin Peaks' but, still, it is strange and won't appeal to everyone. From Swordlord, 3 swords up! David Lynch is a true surrealist!!!  If you do not find this film bizzare and disturbing than you have missed the point.  Basically this is Lynch's study of the multiple layers of society.  Kyle finds himself thrown into an underworld that he becomes facinated with.  He meets a series of disturbed characters that suck him into a wierd plot of kidnapping and abuse. Filled with Lynch's trade mark suspence and lots of rediculous plot twists. Hopper is to good and Rosellini as well.  A GREAT FILM.  Please do the the industry a favor and see this movie.<br/><br/>PS Roger Ebert is a prude (see the Siskel and Ebert review of the film that is on the DVD). My Rating: **** out of ****. <br/><br/>The first time I saw Blue Velvet, I did not like it. I considered the film to be interesting at times but flat most of the time. However, I decided to give it another try. WOW. I was blown away by the film. It interested me but it also had a gripping energy that is rare in many films. It is a film of many strengths and theres no doubt in my mind that it is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>
Blue Velvet's acting is definitely a strength. I am not a fan of Kyle Machlachlan but he is undoubtedly perfect for this role. The same thing for Laura Dern and there is definitely chemistry between them. Isabella Rossellini is plagued as an actress, she is the daughter of Ingrid Bergman, one of the greatest actresses that ever lived. That is one hell of an act. Rossellini will definitely not live up to that. However, she must be given alot of credit for this role. She is perfect here, this is not an easy character to grasp but she does it. She took a chance with this role, not only appearing nude but I bet some actresses would be disgusted with this character. Not Rossellini who does it perfectly and though she wont live up to her mother, this role is no minor entry to her resume and her mother would be proud. <br/><br/>As perfect as Machlachlan, Dern, and Rossellini are, Dennis Hopper is the standout. He portrays the character like it is, a ruthless villain. Like, with Rossellini's character this charcter may disgust some actors. Hopper plays the character like he is meant to be. In doing so, he creates one of the best villains ever on film. <br/><br/>David Lynch's films have always been visually fascinating, Blue Velvet is no exception. The opening shots that represent the American Dream are beautiful. The film is loaded with dark atmosphere thats very appropriate for this film. <br/><br/>Blue Velvet is called "The Most Talked About Film Of The Decade", its decade was the 80s. Theres no wondering why, Blue Velvet was ahead of its time then and it has a very dramatic effect on the viewer. Some of the film's subject matter is not pretty nor is it meant to be. There are unattractive scenes in this film that are highly effective, but might disturb a viewer but then again thats the point.  <br/><br/>Blue Velvet is not a perfect film, though it is close. The one part I find a little odd is Sandy (Laura Dern) talking about her dream. It makes a connection to one of the last images of the film but it comes off on the lines of preachy, well maybe not preachy but something like it. However, thats a minor complaint about a Masterpiece. Its not for everybody, but for people who understand this film you will be amazed. 'Blue Velvet' tells the tale of Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan), a teenager who one day stumbles upon an ear in a field. The story is set in a perfect American town, where everyone seems to be nice and happy. The ear links to an eccentric Night Club singer, Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) and a drug- addict criminal, Frank (Dennis Hopper). In support is Laura Dern as Jeffrey's girlfriend, Sandy. Mystery leads to more mystery as Jeffrey begins to investigate the ear. David Lynch wrote and directed the film, and received an Oscar Nomination for Best Director. He directs with a unique visual style, that's very refined and stylish, and at the same time, it reminds the viewer of a dream. He is able to capture the atmosphere of this "perfect" world with a dark side perfectly. The Oscar Nomination was rightfully deserved, and even though I am very fond of 'Platoon', Lynch should have won Best Director. The script is also intriguing, and the film is visually gorgeous. Content wise, this film is quite graphic. It contains nudity, violence, swearing, and drugs. The flaws are minor, and result mostly in the film being too slow or too dull. While not as engaging as 'Mulholand Dr.' or as humane as 'The Elephant Man', 'Blue Velvet' is still a film to remember. 9.75/10 It's not clever, it's not cute, it's not meaningful and it's not scary. It's just a big waste of time.  Go watch your toliet flush, you'll see much of what you see here.  There are some qualified actors here -- a few -- whose talent is utterly wasted on this overly stupid plot.  Pretentious and shallow and not even slightly self aware, this is a film for only the most terminally brain dead. This was a descent movie. I'm a huge Lynch fan and have been watching this movies sort of in reverse chronological order, so maybe I'm spoiled. But I thought Lost highway was way better than Blue Velvet. Better acting, better cinematography. And as crazy of a plot as Lost Highway was, it kind of made sense.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet was just really random. I could deal with the cheesiness of the acting between McLaughlin and Dern, but then Dennis Hopper busts in and makes absolutely no sense. All the crap he started yelling out when he was first intriduced (with mclaughlin in the closet) was a little too random for me. I thought blue velvet has its share of funny scenes, Dennis Hopper is a madman in this film. I also like Lynch's style of direction. He has certain methods he uses to film shots, similar to Stanley Kubrick. I thought Rossellini played a great part as an abused singer, the acting is very good in this film, it's just that the script is so bland and cheap. I think Dennis Hopper did not have any parts in the script, he must of inprovised the entire film. I do not consider this movie to be an american classic. I give it ** stars for direction, and acting. Thats about it. BLUE VELVET is certainly not a film to everyone's tastes but if you are willing to be taken deep into darkest hell and spat back out into a world of love then please watch this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beaumont is a normal college student who happens to like mysteries and when he finds himself in the middle of one there is no way of comprehending just what he's got himself into. <br/><br/>Isabella Rosselinni is absolutely phenomenal as a tortured night club singer and Dennis Hopper is terrifying as a pyschotic in love.<br/><br/>
A dark, moving and sometimes funny classic. This is one of my favorite films of all time!<br/><br/>The thing I love most about David Lynch is that he pushes your mind to its very edge and just when you think everything is back to normal, he pushes you over the edge. BLUE VELVET does just that.<br/><br/>BLUE VELVET is surrealism at its finest. The cast is brilliant! Dennis Hopper is beyond disturbed, a true cinematic monster! Isabella Rossalini's tortured Dorothy Vallens is both beautiful and tragic. One of Kyle Maclachlan's best performances! The cinematography is in traditional David Lynch form high levels of contrast and eye-popping colors!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one yet go pick up a copy today! The film starts like a glossy 50s melodrama with colourful suburban gardens complete with white picket fences and a neighbourly shiny red vintage fire engine serenely passing by.  However, it isn't long before we're left with little doubt that a darker, murkier side is awaiting us, as the peacefulness is broken by a gardener's cripplingly sudden cardiac arrest followed by stark close-ups of parasitic beetles.  This is a clever and beautifully shot taster of the film's overriding theme; that violence is always a threat even within America's seemingly most ideal small town environments.<br/><br/>The plot centres around the gardener's son, Jeffrey Beaumont, who is brought home from school after his father's collapse, finds a severed human ear and his youthful curiosity gets him involved in the intriguing mystery of singer Dorothy Vallens which ultimately leads into the violent world of local sociopath Frank Booth.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite films of the 1980s although, like one of my other favourites Raging Bull, because of the realism of its violence, it can be hard to watch.  The direction is superb and the cast all turn in career best performances.  MacLachlan is likeable in a Jimmy Stewart kind of way as the all American boy (Jeffrey's father owns the local hardware store as did Stewart's in real life).  His character was no out and out rebel but the film shows that even wholesome naïve adventurousness can be enough to fall into American society's seedy underbelly.<br/><br/>While Dern is endearing in her portrayal Jeffrey's robin loving sweetheart and is the film's purest representative of innocence, Hopper and Rossellini's characters represent the darker possibilities of life. Valens is one of film's all time great femme fatale's whose world has been made intolerable by the gas guzzling Booth, possibly cinema's scariest psychopath.  Rossellini was required to gain weight for the film and is both vunerable and self-destructive, yet her sexuality is understandably appealing to the young   Jeffrey.  Hopper is quite simply scary but somehow manages to make his despicable character sympathetic.  What makes Frank Booth so terrifying is that he is allowed to move freely among society seemingly without detection.  This is no caged psychopath we're dealing with here.<br/><br/>This film gets 10 out of 10.  It's a classic but not one for the faint hearted. Its a strange film full of memorable characters, the yellow man, the well dressed man, Raymond, (CLAP) Paul, Van Gough and a great character Ben, he is a candy coloured clown called the sandman. Frank Booth who is not very Neighbourly... one of the funniest films i have seen, extremely inciteful, baby wants Blue Velvet, mommy, mommy baby wants to **** How come David Lynch is such a genius because his movies look like he picked out nouns from the dictionary at random and placed them wherever he wanted in the movie? How come "genius" directors are so genius by making no sense? How come it is acceptable to have giant gaps in logic and to always write it off as art? This movie made me sick. I demand David Lynch give me back my two hours of my life I lost watching this no sense artless waste of film? This film is not artsy, or "avante garde"...he's just babbling to himself. What a dark and disturbing film and yet it's not so far from the truth. It was hit dead on with the line, "It's a strange world".   This film explores just that.   Under the image we put out to society we all have a darkness that we keep hidden.   We're all the same.   Some choose to display this darkness, others keep it hidden.   Even in a small remote town displayed in Blue Velvet there are secrets that are not meant to be explored.   To us it may seem that Lynch goes a bit too far with some of the scenes but just think about it: What is too far?   Anyways, Lynch did a great job.   I still have yet to see all of his pieces but this ranks up there as one of the best films made that contains so much meaning.   Do not overlook this movie, it's one for the ages. 10/10. Love him or hate him, David Lynch cannot be ignored. This film, possibly his most famous (and probably his best, although many people will have differing opinions), is one of the most controversial movies ever. While it is on many people's "Top 100/200 Films" lists, Roger Ebert gave it one out of four stars in his initial review. I am in the first group, the one that thinks that "Blue Velvet" is a masterpiece. In the Lynch filmography, it is somewhere in the middle in terms of hyper-reality. It is not the phantasmagoriphica surreality of "Mulholland Drive", "Lost Highway", or "Eraserhead", but it is not the straight-faced drama of "The Straight Story" or "The Elephant Man" either. Few films of more power, more emotion, and more determination to stare unblinkingly into the dark side of human nature have ever been made. As is Lynch's style, he gets a great everyman (Kyle MacLachlan as Jeffrey Beaumont) to symbolize humankind as he puts the character through unimaginable, oftentimes surreal experiences that are disturbing, yet truthful in one way or another. Few films are more challenging and disturbing than "Blue Velvet", as well. The subjects of the movie are kidnapping, murder, drugs, sadomasochism, rape, sexuality, and Roy Orbison songs. Add to that Dennis Hopper's character Frank Booth, a being of seemingly pure evil, and you have yourself a terrifying descent into depravity and sickness. I have rarely been as scared as when I was watching this film. Films are best when they ask the viewer to think about the subject on the screen, and that is what "Blue Velvet" does best. Are you a bug or a robin? That question is the heart of "Blue Velvet", David Lynch's masterpiece and one of the great movies of all time. The story of a man (Kyle MacLaughlan) who discovers a human ear and is lured into the seedy underbelly of a conservative American town.  Featuring an interesting cast of strange characters and some excellent suspense scenes, this is a solid thriller.  Some scenes are very raw and intense, which tended to polarize most critics, either loving it or hating it.  Either way, it's not as bad or as good as most seem to think, suffering from a somewhat incoherent plot and a tendency to become a little too weird for no good reason.  Overall, its merits outweigh its flaws, and it is well worth watching. "Blue Velvet" is the least of my favorites by David Lynch.He is an interesting filmmaker and has made some films that I really enjoyed.In "Blue Velvet",not only was I watching a film that was perverted in certain ways and not only was his film hard to follow,but I found myself being drawn away from the movie."Blue Velvet" is not one of David Lynch's best films.He tends to make the viewer feel like he or she is trapped inside a world that is dark and way to weird to fit in.I am alright with that.But this film has brought so many emotions through me that I wasn't sure what to think of this film.Basicly watching "Blue Velvet" was like waking up from a nightmare and yelling,"Mommy"! **Major spoilers**<br/><br/>
"Blue Velvet" is sure to polarize audiences, even more than fifteen years after it first came out. Not a shred of its potency has faded--it's just as wrenching and powerful as it's ever been. It doesn't matter if you regard it is a masterpiece or as pornography (and both sides made equally vehement arguments), it simply refuses to be ignored or forgotten. Roger Ebert panned the film, and has recently stated that he still stands behind his initial assessment. Any work that can produce such strong feelings after so many years is certainly worthy of consideration. In any case, its proponents seem to have won the argument; the film has withstood the test of time. It never seems the least bit dated in any scene. Repeated viewings only confirm its effect.<br/><br/>In the film's central set piece, a woman is raped by the sadistic drug dealer Frank, aptly played by Dennis Hopper. This upsetting scene made many people angry; some even went so far as to accuse it of exploitation. This is a purely knee-slap response. Anyone who can look at the film in an objective light will see that there is no glamorization of rape. David Lynch doesn't make it exciting; he makes it painful and ugly, as it is. The worst part is that people like Frank Booth really do exist, although most of us are fortunate not to cross paths with such individuals. He is more a symbol than a character, the personification of every evil, vile thing spawned by humanity. Hopper is commanding in the role, with a performance that cannot be done justice with the English language.<br/><br/>The next best performance belongs to Isabella Rossellini as the brutalized victim. Few performers would accept such a difficult role, and even fewer would successfully pull it off. Kyle MacLachalan is somewhat bland, but this characteristic actually works in his favor. It's a matter of contrast--the bland suburban world with the dark criminal underbelly. This contrast is exemplified during the aforementioned rape scene, as well as another odd part, which seems right out of a John Waters movie. The juxtaposition is jarring and bewildering, compelling us to identify with the protagonist. Perhaps Laura Dern is a bit annoying, but that was probably intentional, part of the film's theme of contrasting the banal with the horrific. It doesn't hurt that she is only present when absolutely necessary. Dean Stockwell and George Dickerson add excellent support as other players on both side of the conflict. Brad Dourif has a cameo as one of the henchmen.<br/><br/>"Blue Velvet" can be viewed on many levels: as an "art flick," a crime thriller, a coming-of-age parable, or even a very, very dark satire. Regardless of how you perceive it, there is a common theme weaving its way throughout the film: the loss of innocence. Jeffery has never dreamed that such terrible things exist, but he is given a rude awakening in the most disconcerting possible manner. The personal and moral consequences of his curious inquiries will no doubt haunt him for the remainder of his existence.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by De Laurentiis Entertainment Blue Velvet, David Lynch's 1986 film, as I've been told is something you'll love or hate.<br/><br/>I don't know where to honestly stand with this, I suppose I feel like Jeffery, trying to stand in the middle, yet this is a film that can't be view with black/white interpretations. Intriguing and extremely intense.<br/><br/>This is not a family film, Blue Velvet may look rosy (excuse the pun) on the surface yet underneath it exposes some very dark perceptions of suburbia, far better than American Beauty ever did.<br/><br/>David Lynch has something with visuals, which is very evident in BV. The cast of BV are all OK, with two exceptions. Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini. Hopper's psycho Frank Booth is extremely irritating and scary. Rossellini's performance as Dorothy is simply raw almost sickening ( for some people it is sickening) as it is brave.<br/><br/>Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern symbolise both the shades of grey and innocence. Hopper and Rossellini both emulate the very dark underbelly of Every Day Typical Ordinary Small Town - the opening and closing images of Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>I recommend this to those who are open minded,who like challenging and art-house type films (this is definitely not mainstream) and who won't be turned off by parts of it's very unpleasant nature, that lies underneath the surface. <br/><br/>8/10: Australia: R18+ (Medium Level Violence, Sex Scenes, & Corse Laguage. ) One of David Lynch best movies, even if it's a typical Lynch movie, it's not as unapproachable as his 2001 MASTERPIECE "Mulholland Dr.", still it has many of its qualities. A strong but mysterious storyline, good action, and it's special mood.<br/><br/>Both Kyle "Dale Cooper" MacLachlan and specially Dennis Hopper give great preformances, Hopper in maybe his most memorable. Laura Dern also give a good role. But Isabella Rossellini stinks up every scene she's in, the woman can't show any feelings, look at the scene in the car at night, when Hopper is beating ut MacLachlan, and watch her reactions, I'm laughing, it almost ruins the hole movie. This is most definitely a David Lynch film-you can't mistake it for anything else!  His fingerprints ar all over this one.  Lynch is an acquired taste and usually underwhelms me, but I liked this one, in spite of the fact that Kyle "My career peaked with Showgirls" McLachlan was in this.  Mercifully, there is enough real talent around him to keep his "acting" to a harmless minimum.  Dennis Hopper chewing scenery helps dampen Kyle's leaden drag on the proceedings.  Worth watching. Exciting setting of the light in the film that creates mysterious environments and situations. Each frame of the film is like a painting. Desolation and lonliness are dominant feelings in the film. Groovy music and an excellent recreation of the fifties. BLUE VELVET hints at the supernatural and the demonic the way TWIN PEAKS tackled the subject full bore. In this film there is a HOLY SEE CLUB sex brothel ssytem beneath the surface tied in with corrupt mobster FRANK BOOTH. In the film, two local people in their late teens or early 20's uncover the seedy underbelly of a culture within a culture. There are other things hinted at in this film, filofem, and a blackmail system that puts people into a sort of slavery. Blue velvet is at times absurdly amusing and disturbingly dark. It would seem that this well made film shows us a slice of the underworld teetering on the edge of insanity. A interesting film, complete with the classic "mommy mommy" line. Blue Velvet is similar to TWIN PEAKS but is much more dark and is entertaining to watch but makes one wonder do people like this rreally exist...the troubling thing is turn on the tv news..the answer is yes. While there are currently a lot of films dumped on videotape and sold at very low prices, I discovered 'Blue Velvet' yesterday. Seeing the year it was made in (1986), I was afraid it would be a bit out of time. Definitely not the matter. I found it controversial and shocking, not for me but I think many people will think so. I found a film like CRASH quite shocking because of the gay contents and I thought it didn't have anything to tell. This is different for 'Blue Velvet'. I think Dennis Hopper did a marvelous job, never seen him better. Very over-the-top acting yet credible and pretty frightening. The over aged bubblegum bimbo dancing on the car, while the main character gets beaten up is just hilarious. The rest of the cast was o.k. as well. If you've never watched it, a true recommendation. 9 out of 10. Sorry to comment again but after reading other user comments I wanted to add something.  Many praise Lynch for showing the dark underside of American suburbia.  I think he utterly fails here.  To me the town doesn't seem to have a facade of wholsomeness at all.  It has drug problems, ghettos and the sort all out in the open.  With the exception of the opening scene (the fire fighters etc) Lynch just lets it go.  I would have loved to see a bigger contrast and think it would have saved this dragging work. Blue Velvet could have been a great film. David lynch is without a doubt a very talented and skilled director, and it shows in Blue Velvet. This is a film of raw emotional power and takes the viewer into the underside of American life. Performances are passably, with top honours going to Dennis Hopper. However, i couldn't help but shake off the feeling that Lynch was trying to force his beliefs to the viewer, instead of mixing it in to the story. This, i think, distracted me from really enjoying the movie more and i was a bit disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>Guido's rate: 2 Stars Blue Velvet is one of the most disturbing films that takes the theme of image over substance and literally strips naked the facade of wholesomeness and happiness and instead leaves the viewer to grapple and stumble through the darkness, brutality, and reality.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Lynch is a master of the deeply strange and disturbing. Blue Velvet opens with an idealistic shot of American suburbia, and slowly pans from an upwards view of red roses against a white picket fence.  Children play, a fireman rides by and waves at the camera in slow-motion. It's a sunny day, and a man is outside watering his green lawn.  Suddenly, he grabs his neck and falls to the ground, screaming, while his little dog plays with the water spewing from the hose. It's obscene, and the camera slowly angles down into the black, crawling insects that wriggle and live underneath. It's a brilliant beginning, as the film trudges deeper into the underside of this all-American town.<br/><br/>Later, his son, Jeffrey, finds an ear in a field.  His curiosity sparked, he decides to investigate the circumstances along with the help of a policeman's daughter, Laura Dern.  As Jeffrey plunges into the belly of the town's hitherto concealed darkness, his innocence is shattered and his life is tainted with violence, fetishist-sex, filth, and mysoginy.  Think American Beauty without a big cast or Hollywood-ized script or visual style and played very, very darkly.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper is nothing short of terrifying and repulsive as Frank Booth and gives the best, most chilling villain performance of his career.  Hopper looks as if he's actually teetering on the brink of insanity, and the scene between he and the enigmatic Dean Stockwell is a perfect balance between absurdity and oddness.  Isabella Rosselini also turns in a curdling performance.<br/><br/>Lynch, however, does not bash the white-picket-fences dream of life, nor does he ultimately let evil win and let seeming "goodness" become folly. Though the experiences he leads Jeffrey through are grim, desperate, and horrid, the ending does offer a sense of hope.<br/><br/>Certainly not as mainstream as other films that have dealt with the deception of appearance over reality, Blue Velvet is a dark and often unpleasant journey into darkness; Lynch creates a nightmarish landscape of his own brand of hellish truth which may be ugly and uninviting, but the audience is fascinated by and must look, even when they are told not to.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 "Blue Velvet" is a very sad movie for starters. The Isabella Rossellini character is both sexually dangerous and melancholy sad. Dennis Hopper's sadistic character brings the movie alive when entering every scene he's in. This is a sharp edged film with many dark surprises. People love to talk about how they would like to have their lives a little more exciting or a little stranger.  But if you're leading a life like Isabella Rossellini's in this movie, you must be begging for an ordinary life.  Also, we may talk about having weirder or more exciting events in our lives but when we it comes to movies, the average moviegoer seems to want everything to be plain and simple so that he can understand all that is going on and not have to ask any questions at the end.  Well if you feel you're one of those moviegoers, you won't want to see Blue Velvet.<br/><br/>  David Lynch.  He is one of the most underrated directors in Hollywood today and even though I am not fond of all his movies, I have to say he is very talented and seems to have a liking for weirdness.  In fact, his movies are so weird that the only movies that are as weird as one of his are his others.  On IMDb, when we look for a recommendation for another movie in the same style and we're on a movie that Lynch directed, most of the recommendations we'll find will be other David Lynch movies. <br/><br/>
  The movie's plot revolves around a coincidence.  One day, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is walking home from the hospital where his father is and accidentally finds a human ear on the ground.  This ear will allow him to discover many things: a bar singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) whose husband and son have been kidnapped, a crazy maniac named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) who has apparently captured Dorothy's husband and son, and many other weird adventures that are signed by David Lynch. <br/><br/>
  The movie is too weird to be explained in less than 1000 words but I can tell you that it is worth watching, primarily for the weirdness.  Yes, it is very weird, sick, gross, and perverted as well, but Lynch seems able to make a good connection between all of these characteristics that the movie has and is able to make this connection rewarding.  He earned himself an Oscar nomination for best director.  Furthermore, Lynch was able to add to the movie a certain visual beauty through the horrors taking place on screen which are pleasing to the viewer. Even if you are in that category of moviegoers that like the movies plain and simple, you should give this one a shot and see that you weren't making a mistake by watching it. Moody and colorful movie about weird events happening in small, quiet town in U.S.A. Kyle MacLachlan is fabulous in the main role as young man who finds an human ear from the field and starts to look for answers to explain this odd founding...<br/><br/>Best David Lynch film ever and this excellent teamwork of Lynch and MacLachlan continued in the Twin Peaks, one of the best series still even today... This film is not perfect, and it tends to be a bit overrated. But it sure has its moments. David Lynch, I do believe, is a genius. This movie is so incredibly intense that it can be hard to watch. Much of the intensity stems from the Isabella Rosselini-Dennis Hopper characters and their relationship (not to mention their remarkable performances). On the other hand, the film has a slow feel to it, and by the end, it seems to be dragging slightly. But see it anyway, it's quite an experience. I'll admit I'm not a fan of Mr Lynch's, so this negative review might not surprise you.<br/><br/>DL - for me, if someone who loves to make deep artistic scene's using all the tools of a filmmaker, but he tends to use them for the sake of it, not enhancing the story line or script.<br/><br/>Take Blue Velvet, some bizarre characters a very simple (boring) story, so why have all these drawn out scene's that don't say anything or add anything.  It's just to say, ah lets make this scene arty, why, I dunno, just do it.<br/><br/>DL - Is obviously talented and can create a wonderful depth to a film, but until he actually applies it to a story that needs it, it's all wasted.  The only time he actually made a film that I liked, it was a masterpiece (Elephant Man) and for once he didn't use the old DL clichés. This film was interesting but sometimes the characters would start acting sappy and it broke the mood of the film. For fans of Twin Peaks, SA Dale Cooper plays a lead role in this movie. Interesting in that it exposes the hidden 'dark side' of small towns and of people.  Also that people are not what they seem on the surface.  I thought 'Blue Velvet' was rather tedious in illustrating these points.  However, I will say that Dennis Hopper plays depravity to the max. Also, I am grateful for those that bring us these 'different' films.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained. After coming into contact with this film through a college class, I decided to check it out for myself and was very impressed.  The cinematography is incredibly artistic and I don't think I'll ever see everything Lynch wanted me to see.<br/><br/>The characters are very fitting for Lynch.  Once again, he shows the nasty underground of an otherwise very normal and hokey small town. Pros: Score, Cinematography, David lynch's directing, Kyle Mclahan Cons: Overacting by Hopper, Dern, and Rosellini<br/><br/>Top critics really hated this movie when it came out but one of the best movies of the eighties. David lynch's bizarre tale of a seemingly normal surburb but actually and underbelly of crime exists. Lynch infests his alter ego into Mclahan and leads him into a strange tale of sadistic men, strange women and wierd encounters. Lynch at his best. Laura dern, Dennis hopper, Kyle Mclahan and Isabella Rosellini add wonderful acting to the film.<br/><br/>Premise: An ear is found by Mclahan and he must find out who has it and how it got there<br/><br/>Blue velvet was nominated for a single oscar (Best Director)<br/><br/>Grade: 9.2/10 (Required viewing for lynch fans) It's a Strange World<br/><br/>Blue Velvet has a colorful beginning.The suburbs with a idyllic lifestyle.It seems that nothing wrong could happen here.It reminds me films like American Beauty and the classy presentation and haunting music it's similar to Chinatown. Jeffrey(Mc Lachlan) is a young innocent man with a hidden and dangerous obsession with a mysterious complicated woman, makes him flirting with a vouyer/sado phase.<br/><br/>The first hour of Blue Velvet is slow but fascinating.At the beginning of the second hour is a little tedious at times.The problem I guess is Denis Hopper.He is not a good actor.Casting him as a Psycho sadistic man was a big mistake .Every time he appears it is just annoying. Blue Velvet has space for two great underrated actresses:Laura Dern .She almost a David Lynch Muse.Her role as a school girl is a little bit miscast because she was too old to played a teenager but that is exactly the purpose of it.She convinces us that she can be a naive teen.And Isabella Rosellini was very brave for portraying a risky role none Hollywood actress would dare to do her part.<br/><br/>I liked the nightmare like quality of Blue Velvet and the conclusion of the mystery is brilliant(the last 10 minutes) BUT I'LL give Blue Velvet 6/10 Only because Dennis Hopper ruined the movie. David Lynch returns with more of his warped ideas, this time revolving around a bizarre triangle between three people. A shy man who found an ear in the woods, and triggers a murder investigation; a tortured cabaret singer and a psychopathic killer fueled by his own manic sexual obsessions. The three of their lives collide and intertwine creating a very tense and well done thriller.<br/><br/>A local student finds an ear and triggers a murder investigation, and later finds the investigation connected to a woman whose apartment he investigates. He witnesses, whilst hiding in the closet, an awful rape by the psychopath (played brilliantly with verve and character by Dennis Hopper) and he vows to help the tortured woman.<br/><br/>All the murder and mayhem tie unsettlingly back to the fabric Blue Velvet, which Dennis has quite a fetish for.<br/><br/>Blue Velvet is an expose on small town America: exposing the underbelly of a seemingly harmless town. One scene gives you that notion perfectly: a man driving by on a fire engine, waving to the camera with a huge smile on his face. Obviously a nice man, but underneath, like the rest of the people in the town, there's a dark side. That's essentially what the film's about: our dark side.<br/><br/>Through disturbing imagery and a cunningly devised plot, also backed by strong performances by all the characters, namely Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell and Dennis Hopper, "Blue Velvet" proves to be an interesting film experience. It's one of David Lynch's better movies.<br/><br/>Nine out of ten. Of all the David Lynch films, this by far is one of his greatest, a comment on the American suburbs. What appears rosy white and pristine on the outside harbors a world of dark mystery and dastardly characters.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper rings in one of his finest performances to date as an evil sexually deviant villain. This is a must see for any Hopper fan. Although the strength of the movie seems to rest in Isabella Rosallini, whose performance is simply awe inspiring.<br/><br/>This film is classic modern film noir. A must see. I must say that i am a David Lynch fan in the same way i am a Woody Allen film. I like their styles, i just can't enjoy their movies.<br/><br/>As far as DL is concerned, i think Lost Highway is without a doubt his best movie, and seems to be the only one that warrants repeat viewings.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Blue Velvet after discussing my dissapointment with most of Lynch's other films. It was suggested i view it as it was one of his better ones.<br/><br/>It was strange, it was thoughtful, it was boring.<br/><br/>Yes... it's strange... just like all his other movies are. Yes... i'm sure there's a reason for the strangeness (although, after seeing parts of Firewalk with me i am no longer so certain), but i believe that most of the time it does not relate to the story, or in a larger sense, the narrative.<br/><br/>The acting is at times banal and at best bearable (not just during the light moments as some would have you believe). The dialoge (as with most other Lynch films) is difficult and unpolished. The direction is probably the best part of this film, indeed the lighting and imagery are pleasing. But my philosophy has always been that a good movie requires a good plot... and this one is pretty weak.<br/><br/>With Lynch's recent efforts (im thinking in particular here of The Straight Story) it seems that he is no longer the elite filmmaker some would like you to believe... just a man able to make the films he wants, whether they are interesting or not.
