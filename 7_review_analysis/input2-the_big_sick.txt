Ironically, Kumail Nanjiani, the lead actor in this film stands out as a terrible actor against the fantastic talent of Zoe Kazan, Ray Romano, and Holly Hunter. I say, "Ironically," because it is the lead actor's project and story! Zoe Kazan is adorable and charming as his love interest, but he is flat and wooden, which has the effect of creating zero chemistry between the lovers in this romance.
